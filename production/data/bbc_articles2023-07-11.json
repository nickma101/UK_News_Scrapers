despite judging it to be very serious.<br/>A new timeline from the corporation says an email was sent followed by a call that failed to connect.<br/>The presenter was spoken to seven weeks after the initial complaint, the night before the Sun published the claims.<br/>The initial report has been denied by a lawyer for the young person.<br/>The allegations, first reported by the Sun, are that a BBC presenter paid a teenager for explicit photos - however, a lawyer for the young person, who is now 20, has disputed this version of events.<br/>The Sun have not put up anyone for interview regarding the BBC's timeline and did not directly respond to questions put to them. <br/>In a statement released on Tuesday, the BBC said it had been asked to pause its investigations into the allegations while the police assessed the situation. <br/>It comes after detectives held a virtual meeting with BBC representatives on Monday.<br/>The Met Police said it had made the request while it continued its assessment \"to establish whether there is evidence of a criminal offence being committed\". <br/>If the presenter obtained sexually explicit images of the young person when they were under 18, that could be investigated as a possible criminal offence.<br/>However, the family told the BBC they had contacted the police and were told nothing illegal had taken place.<br/>They said their primary concern was stopping the alleged payments being made to the young person, who they said was struggling with a drug problem. <br/>\"Without the money, my partner's child would have no drugs,\" the step-father alleged to the Sun.<br/>There have been questions over how the BBC has handled the complaint, which director general Tim Davie acknowledged was damaging to the corporation.<br/>Mr Davie addressed some of the issues while speaking on Tuesday as part of the publication of the BBC's Annual Report. <br/>The family of the young person first contacted the BBC on 18 May, when they attended a BBC building to make the complaint in person. <br/>A day later, on 19 May, the complainant contacted the BBC's Audiences Services, with the allegation passed to the BBC's Corporate Investigations Team. <br/>Mr Davie was asked about the difference between the complaint on 19 May, and the complaint made in The Sun story.<br/>In a summary of the 29-minute call received on 19 May, Mr Davie said it \"did not include an allegation of criminality - but was very serious\".<br/>The family member then did not respond to an email sent by the corporation, the BBC said in an updated timeline released on Tuesday afternoon. <br/>On 6 June, a follow-up phone call was made to the number provided by the family member to the BBC's Corporate Investigations Team, but \"this call did not connect\".<br/>\"No additional attempts to contact the complainant were made after 6 June, however the case remained open throughout,\" the timeline added.<br/>A senior manager only held a conversation with the presenter involved in the allegations on 6 July, seven weeks after the initial complaint was made. <br/>This was to make them \"aware of the claims being outlined by the Sun\" in their story published the following day, the BBC said.<br/>The BBC made contact with the police regarding the complaint on 7 July.<br/>In a statement on 9 July, the BBC said it had suspended the presenter in question. <br/>Addressing why it took weeks to speak to the presenter, Tim Davie said allegations the investigations team \"needed to balance the concerns of duty of care and privacy.\"<br/>\"You don't take that complaint directly to the presenter unless it has been verified.<br/>\"It is right to validate that and to have the specialist team talk to the individual before taking it forward,\" he told the BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. <br/>But, he said he wanted to examine whether the BBC raises \"red flags quick enough\" of complaints of this nature.<br/>In the same interview, Mr Davie was also asked whether he knew \"categorically\" if the presenter paid for the legal fees of the young person.<br/>\"That's not information I am party to,\" he said. \"I don't even think that's something for the BBC,\" and nor is whether the presenter and the young person have spoken, he added.<br/>This timeline of events laid out by the BBC conflicts with the Sun's initial report that the BBC did not call the family after the initial complaint was made.<br/>In the paper's report on Monday, it was stated: \"The family say no-one from the corporation rang them for a proper interview after the initial complaint.\"<br/>However, this appears to be contradicted by the Sun's latest interview with the parents of the young person, in which the step-father is quoted as saying allegations were put to the BBC \"for an hour\".<br/>The corporation added that it had published an update to the timeline of events to address questions on how the complaint was initially managed, setting out key dates and adding some more information.<br/>\"The BBC has processes and protocols for receiving information and managing complaints when they are first made. We always take these matters extremely seriously and seek to manage them with the appropriate duty of care,\" the statement read.<br/>At a virtual press briefing relating to the publishing of the BBC's Annual Report, the director-general confirmed he has asked \"for a review\", which will be internal, of how things are red flagged.<br/>He said: \"Any affair of this nature is serious.

The current level is 6.17%, compared to the peak last year of 6.51%.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice.

Figures published on Tuesday show UK wages have risen at a record annual pace, fuelling fears that inflation will stay high for longer.<br/>The expectation of further increases has pushed up the cost of funding mortgages, and so lenders have been raising the rates they charge customers. <br/>At the hearing, Andrew Assam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group, told MPs this was changing the plans of first-time buyers.<br/>\"People are either putting down a larger deposit or buying a smaller property because affordability is tighter,\" he told MPs. \"We won't lend as much now, so people are moderating what they can afford to buy.\"<br/>People coming off fixed deals and looking for a new one could potentially have to pay hundreds of pounds more a month.<br/>Around 2.4 million fixed-rate mortgages are due to end between now and the end of 2024, according to figures from banking trade association UK Finance.<br/>Aaron Strutt, from mortgage broker Trinity Financial, said that the uncertainty of the situation made it difficult for lenders to price mortgages. A rush of people trying to secure deals at lower rates had meant the money allocated by some providers to lend in mortgages was drained. <br/>He added that there was evidence of a split with large numbers of people renewing with their existing lender, without the requirement for further affordability assessments.<br/>The recent rises in mortgage costs are also likely to have a knock-on effect on renters who could face higher payments as landlords seek to recoup the rising cost of higher mortgages. Squeezed landlords may decide to sell properties, which could lead to fewer homes available to rent, according to the National Residential Landlords Association.<br/>Following a meeting with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, lenders agreed to some flexibility and making sure homes are not swiftly repossessed from those struggling to pay.<br/>Labour is also planning to hold its own mortgage summit in the coming days.<br/>Read more here<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Are you struggling to pay your mortgage?

This is likely to be a reflection of the Radio 2 afternoon show being cut by an hour, as well as Mills' exit from his 5 Live Saturday programme.<br/>Vanessa Feltz left her early breakfast show on Radio 2 and her BBC Radio London morning programme in September for a new job on Talk TV, and as such she too has dropped off the star salaries list.<br/>Her former colleague Ken Bruce left his mid-morning programme in March to join Greatest Hits Radio, but as he stayed with the BBC virtually until the end of the accounting period, his salary for last year was steady at \u00a3390,000.<br/>He will drop off next year and his replacement Vernon Kay will almost certainly feature instead.<br/>News personalities Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel also left the BBC for the commercial sector at the end of the previous financial year, which means they no longer feature on the list.<br/>But there are also new entries. Rick Edwards made \u00a3178,000 after replacing Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio 5 Live's breakfast show. <br/>His co-host Rachel Burden's salary has gone up slightly to \u00a3195,000 - but she also guest-presented some editions of BBC Breakfast.<br/>Today programme presenter Justin Webb earned \u00a325,000 more than last year, taking his salary to \u00a3280,000, after he took on a new role presenting Americast.<br/>Victoria Derbyshire has also been given a raise of \u00a350,000, bringing her salary to \u00a3295,000, as she took on a new role presenting Newsnight.<br/>The threshold for appearing on the salaries list is \u00a3178,000. The only Radio 1 presenter whose salary was above that was Greg James, who earned \u00a3335,000 for hosting the station's breakfast show as well as Radio 4's Rewinder.<br/>BBC Breakfast host Sally Nugent appeared to make slightly less (between \u00a3178,000-184,999) than her co-presenter Jon Kay (\u00a3185,000-189,000), despite hosting more editions of the programme than him.<br/>However, it is not a like-for-like comparison because Kay's salary does not constitute a full year in that role, as he only took over from Dan Walker in July, and his earnings will include work undertaken in his previous job as a news correspondent.<br/>The salary list shows four women are in the top 10 this year, an improvement on last year's three despite the departure of Feltz.<br/>BBC newsreader Sophie Raworth (\u00a3365,000) and 6Music and Desert Island Discs host Lauren Laverne (\u00a3390,000) are now in the top 10 highest earners, as Wright and Mills dropped out.<br/>News anchor Huw Edwards climbed from sixth to fourth place, with his salary up by \u00a325,000 to \u00a3435,000.<br/>The highest new entry in the list, with \u00a3260,000, was Ros Atkins, one of the hosts of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show as well as the corporation's analysis editor.<br/>The salaries list is nowhere near a complete picture of what top talent at the BBC earn, as so many stars are paid through production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm BBC Studios. <br/>The government previously agreed that BBC Studios did not have to disclose talent pay so it could be treated on a level playing field with the rest of the commercial sector.<br/>That means household names such as Michael McIntyre, Tess Daly, Paddy McGuinness, Alex Jones, Jools Holland and the Strictly judges are absent.<br/>Quiz show hosts Richard Osman, Sandi Toksvig, Victoria Coren-Mitchell, Romesh Ranganathan and Alexander Armstrong are also not named.<br/>Similarly, the casts of some of the corporation's biggest dramas such as EastEnders, Happy Valley, Peaky Blinders, Casualty, Call The Midwife and Doctor Who do not appear on the list despite many actors undoubtedly making large sums from the BBC.<br/>Some stars do appear on the list, but only for some of their BBC commitments.

It really scared me\".<br/>\"I just was like, 'Wow, maybe I have a little bit of an alcohol thing.\"<br/>The realisation prompted him to extend his no-drinking rule for another month, but he found it hard to resist England's drinking culture. <br/>\"I felt like I couldn't be social,\" Holland said. \"I felt like I couldn't go to the pub and have a lime soda. I couldn't go out for dinner. I was really, really struggling.<br/>\"I just sort of said to myself, like, 'Why? Why am I enslaved to this drink? Why am I so obsessed by the idea of having this drink?'\" <br/>Shaken, he set himself a target of going six months without drinking, and felt he had turned a corner when he celebrated his 27th birthday on 1 June.<br/>By that time, he said, he was \"the happiest I've ever been in my life\". <br/>The star went on to list some of the benefits he'd felt since giving up drink.<br/>\"I could sleep better. I could handle problems better,\" he said. \"Things that would go wrong on set, that would normally set me off, I could take in my stride. I had such better mental clarity. I felt healthier, I felt fitter.<br/>\"I'm happy to say it - I was definitely addicted to alcohol. I'm not shying away from that at all.\"<br/>The Spider-Man star added that getting sober had had some knock-on effects. He has distanced himself from the rugby community \"because so much of it is about how much can you drink\". And he also inspired his mother to get sober.<br/>\"She's loving it, and it's been amazing,\" he said. \"I can't believe the difference that I feel from not drinking. Yeah, I feel amazing.\"<br/>Holland is currently nine months into a year-long break from acting, after a gruelling shoot for the Apple TV series The Crowded Room.<br/>Speaking last month, the star said he had found it \"tough\" to play a character based on \"the campus rapist\" Billy Milligan, a US man who claimed to have 24 alternate personalities.<br/>Milligan was the first person to be found not guilty of his crimes by reason of insanity - on the basis of dissociative identity disorder - and instead of going to prison he spent a decade in psychiatric hospitals.<br/>\"We were exploring certain emotions that I have definitely never experienced before,\" Holland told Extra TV. <br/>\"And then on top of that, being a producer, dealing with the day-to-day problems that come with any film set, just added that extra level of pressure.<br/>\"I'm now taking a year off, and that is a result of how difficult this show was.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Tom Holland: \"There are kids who look up to Spider-Man\"<br/>Although the past year has seen him confront difficult issues, the actor has been supported by his girlfriend and Spider-Man co-star Zendaya.<br/>Speaking to the Smartless podcast last week, he said he was \"lucky that I have someone like Zendaya in my life\".<br/>\"It's interesting being in a romantic relationship with someone that is in the same boat as you,\" he added. <br/>\"You can share your experiences and all that sort of stuff - and that's worth its weight in gold.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Tom Holland to take a year-long break from acting<br/>'There are kids who look up to Spider-Man' Video, 00:02:12'There are kids who look up to Spider-Man'<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But for some young people who have been in care, support can drop away when they reach 18 and leave the care system.<br/>\"Daniel will be part of our life forever. He's as much part of the family as me,\" says actor and presenter Joe Swash. <br/>Joe's mother, Kiffy, has been a foster carer for more than 11 years - Daniel came to live with her when he was seven. Now aged 18, he lives away while studying at university - but his home is still with Kiffy.<br/>\"My mum can't wait to get him home,\" says Joe, adding that as far as Kiffy is concerned, her role is far from over. <br/>\"You don't just suddenly grow up at 18,\" he says. \"As for Daniel, that's a job for life for my mum.\"<br/>In the UK, young people officially leave care at 18. Under England's guidelines they are still entitled to some support from their local council up to the age of 25. This includes access to a personal adviser who takes over responsibility for supporting the young person, offering advice and information to help them live independently.<br/>However, support can differ slightly depending on a person's age and time spent in care. Kiffy says she was shocked when Daniel turned 18 and \"nothing clicked in\" for him.<br/>A charity for children in care and care leavers, Become, says many young people are expected to be independent before they are ready and often at a moment when they most need stability.<br/>It says many of the young people it works with, describe approaching 18 as like a \"cliff edge\" or \"like being on death row\".<br/>\"They're counting down the days until their 18th birthday, because that's when their placements are stopped and they're basically expected to become independent overnight,\" says Clare Bracey, director of policy and campaigns.<br/>\"When you think about that in relation to other children who are living with their parents, that support doesn't get cut off overnight.\"<br/>The support young people are entitled to after 18 can vary depending on where they live and their local authority.<br/>\"One of the things that young people say to us is, nobody should become a care leaver, care shouldn't leave you,\" Clare adds.<br/>Young people can face a multitude of issues when leaving care, according to the charity Action for Children. <br/>Independence can mean having to move into new accommodation, finding employment or training, managing finances, paying bills, budgeting, and learning how to cook and shop. Life skills which people usually learn over a period of time.<br/>Joe Swash has made a documentary about the care system for BBC One. He feels there is no point sending young people out into the world and asking them to look after themselves without the life lessons or the skills they need to enable that.<br/>\"Once you fall through that net, there's not many people there to catch you,\" he says. \"I almost feel like we're setting them up for failure.\"<br/>In January 2022, the regulator for children's services, Ofsted, published a report into care leavers. It found more than a third of people in England, who had been in care and who responded to its online survey, felt they had left too early and did not feel equipped with the skills to be able to live more independently. <br/>Karl, 18, spent time in four different foster placements and three different care homes before the age of 14. He then moved to a privately owned children's home. As he approached 18, staff helped prepare him by teaching him the life skills he'd need before he moved out. But he says he felt frightened and anxious all the same.<br/>\"It's the real world at the end of the day, like I'm put into adulthood,\" he says.<br/>Karl would have liked to have stayed on a couple more years to adjust.<br/>\"It does feel like it's forced on to me,\" he says. \"It's just another challenge at the end of the day for me to face. There is no structure to it, there's no firm ground to hold on.\"<br/>Joe Swash says he also worries about the lack of emotional support for care leavers - something he says most people take for granted.<br/>\"It's not until you meet these young people that are vulnerable - they're anxious about their future, they haven't got all this around them.\"<br/>An independent review of children's social care in England, commissioned by the government, was published in 2022. It concluded that the care system needed a complete reset.<br/>Josh MacAlister, who oversaw the review, says the system was built for younger children, not teenagers, and that the past few decades have seen a growing number of teenagers in care, along with high demand for children's homes and not enough foster homes.<br/>He says one of the missions in the review is that every young person reaching the age of 18 should have \"at least two people in their life that love them, two lifelong loving relationships\".<br/>\"If you don't have that, it leaves you kind of anchorless at sea,\" he says.<br/>The Department for Education (DfE) says it provides a range of support for care leavers to make the move from care to independent living as smooth as possible, and that the allowance for those leaving care has recently risen from \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000. This can be put towards purchasing essentials, such as furniture or white goods, when they move into their first home.<br/>The DfE also says it provides funding to local authorities to support young people leaving care from children's homes, by providing an offer of move-on accommodation, alongside a package of practical and emotional support, \"provided by a member of staff from their former children's home or from someone who they know and trust\".<br/>Clare Bracey from Become says she would like to see this scheme extended to ensure all care leavers up to the age of 25 receive this support - rather than the current proposal, which is to 23.<br/>In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there are also attempts to offer more support to young people transitioning from care to independent life until the age of 21 - and to provide after care support until the ages of 25 or 26.<br/>Joe Swash says society also has a responsibility and it is vital to have adults who are \"willing to put their neck on the line for these young kids\" and look after them beyond the age of their time in care.<br/>Joe and his wife, TV personality Stacey Solomon, have spoken about fostering in the future. Joe says they have seen how fulfilling it has been for Kiffy.<br/>\"All the most important things you need to provide for that child are free - and that is your time, your love, your energy,\" says Joe, \"and that's what my mum has done with Daniel. <br/>\"My mum's not a rich lady, she's not got loads of money, but she's got loads of love and loads of time and I think that's priceless.\"<br/>Watch Joe Swash: Teens in Care on Tuesday 11 July at 21:00 BST on BBC One.

Ukraine fears what happens if they don't.", "author": "By Gordon Corera", "datePublished": "2023-07-11 04:03:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-11 17:04:29.002245", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "BBC", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/F720/production/_130346236_gettyimages-1517819739.jpg", "body": "Out in a dense forest in central Ukraine, troops from a Ukrainian artillery battery are training before heading out to the front lines. <br/>For some it will be a return to the fight, for others it will be their first time - as they replace those who have been injured or killed. <br/>Firing at targets in a clearing with AK-47 rifles, they are careful to conserve ammunition. And it is not just training camps where supplies are low.<br/>\"We have enough fighting spirit to win, of course. Unfortunately, we currently do not have enough weapons,\" Roman, their commander, tells me. \"The main thing is to have enough ammunition.\"<br/>Out on the front lines they are having to economise, he explains. \"This is not a secret. The amount of ammunition that the enemy uses daily is at least five times higher than the amount of ammunition that we use.\"<br/>Supplies from allies have been essential for Ukraine in this war. For Roman and other soldiers, the Nato summit in Vilnius is a crucial moment to ensure they have what they need to continue the fight.<br/>The widespread expectation is that new weapons will be promised at the summit, as well as more supplies of ammunition. The US decision to provide cluster munitions from existing stockpiles last week was partly to act as a stop-gap before new artillery supplies are ready. <br/>But viewed from Ukraine the summit is about much more than just weapons and ammunition - it is about what type of commitment the country will be offered when it comes to joining the alliance.<br/>Ukraine has been knocking at Nato's door for years. What it wants is more than just positive noises and a feeling of being left in a permanent waiting room.<br/>At the core of Nato is Article 5, which sets out that an attack on one member is an attack on all. This principle of collective defence could offer protection for Ukraine, but - almost everyone agrees - is very difficult to put in place when a country is already at war. <br/>\"We believe that it is long overdue to invite Ukraine to Nato,\" Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine's foreign affairs minister, says. <br/>\"An invitation to join Nato does not mean an immediate membership in Nato. We are cognizant of the fact that as long as the war goes on, Ukraine won't be able to join Nato. But we are talking about the invitation and setting the clear timeframe for this to happen.\"<br/>The 2008 Nato summit in Bucharest casts a long shadow. Ukraine, along with Georgia, was told membership was on the cards in the future - but with no clear path and no expectation that it would be anytime soon. <br/>That angered Russia but without offering any protection in return. Georgia was attacked in 2008 by Russia, and Ukraine attacked too - first in 2014 and then in 2022. Many of those US officials involved in the decision in Bucharest now acknowledge it was a mistake.<br/>This time Ukraine wants greater clarity and concrete assurances. The exact nature and timetable of any commitment could have real consequences for the war. For instance, offering membership only when the war is over might encourage Russia to maintain a low level conflict to stall membership, some analysts argue. <br/>But there are existing Nato members who are cautious about offering too much to Ukraine now. They fear this could draw Nato closer to war with Russia. <br/>That is a view that is met with some annoyance in Ukraine.<br/>\"Let's be honest: for a long time, Nato has been paying too much attention to whether Russia will allow them to do anything,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the office of the President of Ukraine, told me when I visited his heavily guarded office in the centre of the capital. <br/>\"Nato must say unequivocally that there are no more preconditions for this related to Russian threats.\"<br/>Ukrainians view membership as a way to end the war by deterring Russia rather than escalating it. They acknowledge, as US President Joe Biden has made clear in recent days, that Ukraine needs to make the reforms that any prospective member has to undertake. <br/>But they argue that Nato was set up to confront Moscow in the Cold War and yet it is now Ukraine which is effectively fighting on Nato's behalf, defending its eastern flank against Russia with its soldiers and civilians dying every day. <br/>For many in Kyiv, the focus by some inside the alliance on the risks of an invitation are a mistake. What, they ask, are the risks of not acting? <br/>In public, Ukrainian officials are careful to sound optimistic and not to enter into any discussion of the consequences if they receive only vague promises and looser \"security guarantees\". They do not want to sound ungrateful for the weapons and ammunition they still need right now. <br/>But privately officials worry that in the long term a failure to bring Ukraine into closer alignment with the West will be used by Moscow to push a narrative within the country that Ukraine has been let down and the West cannot be trusted. People could feel betrayed, one senior official told me.<br/>Without formal membership, the fear is the West could tire of supplying the weapons and ammunition Ukraine needs as the war grinds on. That is something Vladimir Putin and Russia is counting on. <br/>So in Kyiv do they worry about that? <br/>\"I have a counter question: what does it mean to be tired of supporting Ukraine?\" presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak remarks when I put that question to him. <br/>\"This means that democracy does not know how to defend itself.

Shells struck the house, she says.<br/>There's emotion in her voice as she explains what the building used to be like. <br/>An old photo she sends via WhatsApp shows a large property with balconies and a pond in the front garden. Images taken after the attack capture the soot-stained, crumbling walls left by the assault.<br/>But Mrs Pylypenko and her family now have a new home in the garden of their old one - a factory-made house that was assembled in just a few days last autumn.<br/>The building, a donation to the family, was one of the first homes of its kind built by Ukrainian firm HOMErs, which says its designs could benefit millions of refugees and people still in Ukraine who have lost their properties in the conflict. <br/>HOMErs, previously known as Tera Monada, has a range of modular houses, made from standardised factory-made units that slot together quickly to achieve the desired final design. <br/>Given the extent of damage in Ukraine, any reconstruction efforts will have to be both fast and cost-effective. In March, the World Bank estimated that it could take $411bn (\u00a3323bn) to rebuild the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has, in the past, put the figure at $1tn.<br/>\"There are about 200 destroyed houses in my community,\" says Mrs Pylypenko. \"Modular houses are absolutely important for us.\"<br/>Her new property is significantly smaller than her old one, she notes. But it is the only such building in her village and accommodates six, including Mrs Pylypenko's 10-month old granddaughter. Her daughter, who was pregnant at the time of the Russian attack on the village last year, was brought to Poland by volunteers where she gave birth.<br/>Lots of Ukrainians, sadly, know this predicament, says HOMErs co-founder Alex Stepura.<br/>\"In our own company, so many of our people lost their accommodations, their houses, their apartments,\" he says, pointing out how makeshift shipping container homes have become a common sight in the country during the past year or so.<br/>In order to provide a more appropriate solution, Mr Stepura and his colleagues have developed modular homes that are comprised of multiple three-by-three metre units. An entire house as well as furniture and white goods can be flat-packed and loaded on a single lorry, he says.<br/>To date, the company has supplied around 50 homes to families in Ukraine, a spokesman for HOMErs says. In a video shared by the firm, factory workers slot a wall section into a foundation piece and rotate a lever downwards, locking the two tightly together, demonstrating the ease of construction.<br/>HOMErs' Kyiv factory is currently producing around 10 homes per month, according to Mr Stepura's business partner Chris Baxter, a British investor. But the pair are hoping to raise roughly \u20ac5m (\u00a34.2m) to build a new factory in Slovakia, which would boost production to a couple of hundred homes per month, or so.<br/>Mr Stepura has decades of experience in engineering and robotics. His companies produce vending machines and drones, for example. Some of those drones are currently deployed on reconnaissance missions for the Ukrainian military, he adds.<br/>The modular homes should be high-tech but also intuitive and easy to use - the architectural equivalent of a new smartphone, he suggests.<br/>It must be said that there's nothing new about this idea. Modular homes been around for decades and many companies, including Ikea, have invested in the concept. Mr Baxter argues that the HOMErs modules will attain a good balance of quality and affordability. <br/>One grid-connected, fully furnished, three-module home costs $18,000 (\u00a314,000), with additional modules priced at $6,000. The designs might offer a good solution for Ukrainian refugees currently living abroad who hope one day to return home, suggests Mr Baxter.<br/>\"Those houses can be packed up and moved together with the people to repopulate the country as quickly as possible without having to wait for all of this construction to take place,\" he says.<br/>Such a thing is possible in theory, though \"little tested\" says Gemma Burgess at the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research.<br/>That said, rebuilding towns and cities with modular properties could be a smart way to go, she adds.<br/>\"In Ukraine, if you're trying to build large volumes of housing, it might be a much cheaper, more efficient way to do it.\"<br/>There are other ventures in Ukraine using the latest technology to help communities rebuild after shelling or missile strikes. Take the 3D-printed school in Lviv, which is currently undergoing a second phase of construction. Or the prefabricated concrete building panels developed by Ukrainian firm Well-being ConTech.<br/>All such efforts ought to avoid repeating the rush to build properties - often of low standard - that followed the Second World War in countries including the UK, adds Dr Burgess: \"Quality and sustainability is going to be key.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Mr Stepura emphasises his commitment to high quality design and accurate manufacturing. Mr Baxter is taking delivery of one of the modular homes himself, where he will live while his UK house is renovated in the coming months. He points out that his version will come with pre-installed solar panels on the roof. <br/>The modular homes also feature 200mm-thick insulation in their walls - roughly twice the UK standard.<br/>Mrs Pylypenko praises the facilities that came with her new house: an electric stove, a fridge, dishwasher and washing machine. And although the house is small - there are bunk beds for the adults, as well as a cot for the baby - it is a big step up from living in the damaged basement of her former house, a situation she had endured for months.<br/>\"We didn't know how to live,\" she says. Even now, life remains very hard. Every day, through the window of her modular house, Mrs Pylypenko sees the charred remnants of her old Ukrainian villa - a tattered ruin that was once her home.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Hemlock, however, is far from our only green neighbour that poses a risk.<br/>The Bucklesham hemlock's days are numbered.<br/>First reported to Suffolk County Council in June by parish council chairman David Brinkley, the authority has pledged to close the road and remove the offending plant.<br/>In his call to action, Mr Brinkley says delays to the plant's removal \"put children's lives at stake\", with them needing to go into the road to avoid it.<br/>Head teacher Rachael Rudge has similar concerns.<br/>\"To walk on the roads because the path isn't safe because of all the hemlock and vegetation overgrowing, they're being put in this really difficult and unsafe position,\" she says.<br/>But according to Prof Iain Barr, of the University of East Anglia, the removal of the hemlock leaves a further 28,000 still dotted around the UK.<br/>Prof Barr, a professor of field ecology, tells the BBC about a number of other dangerous plants sitting in plain sight and why some pose such a threat.<br/>The giant hogweed - Heracleum mantegazzianum - is not to be messed with, says Prof Barr.<br/>It is one of more than 100 toxic plants found in the UK and listed as potentially harmful by the Royal Horticultural Society.<br/>\"If you touch it and your body reacts to it, it can cause a reaction and makes you very susceptible to sunburn,\" Prof Barr says. \"You don't want to come into contact with any part of it.\"<br/>The toxic sap of the plant, which grows near canals and rivers, can cause burns, blisters and scarring to those who touch it.<br/>The plant, a close relative of cow parsley, has white flowers, thick bristly stems and can grow more than 16ft (5m) tall. <br/>Native to Central Asia, it was introduced into Britain in 1893 as an ornamental plant, but \"escaped from domestication\".<br/>Toxic components in the leaves, stems, roots, flowers and seeds can be transferred to skin by touch. <br/>It is often confused with its native relative, the common hogweed.<br/>\"That's also toxic,\" says Prof Barr. \"But less so.\"<br/>A staple favourite for a shadier spot in the garden, the much-loved foxglove's floral beauty comes with a dark side.<br/>Foxglove - digitalis - is a source of digitoxin, a glycoside in the drug digitalis, which has been used as a heart stimulant since 1785. <br/>It is also well-known for its toxicity in all parts of the plant. <br/>Consuming the leaves can cause oral and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. <br/>In severe cases, symptoms can include visual disturbances, plus heart and kidney problems.<br/>\"People should just stand back and admire it,\" says Prof Barr. <br/>\"Don't eat it,\" says Prof Barr.<br/>Deadly nightshade is one of the UK's most poisonous plants and just a couple of berries, which contain tropane alkaloids, would be enough to kill a person. <br/>\"It is part of the tomato family,\" says Prof Barr. \"It can be found in woodlands, though it is not quite as common as it used to be.\"<br/>The Solanaceae family is a vast one with more than 2,500 members including tomatoes, potatoes, chillies, aubergines, peppers, tobacco, deadly nightshade and henbane.<br/>Despite its deadly potential, the nerve-gas antidote atropine sulphate can be extracted from it.<br/>\"The hemlock water dropwort is very, very common around the [Norfolk and Suffolk] Broads,\" says Prof Barr. \"It is also very toxic.\"<br/>Also known as the \"poison parsnip\", hemlock water dropwort - Oenanthe crocata - is one of the most poisonous plants native to the UK.<br/>Both hemlock and hemlock water dropwort are part of the carrot family, but live in different habitats and have different toxins.<br/>The tubers, stems and leaves all contain a poisonous and powerful convulsant called oenanthotoxin, which targets the central nervous system.<br/>Hemlock on the other hand contains five alkaloids - coniine, conhydrine, pseudoconhydrine, methyl-coniine and ethyl-piperidine - which cause violent vomiting and paralysis of the nervous system.<br/>Toxic plant related deaths are very rare in the UK - but they do happen. The Office for National Statistics found six people died from the \"toxic effect of ingested plants\" in 2016..<br/>But how do plants become so toxic that they can kill people?<br/>\"It is all to do with chemistry and evolution,\" says Dr Barr. \"Plants have developed toxins to avoid being eaten.<br/>\"So a plant that is slightly more toxic to a grazing animal than the ones next to it has a slight advantage.<br/>\"Over time, this process leads to a point where certain plants can become very toxic to certain species.\"<br/>The majority of the UK's native toxic plants evolved their toxins to deter huge creatures like woolly mammoths or 2m (6ft 6in) tall aurochs, rather than us humans, he said.<br/>\"If an aurochs or mammoth overgrazed, then the plant alkaloids would make it not feel very well,\" he says. <br/>\"It was not designed to kill them, just to make them unwell and to stop eating.\"<br/>Plant toxins certainly did not develop, he says, to prevent children from walking to school.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The compound is isolated, secure and private. <br/>Part training-hub, part medical facility, part re-education centre, this is where North Korean defectors are sent for three months when they arrive in South Korea.<br/>Its name is Hanawon, or to give it its full title, the Settlement Support Centre for North Korean Refugees.<br/>The number of North Koreans making the difficult and dangerous journey to South Korea - risking possible death if they are caught - to escape poverty and repression has fallen significantly in recent years.<br/>A decade or so ago, nearly 3,000 arrived each year. That figure dropped to around 1,000 in the years that followed and then to below 100 during the pandemic, when North Korea sealed its borders.<br/>Despite that, South Korea has reaffirmed its commitment not just to keeping Hanawon open, but to expanding its facilities.<br/>The government in Seoul believes that as Covid controls are relaxed in North Korea, more of its people will be able to flee. If that happens, Hanawon will again fill up.<br/>Unification Minister Kwon Young-se said South Korea needs to prepare to greet these new arrivals.<br/>\"We need to think of defectors not as aliens, but as neighbours whose hometown is in the North,\" he said.<br/>With its hedges, flowers and manicured trees, Hanawon appeared welcoming in the summer sun on Monday, when the South Korean government gave journalists a rare glimpse inside the facility.<br/>We were shown around a training centre, where North Korea defectors are offered 22 courses, in subjects such as hair and beauty, baking and clothes making.<br/>One room has been made to look like a nail parlour, where defectors learn the delicate art of the manicure. They use model hands to practice painting, polishing and filing.<br/>The delicious smell of baking fills the air; it has drifted down from a cookery class next-door.<br/>Other courses are aimed at helping the North Koreans adjust to life in a country that is, in terms of technology, decades ahead of where they came from.<br/>One classroom is set up like a shop selling high-tech gadgets. Tablets, smartphones and computers have been put on display.<br/>While the floor of another building looks like a modern hospital. There is a small ward, consulting rooms and doctors walking around in white medical coats.<br/>It is not just the physical needs of the North Koreans that are catered for; many arrive with severe psychological problems that need urgent attention. <br/>Dr Jeon Jin-yong is a psychiatrist who has worked at Hanawon. He has heard terrible tales of trauma from North Koreans who have passed through the facility.<br/>He said they have had to cope with the stress of escape, and the constant fear that they will be caught and sent back before they make it to South Korea.<br/>Many struggle to overcome the guilt of leaving relatives behind in North Korea who they might never see again.<br/>Some face prejudice in South Korea and so choose to hide the fact that they are from the North.<br/>\"One of my patients was once having lunch in a restaurant when on the television there was news about North Korea launching a missile,\" said Dr Jeon.<br/>\"He became very uncomfortable, so quickly finished eating and left the restaurant. He was worried about what people would think if they knew he was from the North.\"<br/>In an interview with journalists, three female defectors currently at Hanawon gave a hint of the difficulties they are trying to overcome.<br/>They were fearful of revealing their names and were introduced as A, B and C. One woman spoke from behind a screen.<br/>All three had arrived in South Korea after first escaping to China, where their lives were better than in North Korea - but still full of anxiety and danger.<br/>Woman B said she was unable to get a Chinese identity card, which meant she could not go to a hospital, get a bank card or even travel on a train.<br/>Woman C said she was paid half the wages of a Chinese worker because she was in no position to argue for more.<br/>They also described a tightening net of Chinese surveillance that had forced them to seek shelter in South Korea.<br/>\"When I first decided to defect I wasn't afraid of anything because I was all alone,\" said woman A. \"But then I had a child in China and realised I had no legal status.\"<br/>All three women spoke of their hopes - and trepidation - for the future. One of them said she was even worried about paying tax.<br/>Someone who knows what they are going through is Kim Sung-hui, who graduated from Hanawon just over a decade ago and now runs her own business making a rice wine that's popular in North Korea.<br/>In North Korea, Mrs Kim had been told that the South Koreans would initially welcome her - and then she would be tortured and killed.<br/>\"It wasn't until I graduated from Hanawon that I finally realised that I was safe,\" she said.<br/>Mrs Kim said the real education for those at Hanawon would begin only after leaving the facility.<br/>\"The first night on the outside is a memorable one for all defectors. I felt such relief that I was finally in South Korea. I hugged my daughter and started to cry - not because I was sad or lonely - but because we'd survived,\" the 49-year-old said.<br/>In those first few weeks on the outside, Mrs Kim remembers the kindness of South Korean volunteers who helped her adjust.<br/>They were there to welcome her when she stepped into her new home, they showed her around the local shops and even paid for her first ride in a taxi.

The law says they cannot consent to taking part in \"indecent photographs\".<br/>If the mother's account to the Sun is true, you don't need to be a lawyer to see the potential for a criminal investigation.<br/>The maximum sentence for a crime under the Protection of Children Act 1978 is 10 years. In practice, most sentences are far shorter because each case comes down to the specific facts of the case. <br/>The law protects journalists so they can unmask \"the fraudulent and the scandalous\", to quote one famous case.<br/>But in practice, doing so is a complicated newsroom equation that criss-crosses between editorial ethics and the law.<br/>Here's the problem: this story is more questions than answers.<br/>The Sun says it has seen \"evidence\" that supports the concerns of the parents.<br/>But on Monday night lawyers representing the young person said the mother's account was \"rubbish\" and the newspaper's reporting \"totally wrong\".  <br/>Then the mother told the newspaper she stood by her claims. <br/>And it's in this claim and counter-claim space that the law bites.<br/>The first is a right to privacy. <br/>The law recognises that every one of us has a \"reasonable expectation\" of privacy. <br/>Some things in our lives are nobody else's business, unless there is an over-riding public interest in revealing them. <br/>In the Sun's latest story, published on Monday night, the young person's step father is quoted as saying police had told him that whatever had happened \"wasn't illegal\". We don't know exactly which police this relates to and whether it was a formal decision not to investigate. <br/>So if journalists don't have hard evidence of wrongdoing by the BBC presenter, what is the case for breaching their privacy? <br/>Since a major Supreme Court ruling in 2022, that right to privacy includes people who are under investigation by a law enforcement agency - meaning the stage before they have been formally charged with a crime and sent to the courts.<br/>The complications don't end there. Lawyers for the young person have said their client too is suffering an invasion of privacy. <br/>And if they are right about that, their client could try to sue if they were named. <br/>The second challenge is the separate law of defamation. This protects any individual's reputation from the massive harm caused by lies.<br/>Anyone speculating on social media about the identity of the presenter could be sued for causing this harm and find themselves financially ruined.<br/>An innuendo can be just as catastrophic to reputation - as Sally Bercow, wife of the then Speaker of the House of Commons, found out to her cost 10 years ago. <br/>If a news organisation chooses not to name the presenter, they could cause damage to a similar colleague, thanks to a case that leaves bona fide trained journalists with the shivers.<br/>Back in 1986, a newspaper alleged that an unnamed detective in Banbury CID had raped a woman.<br/>The unit was so small other members of the unit sued, saying everyone who knew of them would think they were the guilty party. <br/>Not all claims made against people in the public eye are true. <br/>Sometimes a complainant has an ulterior motive or, sadly, is unwell.<br/>That's not to suggest allegations should be brushed to one side and not taken seriously.<br/>On the contrary. It becomes all the more important to work out the truth.<br/>The Metropolitan Police are now involved.  They have said they are assessing information given to them by the BBC and working to establish \"whether there is evidence of a criminal offence\".<br/>Although they have not yet launched a formal investigation.<br/>So if journalists, like the police, are short of actual facts, the legal risks they face in naming anyone in this story are now huge.<br/>BBC in touch with police over presenter allegations<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The BBC's Russia Editor gets to grips with the latest twist in the Wagner saga.<br/>So, let me get this straight. <br/>On the morning of 24 June, the day of the mutiny, Vladimir Putin accused the Wagner leadership of \"treachery\" and \"a stab in the back\". Later that day, Russian air force pilots were killed, shot down by Wagner fighters.<br/>Then, with the mercenaries just 200km (120 miles) from the Russian capital, the Kremlin and Wagner did a deal. The mutiny was over. No-one was arrested. No-one has been prosecuted.<br/>Not only was Yevgeny Prigozhin not clapped in irons and hauled off to the police station for his rebellion - it's now emerged that five days later he was in the Kremlin, together with his commanders, sitting round the table and chatting with President Putin. <br/>Yet another twist and turn in a story that's already surpassed Dostoyevsky for levels of surprise and mystery.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Where is Yevgeny Prigozhin? And why does it matter?<br/>What we don't know, though, is what exactly was said at that meeting and how it concluded. Judging by what's happened since, this was no \"kiss and make up\". <br/>In recent days, the Russian state media has been working overtime to discredit Mr Prigozhin.<br/>Potentially embarrassing photographs allegedly taken during the raid of his St Petersburg mansion were leaked to social media and Russian TV. They showed gold bars, weapons and - bizarrely - a large collection of wigs. <br/>Last night Russia-1's flagship show, News of the Week, continued the character assassination.<br/>A report about Mr Prigozhin claimed: \"He's not the Robin Hood he tried to pass himself off as. He was a businessman with a criminal past. Many of his projects were dodgy and not always within the law.\"<br/>And what of that deal between the Kremlin and Wagner to end the mutiny on 24 June? According to the agreement, Mr Prigozhin was supposed to leave Russia for Belarus, along with those Wagner fighters who expressed the desire to join him. <br/>Last week the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, told us that the Wagner chief and his mercenaries weren't there. To summarise his point: they might end up in Belarus - but they might not. <br/>So that's all clear then. Not.<br/>Where are Wagner? Where is Mr Prigozhin? What are their plans? What have they agreed with Mr Putin?<br/>I wish I knew. <br/>For now, all I can say is this: stay tuned for the next (inevitably bizarre) episode of Russia: the June Mutiny and the Kremlin. <br/>What is Russia's Wagner mercenary group?<br/>24 hours of mayhem in Russia<br/>Satellite images show activity at Belarus base<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It \"was very serious\", according to director general Tim Davie.<br/>They said they emailed the complainant to ask for more information so they could verify the claims, and carried out checks to verify the identity of the complainant.<br/>The BBC's corporate investigations team had received no reply to the email so tried to call the mobile number provided by the complainant. They said the call didn't connect.<br/>However, the Sun later reported that \"the family say no-one from the corporation rang them for a proper interview after the initial complaint\".<br/>The BBC said no additional attempts to contact the complainant were made after this date, but the case \"remained open\".<br/>The Sun newspaper told the BBC via the corporate press office about allegations concerning a presenter. According to the BBC, the claims made by the Sun contained new allegations, which were different from those received by the investigations team.<br/>The BBC said this was the first time Mr Davie or any executive directors were made aware of the case. They set up an incident management group to lead the response.<br/>A senior manager spoke to the presenter about the allegations. It was agreed that they shouldn't appear on air while the allegations were being investigated, the BBC said.<br/>The Sun's first story was published, about the mother's claims that a BBC presenter paid their child tens of thousands of pounds for explicit photos over three years.<br/>The paper quoted the mother as saying the young person used the money to fund a crack cocaine habit, and that she was worried her child could \"wind up dead\".<br/>The young person sent a WhatsApp message to the paper on this evening denying the claims, saying their mother's statement was \"totally wrong and there was no truth to it\", according to a later letter from their lawyer.<br/>In its first public statement, the BBC said that if it receives information requiring further investigation, steps it takes include \"actively attempting to speak to those who have contacted us in order to seek further detail and understanding of the situation\".<br/>It added: \"If we get no reply to our attempts or receive no further contact that can limit our ability to progress things but it does not mean our enquiries stop. If, at any point, new information comes to light or is provided - including via newspapers - this will be acted upon appropriately, in line with internal processes.\"<br/>The BBC also made contact with the Metropolitan Police regarding the allegations.<br/>The Sun published further allegations, quoting the mother as saying the presenter was pictured in his underwear \"ready for my child to perform for him\".<br/>The BBC said it received some materials from the family member regarding the complaint on this and the following day.<br/>Meanwhile, following speculation about the star's identity on social media, BBC presenters including Gary Lineker, Jeremy Vine, Rylan Clark and Nicky Campbell deny involvement to publicly clear their names.<br/>The BBC said it had suspended a male staff member and was \"working as quickly as possible to establish the facts in order to properly inform appropriate next steps\". <br/>\"It is important that these matters are handled fairly and with care,\" a statement said.<br/>The Metropolitan Police said it had \"received initial contact from the BBC in relation to this matter, but no formal referral or allegation has been made\".<br/>The Sun reported that the presenter allegedly made two calls to the young person and asked them \"what have you done\", and appealed to them to call their mother to \"stop the investigation\".<br/>Representatives from the BBC met detectives from the Met's Specialist Crime Command. The force said it was \"assessing\" information from the BBC, but there was \"no investigation at this time\".<br/>In a letter to the BBC, the lawyer representing the young person at the centre of the allegations disputed their mother's account of events, saying \"the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish\".<br/>The letter claimed the young person sent the newspaper a denial on Friday, but that it proceeded to publish \"their inappropriate article\".<br/>In response, the Sun said it \"reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child\".<br/>Their complaint \"was not acted upon by the BBC\" and it had \"seen evidence that supports their concerns\", the Sun added. \"It's now for the BBC to properly investigate.\"<br/>The parents told the Sun they stood by their account. The step-father was quoted as saying the allegations were originally put to the BBC \"for an hour\".<br/>The article also reported that the step-father originally went to police about the matter but was told \"they couldn't do anything as they said it wasn't illegal\".<br/>During a press conference to launch the BBC's annual report, Mr Davie gave more details of the corporation's response. The BBC accepted there were \"lessons to be learned following this exercise\".<br/>The director general said he wanted to examine whether the BBC raises \"red flags quick enough\" when such complaints are made. The BBC's group chief operating officer will assess whether protocols and procedures are appropriate.<br/>The BBC also said the police had asked the corporation to \"pause its investigations into the allegations while they scope future work\".<br/>'Nothing inappropriate' in BBC presenter row - lawyer<br/>Police assessing information on BBC presenter<br/>Family 'upset' with BBC response to presenter claims<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

the Westminster government is sovereign at all times,\" she told the inquiry.<br/>\"And if there is a deficiency in the Northern Ireland administration then those people in Westminster with responsibility for Northern Ireland have a responsibility.\"<br/>She added: \"If there is a gap in resilience in part of the UK, surely that should concern the government of the UK.\"<br/>Baroness Foster used this platform to stress the absence of Westminster politicians in the running of Northern Ireland.  <br/>On several occasions she told the Covid-19 inquiry that the lack of input made Northern Ireland less resilient when the time came to facing a major health emergency.  <br/>Referring to the time as \"realpolitik\", Baroness Foster said in the absence of power sharing the responsibility lay with Westminster to \"step in\". <br/>Baroness Foster highlighted that in October 2016 a report from Professor Rafael Bengoa had recommended changes to the health service in Northern Ireland. <br/>She said that all parties saw this as a \"necessity\" but following the collapse of Stormont in January 2017 this was not implemented. <br/>Last week, Robin Swann, who served as health minister during the pandemic, told the inquiry a lack of reform and investment in the health service hindered its response to the pandemic<br/>Baroness Foster said she was proud of the response of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the health service to the Covid pandemic, especially in the absence of ministers.<br/>However, she added that she was unsure if any amount of planning would have left Northern Ireland \"fit for purpose\" to deal with the Covid pandemic due to its scale and nature. <br/>\"The number one risk on the risk register across the UK was for a flu pandemic and what came towards us was not a flu pandemic but a very transmittable disease in the community,\" she said.<br/>\"Therefore the need to scale up and have the capability to deal with that was something we had to dig very deep into very quickly.\"<br/>Giving his evidence, former permanent secretary at the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, rebutted any suggestion that nothing happened in the absence of Stormont minsters.<br/>He said that \"preparatory work\" continued but any strategic change required ministers in place. <br/>\"In that three-year period there were no issues about the work we were doing in the department as regards the development of our emergency response plan or emergency preparation that had a minister been in place, they would have landed on the ministers desk.\"<br/>The first phase of the inquiry is looking at how prepared the UK and the devolved institutions were for the pandemic.<br/>It plans to hold hearings until at least 2025, but updates and reports will be published by its chair Baroness Hallett as it continues.<br/>On Monday, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride told the inquiry there was \"no doubt\" the absence of ministers had a significant impact on Stormont's preparedness for a pandemic.<br/>He added Brexit also affected pandemic planning, with resources diverted to aid with implementing changes.<br/>There was also a \"very significant\" shortfall in resources and staff to deal with the response required, the chief medical officer said.<br/>Lack of ministers had 'significant' Covid impact<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Failed reforms hindered NI Covid response -

Regular pay fell by 0.8% after the effect of inflation was taken into account.<br/>The latest wage figures were higher than expected and Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said this \"won't ease the Bank of England's inflation fears significantly\".<br/>Last month, the Bank of England raised interest rates by more than expected, lifting its key rate to 5% from 4.5%. <br/>Mr Webb said that while he expected the Bank to push rates to 5.25% at its next meeting in August, he added \"we can't rule out\" an increase to 5.5%, saying \"much will depend\" on next week's inflation figure.<br/>Deutsche Bank said that an increase in rates to 5.5% next month \"now looks more likely than not\".<br/>Forecasts of more rate rises by the Bank have helped to push mortgage costs to their highest level for 15 years.<br/>In January, when the UK's inflation rate was above 10%, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to halve it by the end of the year.<br/>Mel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told the BBC's Today programme that while forecasts still suggest that would happen, \"it is not going to be easy\".<br/>The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also showed:<br/>There are indications that what is called \"tightness\" in the labour market - where there are too few workers to fit the jobs available - is starting to ease.<br/>However, business groups have continued to stress the difficulty of finding the right workers, despite the slight rise in unemployment and fewer vacancies.<br/>The government is now offering all workers a \"Midlife MOT\" on their careers to help those in their mid-40s and above to retrain.<br/>The ONS data showed that pay rises were highest for those in better paid sectors such as finance, and were lower in retail.<br/>The most up-to-date figures for just the month of May seem to show wage rises beginning to slow. This raises the possibility that pay increases have now peaked, which could lead to a calmer path for inflation.<br/>Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said that while wage costs remain \"very acute\" for companies there were some \"hopeful signs\" in the latest ONS figures, \"with the number of vacancies falling and more people coming out of inactivity back into the labour market\".<br/>The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \"Our jobs market is strong with unemployment low by historical standards. But we still have around one million job vacancies, pushing up inflation even further.\"<br/>Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures were \"another dismal reflection of the Tories' mismanagement of the economy\".<br/>\"Britain is the only G7 country with a lower employment rate than before the pandemic and real wages have fallen yet again,\" he added.<br/>Read more tips here<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>How much are prices rising for you?

Such a condition would make them inadmissible in most states, but Michigan law allows for handwritten wills as long as they meet other criteria.<br/>Theodore White II - Franklin's third child, from her brief marriage to her former manager - argues that the notarised 11-page document from 2010 is the valid will.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Aretha Franklin: In her own words<br/>That version lists him as a co-executor or personal representative to the estate, along with Ms Owens, the niece. It also calls for Kecalf and Edward Franklin, the singer's second and fourth sons, to \"take business classes and get a certificate or a degree\" if they wish to benefit from the estate.<br/>Meanwhile, Kecalf and Edward argue that the 2014 version is their mother's primary will.<br/>Kecalf replaces his brother as a co-executor in the four-page document. He and his grandchildren would also inherit his mother's $1.2m (\u00a3934,000) gated mansion - a home described by Edward's attorney as \"the crown jewel\".<br/>The newer document also stipulates that Franklin's gowns either be auctioned or handed over to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington.<br/>Clarence Franklin, the eldest child, is not involved in the dispute. He lives in an assisted living facility in Michigan and is under a legal guardianship.<br/>A lawyer for his guardian told the BBC they will not participate in the trial and \"have reached a settlement that gives Clarence a percentage of the estate without regard to the outcome of the will contest\".<br/>The family rift had earlier driven Ms Owens to quit as representative of her aunt's estate.<br/>\"Given my aunt's love of family and desire for privacy, this is not what she would have wanted for us, nor is it what I want,\" she wrote in a 2020 court filing. <br/>\"I love my cousins, hold no animosity towards them, and wish them the best.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Fans pay their respects to Aretha Franklin in Detroit<br/>Earlier this year, the court in Pontiac, Michigan, heard three voicemail messages, recorded in the months before Franklin died, in which she discusses another will she was preparing with an estate lawyer. <br/>In the messages, Franklin is heard expressing certain \"firm intentions\" from a Detroit hospital bed, but attorney Henry Grix testified he believed she \"hadn't made up her mind\" about her final wishes.<br/>The judge has excluded that document from consideration in the trial.<br/>The Franklin fortune was estimated at $80m when the star died in 2018, but more recent valuations and several years of unpaid taxes have vastly reduced that number.<br/>According to an inventory filed in court, and seen by the BBC, the late singer's assets are valued at just under $6m.<br/>Nicholas Papasifakis, who currently serves as Franklin's personal representative, said he is not participating in the trial and is not taking a side in the dispute.<br/>\"Once there has been a determination by the Court as to the disposition of Ms Franklin's Estate,\" he wrote in an email, \"I will follow that determination in distributing Ms Franklin's assets.\"<br/>Aretha Franklin: Three wills discovered<br/>Aretha Franklin wins posthumous Pulitzer<br/>'Aretha Franklin's music is everywhere you turn'<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The offence comes under Hong Kong's draconian security law which was imposed three years ago after widespread pro-democracy protests took place in the former British territory in 2019.<br/>Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee told a media briefing on Tuesday that investigations against activists would intensify as Hong Kong authorities seek to \"pursue them for life\".<br/>\"We will exhaust all means to pursue them... We will also pursue the forces behind the scenes that support and perhaps even control them.<br/>\"As I have said, we should treat them as 'rats on the streets' and avoid them,\" he said, repeating earlier comments. <br/>Last week, Mr Lee urged the activists to give themselves up, adding that otherwise they would spend their days in fear.<br/>The countries in which the activists live - the UK, the US and Australia - do not have extradition treaties with China, and have condemned the order from Hong Kong authorities.<br/>However, at least five people with connections to the activists have been arrested in Hong Kong since the announcement. The police said they \"do not rule out the possibility that more arrests will be made\".<br/>Mr Law told the BBC last week he would have to be more careful following the order.<br/>He is one of the most prominent figures in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, and was one of the unofficial leaders of the 2019 demonstrations.<br/>After fleeing Hong Kong in 2020, he had issued a statement saying he had cut off all ties with his family.<br/>He told the BBC last week he felt his situation was \"relatively safe\" in the UK, but he would have to be more vigilant as a result of the bounty's announcement.<br/>\"There could possibly be someone in the UK - or anywhere else - to provide informations of me to (the Hong Kong authorities). For example, my whereabouts, where they could possibly extradite me when I'm transiting in certain countries,\" Mr Law said.<br/>\"All these things may put my life in to dangerous situations if I'm not careful enough of who I meet or where I go.

When it announced the app's launch, the company said it would add a \"more robust search function\" along with improvements to the selection of recommended posts.<br/>Meanwhile the only way currently to fully delete a Threads profile is to delete the associated Instagram account, which many users would be reluctant to - another issue the company is looking to fix.<br/>When Threads was launched, Meta announced it planned to allow it to communicate with other social-media platforms, such as Mastodon, using something known as the fediverse.<br/>But this suggestion while welcomed by some, has met opposition.<br/>The idea of the fediverse is it is like email. Someone on Gmail can exchange emails with someone using Hotmail, for example, and the fediverse could be described as that idea applied to social media.<br/>At some point in the future Meta wants users to be able to use their Threads account to interact with other social-media platforms using ActivityPub - a protocol with the necessary programming code - such as Mastodon, WordPress or Reddit-alternative Lemmy.<br/>But some worry Threads threatens the idea of this system altogether, because of a practice big tech companies have utilised in the past - \"embrace, extend and extinguish\", when a company with a lot of resources extends what is possible from a new technology so drastically it becomes the new standard, leaving people with no choice but to use its platform.<br/>Mastodon chief executive Eugen Rochko dismissed these fears, saying Meta joining Threads was \"validation of the movement towards decentralised social media\" and \"a clear victory for our cause\".<br/>But concern among users has grown with over a hundred Mastodon communities joining what they call the \"fedipact\" - an agreement to block Meta from being able to access their community under any circumstances - so even when Threads does begin to support ActivityPub, users will not be able to access everything on the fediverse.<br/>One other feature coming to Threads at some point may also receive mixed reviews.

At least 160 Palestinians and more than 30 Israelis have been killed since January. <br/>Israel's government said its military operation last week was to stop the camp being a \"refuge\" for armed groups. It said it seized \"hundreds\" of guns and other weapons, including \"advanced\" improvised explosives. <br/>It was its biggest assault in the West Bank in two decades, involving drone strikes into a packed urban area and armoured diggers causing massive destruction. <br/>The United Nations accused Israel of using excessive force, while the Palestinian leadership called it a \"war crime\". <br/>Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht, asked by the BBC last week about the casualties, said: \"There were 12 people killed, every one that was killed was involved directly with terrorism.\"<br/>\"A 17-year-old may be regarded as a minor but he's holding weapons and firing... We can show that evidence. We have pictures of all of them, and intel that they were involved.\" <br/>After his death, Abdul Rahman Hardan was claimed as a member by the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. However, his family has distanced itself from the claim, and Israel has yet to show evidence he posed a threat at the time he was fatally shot. <br/>Under international law, the use of firearms by security forces against civilians is defined as a measure of last resort, and can only take place to stop an \"imminent threat of death or serious injury\".\u202f<br/>Children are also given added protections under international humanitarian law. <br/>Sixteen-year-old Abdul Rahman was killed at 13:00 (10:00 GMT) on Tuesday, as confrontations had continued in the city. Some involved gunmen firing towards Israeli forces.<br/>Others involved Palestinian youths throwing rocks at Israeli jeeps and armoured troop carriers - a frequent occurrence as young men try to repel Israel's military raids into Palestinian cities. <br/>In one video, first verified by the Times newspaper, the teenager can be seen standing in the street next to al-Amal hospital, close to a group of boys or young men. Rocks or other debris appear on the ground in the vicinity. No weapons are visible and Abdul Rahman appears unarmed. <br/>Around 13 seconds into the footage, which has no sound, he leans forward to look down a street next to the hospital. He is then seen falling to the ground, having been shot in the head. <br/>The original source of the video is not known to the BBC, but the boy's family and the eyewitnesses verified it as showing Abdul Rahman being shot. <br/>A second video filmed by a journalist outside the hospital shows the following moments, in which a paramedic rushes to Abdul Rahman and picks him up before carrying him along the street. The boy is suffering a catastrophic bleed from the head as he is carried towards the hospital entrance. <br/>No weapons are visible in the area where the teenager fell nor elsewhere in the footage.<br/>The IDF said it was inconclusive as to whether the footage documented the killing of Abdul Rahman by its forces.<br/>Islamic Jihad - listed by Israel and the West as a terrorist organisation - claimed the 16-year-old as a fighter. Social media pictures later emerged in which he had posed with assault rifles at unknown dates. Such pictures are not uncommon among young men and teenagers in Jenin and surrounding villages. <br/>The refugee camp is a highly militarised environment where the official Palestinian leadership has lost control, and armed groups see themselves as a core of resistance to Israel's military occupation - now into its 57th year. Human rights groups have frequently condemned militant groups putting weapons in the hands of minors. <br/>The teenager's father, Hassan Ahmad Hardan, told the BBC that his son was on his way to the hospital to donate blood when an Israeli military vehicle entered the street. <br/>\"He was standing in the street to cross it when they shot him in the head from the back,\" said Mr Hardan.<br/>\"He did not carry anything with him - no stone, no weapon, nothing,\" he added. <br/>In an interview with the Times, his family also said Abdul Rahman was not a militant and did not belong to any armed group. <br/>Two eyewitnesses also told the BBC the teenager was unarmed.<br/>\"We were standing in one of the streets near the presence of occupation [Israeli] forces. After that, the occupation sniper shot the martyr Abdul Rahman without any reason or justification,\" said one eyewitness, who asked that his name was not published. <br/>\"The martyr was unarmed and did not carry anything,\" he added.  <br/>Of the 12 Palestinians killed in Jenin last week, two were aged 16 and two were 17 years old. Ten of the total were claimed as members by militant groups. <br/>The IDF said it continued to examine the video, asking to receive it in its \"unedited entirety\".<br/>In a statement, a spokesman said: \"As of this time, it is not possible to say with certainty that the video does indeed document the neutralization of Abdul Rahman Hassan by IDF forces.\"<br/>The spokesman said it was \"unfortunate\" that earlier reports \"discounted the Islamic Jihad's claim of responsibility for the neutralized terrorist and his association with the terrorist organization\".<br/>He went on: \"The IDF operated in a densely populated and complex combat zone, where hundreds of armed gunmen fired indiscriminately in the area. The IDF does everything in its power to avoid harming uninvolved individuals and operates precisely against terrorist organisations.\"<br/>Palestinians fear escalation after Jenin assault<br/>Palestinian families return to rubble in Jenin<br/>See inside Jenin refugee camp after Israeli assault<br/>Israeli forces complete withdrawal from Jenin<br/>Israel's Jenin operation reignites Palestinian anger<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

An audit of the Irish organisation's finances found irregularities with what was in the public domain and what the accounts actually showed.<br/>After further reading, the corporation has been accused of running \"a slush fund\" - spending thousands on flip-flops and gig tickets as well as millions on a failed musical, all \"while crying poverty\".<br/>Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said reform of how the institution is funded is well overdue.<br/>Unlike the BBC, the Irish broadcaster is funded using advertising revenue as well as a licence fee, and the scandal has dented the trust its audience has in it.<br/>\"RT\u00c9 has such a big place in Irish society, so this scandal was always going to be big news,\" freelance entertainment reporter Emma Kelly tells BBC News.<br/>\"The Late Late Show in particular is such a cultural touchstone, so when people find out that RT\u00c9 and Ryan Tubridy haven't been fully transparent, it's going to hurt.\" <br/>The programme Tubridy presented until recently is not only an Irish institution - with a packed live audience for more than two hours each Friday night - but is the longest-running late-night talk show in Europe. The format smoothly flips between light entertainment interviews to serious society debate, with pop stars performing in the studio as well.<br/>\"The whole thing feel feels like a betrayal,\" Kelly explains. \"The more ridiculous details that emerge or big names that get dragged in, the harder it is to look away.\"<br/>Tuesday will be the first time Tubridy has spoken publicly since the scandal was first reported. He'll appear with his agent Noel Kelly for hours of questioning.<br/>Before the controversy was made public, the 50-year-old stood down as host of The Late Late Show after nearly 14 years, to be replaced by Patrick Kielty.<br/>On Monday, former BBC News executive Kevin Bakhurst took over as director general and promptly stood down the entire executive board.<br/>He wrote in an email to staff: \"Change will be essential if we are to rebuild trust in public service broadcasting in Ireland and in RT\u00c9.\"<br/>RT\u00c9 board stood down by new director general<br/>Your questions on RT\u00c9's payment scandal answered<br/>New RT\u00c9 boss vows to 'restore trust' with public<br/>RT\u00c9 spent \u20ac5,000 on flip-flops<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.<br/>Interest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.<br/>The typical mortgage term is 25 years, but 30 and even 40-year terms are now available.<br/>\"Extending the term can help reduce the monthly payment but can cost tens of thousands of pounds more in interest over the life of the mortgage,\" says David Hollingworth.<br/>\"Make sure that you regularly review whether you could cut the term back again as your circumstances change.\"<br/>From listing with a short-term letting site like AirBnB, renting out your parking space with an app like Just Park, or taking in a lodger or overseas student, there are several options to make a bit of cash. <br/>\"Under the government's rent-a-room scheme you will get a tax free allowance of \u00a37,500 per year for income generated from your main home too,\" says Richard Dana.<br/>How will the latest interest rate rise affect you?

However, it is more a question of whether people can afford higher repayments.<br/>An agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage without a new affordability test when their current deal ends, as long as they are up to date with payments.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice.

For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.<br/>Interest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.<br/>There are plenty of ways to try to keep mortgage repayments down when it comes to signing up for the next fixed-rate deal.<br/>That might include using savings to pay down some of the total amount borrowed. Savings could also be put into a linked offset savings account, in which you only pay interest on the mortgage amount, minus the amount you've saved.<br/>Some borrowers want to extend the length of the mortgage term, although that would mean paying more in total, for longer.<br/>A broker can guide you through the different options.<br/>A shortfall equivalent to two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears.<br/>But your lender must make reasonable attempts to reach an agreement with you.<br/>In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates mortgage lenders, has said they must treat customers fairly.<br/>Crucially, customers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they are going to struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must be on hand to help.<br/>Within 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must:<br/>Your lender must then treat you fairly by considering any requests about changing how you pay, perhaps with lower repayments for a short period.<br/>Any arrangement you come to, the FCA points out, will be reflected on your credit file - affecting your ability to borrow money in the future - as will any missed payments.<br/>Your lender might also suggest or allow you to extend the term of the mortgage or let you pay just the interest for a certain period of time.<br/>A mortgage payment holiday enables customers to delay repayments - but not indefinitely.<br/>Lenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances - and not to those already in arrears - but the level of support offered during the Covid pandemic has been reduced.<br/>Again, this will show on your credit file. <br/>Some people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it.<br/>Repossessions are far rarer than they used to be.<br/>There are lots of stages before a lender can take such action and the whole process takes about two years.<br/>But if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice.<br/>Governments tend not to get directly involved in support when people face higher mortgage repayments, and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has ruled out introducing major financial aid over fears it would drive the cost of living higher.<br/>For people on qualifying benefits, Support for Mortgage Interest is available across the UK. The government pays some of your mortgage interest payments, but only in the form of a loan (which has its own interest rate).<br/>Borrowers tend to pay off the loan when they sell the property, or when they die.<br/>There are various conditions and requirements that need to be considered before signing up.<br/>The devolved governments run some mortgage support schemes, but the criteria can be complex and they tend to be when people are at risk of homelessness.

At the same time, the war in Ukraine meant less was available from Russia, putting further pressure on prices.<br/>The war also reduced the amount of grain available, pushing up global food prices. <br/>This effect was compounded in the UK in February by a shortage of salad and other vegetables, which took food inflation to a 45-year high.<br/>Alcohol prices in restaurants and pubs also rose. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>The Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2%, but the current rate is well above that. <br/>The traditional response to rising inflation is to put up interest rates. <br/>This makes borrowing more expensive, and can mean some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. Some saving rates also increase. <br/>When people have less money to spend, they buy fewer things, reducing the demand for goods and slowing price rises.<br/>Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs, and may cut staff. <br/>In June, the Bank increased interest rates for the 13th time in a row, taking the main rate to 5%. <br/>But when inflation is caused by factors such as global energy prices, action from the Bank of England may not be enough to slow it down. <br/>Many people's pay isn't keeping up with rising prices. <br/>The average weekly salary in the UK, excluding bonuses, was \u00a3607 in May, up from \u00a3604 in April,according to official figures.<br/>But when you take inflation into account, regular pay actually fell by 0.8% in the three months to May, compared with the same period the year before. <br/>Unions say wages should reflect the cost of living and many workers have been striking over pay. <br/>However, the government argues big pay rises could push inflation higher because companies might increase prices as a result. <br/>Lower inflation doesn't mean prices fall. It just means they rise less quickly.<br/>The Bank of England has predicted inflation will drop to 5% by the end of 2023, rather than the 4% it had been anticipating.<br/>Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it was \"crucial that we see the job through\" and get price rises back to the 2% target, because people \"should trust that their hard-earned money maintains its value\".<br/>But he admitted that price inflation was being \"more sticky than previously expected\".<br/>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which assesses the government's economic plans, previously predicted inflation would fall back to 2.9% by the end of the year.<br/>In January, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said halving inflation by the end of 2023 was one of the government's five key pledges. <br/>Other countries have also been experiencing a cost-of-living squeeze.<br/>Many of the reasons are the same - increased energy costs, shortages of goods and materials and the fallout from Covid.<br/>The annual inflation rate for countries which use the euro was estimated to be 6.1% in May, down from 7% in April.<br/>The European Central Bank has also been increasing interest rates to try to bring eurozone inflation down. Its benchmark rate is now 4%, the highest level for 22 years.<br/>Inflation has also dropped back in the US. It was 4% in the 12 months to May, down from 4.9% in April, the 11th consecutive monthly fall. <br/>The US central bank has increased its key interest rate to between 5% and 5.25%, up from near 0% a year ago - and the highest level since 2007. <br/>However, it left rates unchanged in June, saying it wanted to assess the impact of the previous rises.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

So if you booked a return flight and the outbound leg is cancelled, you can get the full cost of the return ticket refunded. <br/>If you still want to travel, your airline must find you an alternative flight. If another airline is flying to your destination significantly sooner, or there are other suitable modes of transport available, then you have a right to be booked onto that alternative transport instead. <br/>If you are stuck abroad or at the airport because of a flight cancellation, airlines must also provide you with other assistance until you are able to fly to your destination. <br/>This includes: <br/>If your airline is unable to arrange assistance, you have the right to organise this yourself and claim back the cost later. In this case, the Civil Aviation Authority advises people to keep receipts and not spend more than necessary. <br/>You are entitled to the same assistance if your flight is delayed by more than two hours. <br/>You may also be able to claim compensation if your flight arrives at its destination more than three hours late. Again, the amount is based on how far you are flying. <br/>If you are delayed by more than five hours and no longer want to travel, you can get a full refund.<br/>Disruption caused by things like airport or air traffic control employee strikes, bad weather or other \"extraordinary circumstances\" are not eligible for extra compensation.<br/>However, in other circumstances - which are the airline's fault - you have a number of rights under UK law if you are flying from a UK airport on any airline, arriving at a UK airport on an EU or UK airline, or arriving at an airport in the EU on a UK airline. <br/>What you are entitled to depends on what caused the cancellation and how much notice you were given. <br/>If your flight is cancelled with less than two weeks' notice, you may be able to claim compensation based on the timings of the alternative flight you are offered.<br/>The amount you are entitled to also depends on how far you were travelling. For example: <br/>If you booked a package holiday with a company that is an Abta member and your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a suitable alternative flight or a full refund. <br/>Easyjet cancels 1,700 flights from July to September<br/>Strike action could hit holiday flights in Europe<br/>Closed Ukraine airspace may delay flights next summer<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

List all the pros of what you've done,\" says Shan Saba, a director at Glasgow-based recruitment firm Brightwork.<br/>This evidence also helps your manager rationalise why you should be paid more, according to Stephanie Davies, a workplace psychologist.<br/>\"The brain needs a 'why' - why should I pay you this amount?\" she says.<br/>However, it's not just about bringing a list of all the things you've done. You should also be clear about what you want to do next, says Mr Saba.<br/>\"If you have aspirations of moving up through your organisation, have a plan of what you're looking to do over the coming year.\"<br/>When asking your boss for more money, it helps if you're confident and know your worth.<br/>That's something Ms Begum has noticed, from her experience of having these talks with staff.<br/>\"Here in Salisbury, it's quite difficult to get the staff we need,\" she says.<br/>\"It's also become harder to recruit from overseas. So workers have negotiating power because they know there's a shortage.\"<br/>Often people don't feel confident because there is a \"stigma\" around talking about pay, says Glassdoor's Jill Cotton, but it's \"an important part of work\".<br/>Women and people from minority backgrounds can often find it particularly hard to ask for more more, adds psychologist Stephanie Davies.<br/>Her advice to them is to ask for a mentor or role model, who can help guide them through those conversations.<br/>Most experts agree it's best to have an exact figure in mind before embarking on a conversation about pay.<br/>Do your research, advises James Reed, chair of recruitment firm Reed.<br/>\"You can go online and look at job adverts and see what other comparable jobs are being recruited for and what the salaries are,\" he says.<br/>Ms Cotton warns the figure should be realistic.<br/>\"We would all love to be paid millions of pounds every single year. But we are being paid to fulfil a role with the skillset we have,\" she says.<br/>If the above steps don't result in a pay rise, try not to be disheartened.<br/>\"Sometimes these conversations can take a while, even months, but it's important to keep the communication open,\" says Ms Begum.<br/>Pay is also not the be-all and end-all, says Mr Reed.<br/>\"It's not just necessarily about money. You might be able to get more holiday or more flexibility around working hours,\" he says, adding you could also negotiate extra training and development.<br/>And if you don't feel you're getting what you want from your employer, remember, there are other opportunities out there.<br/>\"You can always look elsewhere, that's the really big lesson,\" says Ms Davies.<br/>Pay rises at fastest pace for over 20 years<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>Strike dates: What do junior doctors and teachers want?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But there are about 10 million people out of work. <br/>It may feel daunting to try and find a job at first so we spoke to some career experts to give you some tips.<br/>There have been a lot of shifts in the workplace in recent years. Hybrid and flexible working means your job search can stretch a bit further, quite literally. <br/>Yvonne Smyth, group head of diversity and inclusion at Hays Recruitment says \"Proximity isn't as important as used to be, so if you're looking for a job, search far and wide in terms of geography. <br/>\"Also if you want to work part-time or say four days a week, don't let full-time positions put you off applying,\" she says.<br/>\"Businesses are more flexible than you might think and if you're the right candidate that can get the job done in fewer days it makes sense for them to adapt the role.\"<br/>Ms Smyth also says it's important to use key words when you're searching online.<br/>\"For example if there's a key skill or industry like sales or retail that you're interested in, you want the algorithms on search platforms to pick up on them. <br/>\"So daily searches on these words are important, so it identifies what you're interested in. <br/>\"Engagement as well is key and that means clicking on jobs with the job titles or a company that you're keen on so the platform yields more of the same.\"<br/>Not all jobs are made public. It's always worth sending an email or having a chat with a manager at a business that you like the look of, as you never know when an opening might be coming up. <br/>Many businesses want to avoid the cost of advertising a job formally and may rely on word of mouth. <br/>Miranda Kyte, a career trends expert at Glassdoor says: \"Another route is to utilise your network, let friends, ex-colleagues, family know that you're looking for a new position.<br/>\"They may be able to check internal job boards for open roles at their own companies and refer you or they could know someone else who can help.\"<br/>Lots of places still ask for a CV and a covering letter when you're applying for a job. <br/>But now you can advertise yourself rather visibly via social media sites like Linkedin which showcase your skills and experience. <br/>Other platforms like Twitter and Instagram can prove useful when touting yourself out to potential employers as well. <br/>Yvonne Smyth from Hays says it's important to focus on skills.<br/>\"Lots of people look at the years required on a job description but actually it's more important that a candidate has the right skills. Try to look for parallels and make that obvious in your application.\" <br/>It can be a little disheartening if the jobs you want require specific very specific qualifications. It may be worth having a look at if there are any ways of picking up the experience or training that you need to land a job while you're on the hunt. <br/>Miranda Kyte from Glassdoor says: \"Lots of courses these days are free and you can do them online. Volunteering is also a great way of filling gaps on your CV or asking to do some work shadowing in companies you'd like to work for.\"<br/>It's easy to get disheartened if you are knocked back after interviews time and time again, or you don't feel like you're getting through the door in the first place. <br/>Our career experts say it's good to review how you're going about your search from time to time and try different approaches. <br/>Career influencer, Mehar Sindhu Batra, says it's quite useful to set personal targets, like a tracker of the number of jobs to apply for in a week or a certain number of cold emails. <br/>She's a big believer in acknowledging the little wins along the way to keep your spirits up. <br/>\"Maybe you landed an interview, received positive feedback on your resume or cover letter, or connected with a helpful contact. Celebrating these wins can boost your confidence and keep you motivated\".<br/>Six tips for getting a job if you're over 50<br/>Five tips when asking for a pay rise<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

A decision is now expected in 2026, after the next general election.<br/>At a cost of \u00a3105bn, the state pension accounts for just under half the total amount the government spends on benefits. <br/>Under the triple lock system, the state pension increases each April in line with whichever of these three measures is highest:<br/>The triple lock was introduced by the Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government in 2010. <br/>It was designed to ensure the value of the state pension was not overtaken by the increase in the cost of living or the working population's income. <br/>The triple lock was temporarily suspended after the Covid pandemic distorted average wage figures, but it has since been restored. <br/>If they have no other source of income, those above retirement age may also be entitled to Pension Credit in addition to the basic state pension. <br/>Like the state pension, this benefit will also increase by 10.1% from April.<br/>If you get Pension Credit, you may also be entitled to other financial support, including housing benefit, a reduction in council tax, or help with your heating costs through the Warm Home Discount Scheme.<br/>People born before 26 September 1956 are also entitled to the annual winter fuel payment. <br/>In the budget, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced various changes to private pension allowances, to help encourage older people to stay in work, or return after retirement. <br/>The lifetime pension allowance is the maximum amount of pension savings an individual can build up over their career without having to pay additional tax. The current \u00a31,073,100 limit was due to remain fixed until 2026.<br/>Ahead of the budget in March, there had been speculation it would be increased to \u00a31.8m, but instead any limit is being scrapped.<br/>The charge will be removed from 6 April 2023, before the allowance is fully abolished from April 2024.<br/>The current allowance applies to private pensions - both defined benefit and defined contribution.<br/>The annual pension allowance is the maximum amount of money an individual can pay into their private pension each tax year without penalty. It is currently \u00a340,000.<br/>Mr Hunt said this will increase by 50%, to \u00a360,000, from 6 April.<br/>If someone goes over the allowance, additional tax charges will apply.<br/>The money purchase annual allowance is also changing. <br/>This applies to those people who have started drawing some of their defined contribution pension, but who want to continue to work and save more.<br/>The allowance is currently \u00a34,000 a year before a tax penalty is triggered, but Mr Hunt is more than doubling that to \u00a310,000 from 6 April.<br/>The lifetime and annual pension allowances have both been cut since 2010, raising about \u00a38bn of extra taxes for the government, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). <br/>The chancellor said removing the lifetime pension allowance would help keep senior doctors in the NHS, and would stop other professionals from retiring early.<br/>But he could not say how many staff would continue working as a result. <br/>Abolishing the lifetime allowance is expected to cost the government about \u00a3800m a year from 2025-26, while increasing the annual allowance will cost about \u00a3300m a year.<br/>The OBR - the government's independent economic forecaster - have calculated both measures would increase employment by 15,000 workers. <br/>But in its assessment of the budget, the IFS called that estimate \"optimistic\", and said the changes were unlikely to play a big part in increasing the number of people in work.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

And it is not just training camps where supplies are low.<br/>\"We have enough fighting spirit to win, of course. Unfortunately, we currently do not have enough weapons,\" Roman, their commander, tells me. \"The main thing is to have enough ammunition.\"<br/>Out on the front lines they are having to economise, he explains. \"This is not a secret. The amount of ammunition that the enemy uses daily is at least five times higher than the amount of ammunition that we use.\"<br/>Supplies from allies have been essential for Ukraine in this war. For Roman and other soldiers, the Nato summit in Vilnius is a crucial moment to ensure they have what they need to continue the fight.<br/>The widespread expectation is that new weapons will be promised at the summit, as well as more supplies of ammunition. The US decision to provide cluster munitions from existing stockpiles last week was partly to act as a stop-gap before new artillery supplies are ready. <br/>But viewed from Ukraine the summit is about much more than just weapons and ammunition - it is about what type of commitment the country will be offered when it comes to joining the alliance.<br/>Ukraine has been knocking at Nato's door for years. What it wants is more than just positive noises and a feeling of being left in a permanent waiting room.<br/>At the core of Nato is Article 5, which sets out that an attack on one member is an attack on all. This principle of collective defence could offer protection for Ukraine, but - almost everyone agrees - is very difficult to put in place when a country is already at war. <br/>\"We believe that it is long overdue to invite Ukraine to Nato,\" Oleg Nikolenko, a spokesperson for Ukraine's foreign affairs minister, says. <br/>\"An invitation to join Nato does not mean an immediate membership in Nato. We are cognizant of the fact that as long as the war goes on, Ukraine won't be able to join Nato. But we are talking about the invitation and setting the clear timeframe for this to happen.\"<br/>The 2008 Nato summit in Bucharest casts a long shadow. Ukraine, along with Georgia, was told membership was on the cards in the future - but with no clear path and no expectation that it would be anytime soon. <br/>That angered Russia but without offering any protection in return. Georgia was attacked in 2008 by Russia, and Ukraine attacked too - first in 2014 and then in 2022. Many of those US officials involved in the decision in Bucharest now acknowledge it was a mistake.<br/>This time Ukraine wants greater clarity and concrete assurances. The exact nature and timetable of any commitment could have real consequences for the war. For instance, offering membership only when the war is over might encourage Russia to maintain a low level conflict to stall membership, some analysts argue. <br/>But there are existing Nato members who are cautious about offering too much to Ukraine now. They fear this could draw Nato closer to war with Russia. <br/>That is a view that is met with some annoyance in Ukraine.<br/>\"Let's be honest: for a long time, Nato has been paying too much attention to whether Russia will allow them to do anything,\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the office of the President of Ukraine, told me when I visited his heavily guarded office in the centre of the capital. <br/>\"Nato must say unequivocally that there are no more preconditions for this related to Russian threats.\"<br/>Ukrainians view membership as a way to end the war by deterring Russia rather than escalating it. They acknowledge, as US President Joe Biden has made clear in recent days, that Ukraine needs to make the reforms that any prospective member has to undertake. <br/>But they argue that Nato was set up to confront Moscow in the Cold War and yet it is now Ukraine which is effectively fighting on Nato's behalf, defending its eastern flank against Russia with its soldiers and civilians dying every day. <br/>For many in Kyiv, the focus by some inside the alliance on the risks of an invitation are a mistake. What, they ask, are the risks of not acting? <br/>In public, Ukrainian officials are careful to sound optimistic and not to enter into any discussion of the consequences if they receive only vague promises and looser \"security guarantees\". They do not want to sound ungrateful for the weapons and ammunition they still need right now. <br/>But privately officials worry that in the long term a failure to bring Ukraine into closer alignment with the West will be used by Moscow to push a narrative within the country that Ukraine has been let down and the West cannot be trusted. People could feel betrayed, one senior official told me.<br/>Without formal membership, the fear is the West could tire of supplying the weapons and ammunition Ukraine needs as the war grinds on. That is something Vladimir Putin and Russia is counting on. <br/>So in Kyiv do they worry about that? <br/>\"I have a counter question: what does it mean to be tired of supporting Ukraine?\" presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak remarks when I put that question to him. <br/>\"This means that democracy does not know how to defend itself.

The EU and US have also designated the PKK as a terrorist group.<br/>Like any of Nato's 31 member countries, Turkey has the power to block new nations from joining the group.<br/>The outcome of crunch talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is being seen as a major win for Sweden's right-wing Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. <br/>While Sweden's initial application to join Nato was made by Mr Kristersson's Social Democrat predecessor, Magdalena Andersson, he has made securing membership a key foreign policy priority since taking over as Swedish leader in October.<br/>He told Sweden's public TV network SVT that he and his team had \"worked very hard\" to address Turkey's concerns about terrorism, and that an agreement had been reached after being allowed to showcase their efforts.<br/>\"I think we got a chance to also present and show what we have been doing for a long time, and that it is also bearing fruit,\" he said.  \"And I think that together with good support from the work of other countries, all in all, we got it together.\"<br/>Sweden introduced tougher anti-terrorism laws in June, making it illegal to give financial or logistical help to terrorist groups.<br/>At the end of last week, that legislation was put into action for the first time, when a Swedish court jailed a Kurdish man for crimes including attempting to finance terrorism, and told him he would be deported afterwards.<br/>Sweden has also resumed arms exports to Turkey.<br/>\"We have taken seriously their very legitimate demand that every country that enters the alliance should contribute to additional security,\" the prime minister told SVT.<br/>After being photographed beaming in Vilnius on Monday, Mr Kristersson admitted on Swedish public radio that he had enjoyed a quick celebratory beer \"with the whole gang\" in a conference room after the talks.<br/>This is also a major win for Turkey. <br/>As well as having Ankara's security concerns addressed, Sweden has promised actively to support Turkey's efforts to join the European Union, and \"step up economic co-operation\".<br/>The entire process has given President Erdogan a huge platform on the global political stage, and plenty of questions remain about what kind of assurances may have been given behind closed doors.<br/>Now that Turkey has ended its opposition to Sweden joining Nato, the US has agreed to fresh talks about Turkey buying F-16 fighter jets. <br/>Some observers including Wolfgang Hansson, a commentator for Sweden's largest tabloid Aftonbladet, argue that Sweden has potentially been used as a bargaining chip in a much bigger game being played by the Turkish leader.<br/>Public support for Sweden's Nato application rose sharply following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the issue has remained high on the public agenda over the past year.<br/>\"Media coverage of all the twists and turns has been intense, so many people have followed this closely, trying to interpret Erdogan's every new move,\" says Paul Levin, director of Stockholm University Institute for Turkish Studies, who has followed the developments closely.<br/>Yet Sweden's now increasingly imminent membership won't be popular with everyone. <br/>According to a May survey by pollster Novus, 38% of Swedes remain either against or unsure about Sweden joining Nato.<br/>Some critics have questioned Sweden's ideological shift, raising concerns about how it will affect the country's global image after decades as an international mediator. There are also concerns about the impact of negotiating with Turkey, a nation with a questionable human rights record.<br/>But for Nato supporters Sweden's membership is essential because it will offer the country additional security guarantees during a volatile period in European politics.<br/>Meanwhile Sweden's membership will also give Nato additional resources. <br/>Although it does not have a large military, it has re-introduced conscription and boosted defence spending in recent years, with a plan to raise its military budget to 2% of Sweden's GDP by 2026.<br/>How Sweden and Finland went from neutral to Nato<br/>Who are Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The offence comes under Hong Kong's draconian security law which was imposed three years ago after widespread pro-democracy protests took place in the former British territory in 2019.<br/>Hong Kong's Chief Executive John Lee told a media briefing on Tuesday that investigations against activists would intensify as Hong Kong authorities seek to \"pursue them for life\".<br/>\"We will exhaust all means to pursue them... We will also pursue the forces behind the scenes that support and perhaps even control them.<br/>\"As I have said, we should treat them as 'rats on the streets' and avoid them,\" he said, repeating earlier comments. <br/>Last week, Mr Lee urged the activists to give themselves up, adding that otherwise they would spend their days in fear.<br/>The countries in which the activists live - the UK, the US and Australia - do not have extradition treaties with China, and have condemned the order from Hong Kong authorities.<br/>However, at least five people with connections to the activists have been arrested in Hong Kong since the announcement. The police said they \"do not rule out the possibility that more arrests will be made\".<br/>Mr Law told the BBC last week he would have to be more careful following the order.<br/>He is one of the most prominent figures in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, and was one of the unofficial leaders of the 2019 demonstrations.<br/>After fleeing Hong Kong in 2020, he had issued a statement saying he had cut off all ties with his family.<br/>He told the BBC last week he felt his situation was \"relatively safe\" in the UK, but he would have to be more vigilant as a result of the bounty's announcement.<br/>\"There could possibly be someone in the UK - or anywhere else - to provide informations of me to (the Hong Kong authorities). For example, my whereabouts, where they could possibly extradite me when I'm transiting in certain countries,\" Mr Law said.<br/>\"All these things may put my life in to dangerous situations if I'm not careful enough of who I meet or where I go.

The compound is isolated, secure and private. <br/>Part training-hub, part medical facility, part re-education centre, this is where North Korean defectors are sent for three months when they arrive in South Korea.<br/>Its name is Hanawon, or to give it its full title, the Settlement Support Centre for North Korean Refugees.<br/>The number of North Koreans making the difficult and dangerous journey to South Korea - risking possible death if they are caught - to escape poverty and repression has fallen significantly in recent years.<br/>A decade or so ago, nearly 3,000 arrived each year. That figure dropped to around 1,000 in the years that followed and then to below 100 during the pandemic, when North Korea sealed its borders.<br/>Despite that, South Korea has reaffirmed its commitment not just to keeping Hanawon open, but to expanding its facilities.<br/>The government in Seoul believes that as Covid controls are relaxed in North Korea, more of its people will be able to flee. If that happens, Hanawon will again fill up.<br/>Unification Minister Kwon Young-se said South Korea needs to prepare to greet these new arrivals.<br/>\"We need to think of defectors not as aliens, but as neighbours whose hometown is in the North,\" he said.<br/>With its hedges, flowers and manicured trees, Hanawon appeared welcoming in the summer sun on Monday, when the South Korean government gave journalists a rare glimpse inside the facility.<br/>We were shown around a training centre, where North Korea defectors are offered 22 courses, in subjects such as hair and beauty, baking and clothes making.<br/>One room has been made to look like a nail parlour, where defectors learn the delicate art of the manicure. They use model hands to practice painting, polishing and filing.<br/>The delicious smell of baking fills the air; it has drifted down from a cookery class next-door.<br/>Other courses are aimed at helping the North Koreans adjust to life in a country that is, in terms of technology, decades ahead of where they came from.<br/>One classroom is set up like a shop selling high-tech gadgets. Tablets, smartphones and computers have been put on display.<br/>While the floor of another building looks like a modern hospital. There is a small ward, consulting rooms and doctors walking around in white medical coats.<br/>It is not just the physical needs of the North Koreans that are catered for; many arrive with severe psychological problems that need urgent attention. <br/>Dr Jeon Jin-yong is a psychiatrist who has worked at Hanawon. He has heard terrible tales of trauma from North Koreans who have passed through the facility.<br/>He said they have had to cope with the stress of escape, and the constant fear that they will be caught and sent back before they make it to South Korea.<br/>Many struggle to overcome the guilt of leaving relatives behind in North Korea who they might never see again.<br/>Some face prejudice in South Korea and so choose to hide the fact that they are from the North.<br/>\"One of my patients was once having lunch in a restaurant when on the television there was news about North Korea launching a missile,\" said Dr Jeon.<br/>\"He became very uncomfortable, so quickly finished eating and left the restaurant. He was worried about what people would think if they knew he was from the North.\"<br/>In an interview with journalists, three female defectors currently at Hanawon gave a hint of the difficulties they are trying to overcome.<br/>They were fearful of revealing their names and were introduced as A, B and C. One woman spoke from behind a screen.<br/>All three had arrived in South Korea after first escaping to China, where their lives were better than in North Korea - but still full of anxiety and danger.<br/>Woman B said she was unable to get a Chinese identity card, which meant she could not go to a hospital, get a bank card or even travel on a train.<br/>Woman C said she was paid half the wages of a Chinese worker because she was in no position to argue for more.<br/>They also described a tightening net of Chinese surveillance that had forced them to seek shelter in South Korea.<br/>\"When I first decided to defect I wasn't afraid of anything because I was all alone,\" said woman A. \"But then I had a child in China and realised I had no legal status.\"<br/>All three women spoke of their hopes - and trepidation - for the future. One of them said she was even worried about paying tax.<br/>Someone who knows what they are going through is Kim Sung-hui, who graduated from Hanawon just over a decade ago and now runs her own business making a rice wine that's popular in North Korea.<br/>In North Korea, Mrs Kim had been told that the South Koreans would initially welcome her - and then she would be tortured and killed.<br/>\"It wasn't until I graduated from Hanawon that I finally realised that I was safe,\" she said.<br/>Mrs Kim said the real education for those at Hanawon would begin only after leaving the facility.<br/>\"The first night on the outside is a memorable one for all defectors. I felt such relief that I was finally in South Korea. I hugged my daughter and started to cry - not because I was sad or lonely - but because we'd survived,\" the 49-year-old said.<br/>In those first few weeks on the outside, Mrs Kim remembers the kindness of South Korean volunteers who helped her adjust.<br/>They were there to welcome her when she stepped into her new home, they showed her around the local shops and even paid for her first ride in a taxi. She still keeps in touch with some of them.<br/>Those still at Hanawon will be hoping for similar success.<br/>North Koreans tell of neighbours starving to death<br/>The daughter who fled North Korea to find her mother<br/>From North to South: The new life of a Korean defector<br/>North Korea: Rare testimony from behind the closed border<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Hundreds of accusers have come forward.<br/>During the assault, Nassar was stabbed twice in the neck, twice in the back and six times in the chest, a prison union leader told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.<br/>The Federal Bureau of Prisons confirmed an inmate was assaulted at 14:35 EST (18:35 GMT) on Sunday at United States Penitentiary Coleman in Florida, where the former doctor is serving time. <br/>\"Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures,\" the agency told BBC News.

An audit of the Irish organisation's finances found irregularities with what was in the public domain and what the accounts actually showed.<br/>After further reading, the corporation has been accused of running \"a slush fund\" - spending thousands on flip-flops and gig tickets as well as millions on a failed musical, all \"while crying poverty\".<br/>Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said reform of how the institution is funded is well overdue.<br/>Unlike the BBC, the Irish broadcaster is funded using advertising revenue as well as a licence fee, and the scandal has dented the trust its audience has in it.<br/>\"RT\u00c9 has such a big place in Irish society, so this scandal was always going to be big news,\" freelance entertainment reporter Emma Kelly tells BBC News.<br/>\"The Late Late Show in particular is such a cultural touchstone, so when people find out that RT\u00c9 and Ryan Tubridy haven't been fully transparent, it's going to hurt.\" <br/>The programme Tubridy presented until recently is not only an Irish institution - with a packed live audience for more than two hours each Friday night - but is the longest-running late-night talk show in Europe. The format smoothly flips between light entertainment interviews to serious society debate, with pop stars performing in the studio as well.<br/>\"The whole thing feel feels like a betrayal,\" Kelly explains. \"The more ridiculous details that emerge or big names that get dragged in, the harder it is to look away.\"<br/>Tuesday will be the first time Tubridy has spoken publicly since the scandal was first reported. He'll appear with his agent Noel Kelly for hours of questioning.<br/>Before the controversy was made public, the 50-year-old stood down as host of The Late Late Show after nearly 14 years, to be replaced by Patrick Kielty.<br/>On Monday, former BBC News executive Kevin Bakhurst took over as director general and promptly stood down the entire executive board.<br/>He wrote in an email to staff: \"Change will be essential if we are to rebuild trust in public service broadcasting in Ireland and in RT\u00c9.\"<br/>RT\u00c9 board stood down by new director general<br/>Your questions on RT\u00c9's payment scandal answered<br/>New RT\u00c9 boss vows to 'restore trust' with public<br/>RT\u00c9 spent \u20ac5,000 on flip-flops<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Mr Stoltenberg said the two sides had worked together to address Turkey's \"legitimate security concerns\".<br/>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier suggested he would back Sweden if the EU re-opened frozen membership talks with Ankara - a request that was rejected by EU officials.<br/>Over their two-day meeting, Nato leaders are expected to agree new plans to deter and defend the alliance against future Russian aggression by beefing up their forces in the east. <br/>And they are also expected to step up their financial commitment, making the target of spending 2% of national wealth on defence a minimum figure, rather than a general ambition. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the UK prime minister would call on allies directly to meet this target. <br/>Security is tight in Vilnius, with Nato forces - including Patriot air defence missiles - defending a summit taking place only a short distance from Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. <br/>The overarching aim of the meeting is for Nato to convince President Vladimir Putin of the alliance's long-term military commitment to Ukraine. <br/>Officials hope this could begin to change the Russian leader's thinking, putting doubt in his mind that he can outwait the West. <br/>As such, some see this summit as potentially as important as military gains on the battlefield in persuading Mr Putin to change his strategy. <br/>So some Nato members will promise Ukraine new security guarantees. US President Joe Biden has suggested Ukraine could get the kind of military support his country gives Israel - long-term commitments designed to deter potential aggressors. <br/>The alliance will also deepen its institutional links with Ukraine. An existing forum - the Ukraine Nato Commission - will be upgraded to a Ukraine Nato Council. This will give Ukraine the ability to summon meetings of the alliance as an equal partner round the table. \"The right to consult is not insignificant,\" said one official.<br/>But perhaps most importantly, some members are expected to set out more explicitly Ukraine's pathway to joining the alliance. <br/>Nato agreed at its 2008 summit in Bucharest that Ukraine \"will\" become a member and supported its application. But the alliance did not say how and when this might happen. Critics say giving Ukraine a destination but no itinerary allowed Mr Putin to risk his invasions in both 2014 and 2022. <br/>Mr Biden will meet Mr Zelensky at the summit, a US official told Reuters, although the Ukrainian president is yet to officially confirm his participation at the event.<br/>Kyiv accepts Nato cannot formally invite Ukraine to join while fighting rages. That would risk plunging the alliance into war with Russia, as Nato would be obliged under Article 5 of its treaty to defend any member that is under attack.<br/>Instead, Kyiv wants a clear promise of post-war membership with a timeline, so it knows victory will bring the security guarantee of Nato's nuclear umbrella.  <br/>One way for Nato to signal its desire to welcome Ukraine into its ranks would be to shorten the so-called membership application plan, known as the MAP. This is the formal process which tests whether a country meets Nato's strict military and governmental standards - and it can take decades. <br/>But it is what Nato might actually say about Ukraine's potential membership that is dividing the alliance. <br/>The Baltic states and eastern European nations are pushing for as much clarity as possible. They want the alliance to make clear how much progress Ukraine has made towards membership, especially how much more closely its army can operate with other Nato forces, now that it shares similar weapons and strategies. They also want Nato to make clear what further conditions Ukraine must meet to achieve membership. <br/>Gitanas Nauseda, the president of Lithuania, said Nato should avoid Ukraine's membership becoming a horizon: \"The more you walk towards it, the farther it is.\"<br/>But some allies - including the US and Germany - are cautious about promising Ukraine too much. They want Ukraine to do more to tackle corruption, strengthen its judiciary and ensure civilian control over its military. <br/>Some also worry about Nato getting dragged into open conflict with Russia. They fear promising Ukraine membership after the war would give Putin an incentive both to escalate the conflict and drag it out, maintaining low-intensity fighting to prevent Ukraine ever joining. <br/>Other allies also fear losing room for manoeuvre in any post-war negotiations. They want to use the promise of Nato membership as a carrot for Ukraine and a stick for Russia, but only after the fighting has ended. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is Nato and why is Sweden joining?<br/>Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' weapons?<br/>Poland strengthens Belarus border over Wagner fears<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Travellers pay higher ticket prices and more tax. <br/>It is often cheaper to fly to another continent than to another African country.  <br/>For a quick comparison, flying from the German capital, Berlin, to Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul, will probably set you back around $150 (\u00a3120) for a direct flight taking less than three hours. <br/>But flying a similar distance, say between Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, you will be paying anything between $500 and $850, with at least one change, taking up to 20 hours. <br/>This makes doing business within Africa incredibly difficult, and expensive - and it is not just elite travellers that are affected.  <br/>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the global trade body representing some 300 airlines which make up about 83% of world air traffic - argues that if just 12 key countries in Africa worked together to improve connectivity and opened up their markets, it would create 155,000 jobs and boost those countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by more than $1.3bn. <br/>\"Aviation contributes directly to the GDP in every country. It generates work and it activates the economy,\" says Kamil al-Awadhi, IATA's regional vice-president for Africa and the Middle East.<br/>Adefolake Adeyeye, an assistant professor of commercial law at the UK's Durham University, agrees that Africa as a whole is missing out because of its poor air service.   <br/>\"It's been shown that air transport does boost the economy. As we've seen in other continents, budget airlines can improve connectivity and cost, which boosts tourism, which then creates many more jobs,\" she says.  <br/>The poor quality of road networks and lack of railways in many African countries often makes air transport the practical choice for cargo too.  <br/>The climate emergency, which has severely impacted Africa, means everyone needs to be more careful about their carbon footprint and should aim to fly a lot less. <br/>But even though around 18% of the world's population lives in Africa, it accounts for less than 2% of global air travel and, according to the UN's Environment Programme, just 3.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This is in contrast to 19% from the US and 23% from China.  <br/>Africa may be rich in minerals and natural resources, but of the 46 nations on the UN's Least Developed Countries list, 33 are on the continent, and poverty continues to be the biggest daily threat for millions of people on the continent.  <br/>But there is also a growing middle-class who could potentially travel by air if the tickets were priced at similar levels to Europe or elsewhere.<br/>African states have been trying for decades to integrate the aviation sector, but they haven't been successful, yet. <br/>\"There needs to be a coherent strategy by Africa to address the issue of its poor air service if they want to transform Africa's economies,\" says Zemedeneh Negatu, the global chairman of US-based investment firm Fairfax Africa Fund.<br/>He says that flights within Africa are still structured around cumbersome bilateral agreements from one country to the next, and that most  flag-carrying state airlines in Africa barely cover their costs, while some even run at a loss.  <br/>\"Every government in Africa wants to see their flag on the tail of an aircraft at Heathrow or JFK airport, but African governments need to realise that stand alone carriers are not viable.\" <br/>Mr Zemedeneh argues that African airlines should take inspiration from Europe and form major partnerships, such as between flag-carriers Air France and KLM of The Netherlands, and the Anglo-Spanish International Airlines Group (IAG) formed between British Airways and Iberia. <br/>He says even in the rich market of Europe, conglomeration is the way forward for airliners to survive, and provide a cheaper more reliable service. <br/>The current system in Africa is very fragmented, and although 35 countries are signed up to the Single African Air Transport Market, an African Union (AU) initiative to free up the skies to African airlines and bring down costs, it could be years before it's implemented.  <br/>IATA's Mr Awadhi says governments are reluctant to work together. <br/>\"There is a hard-headedness where each state thinks they know how to handle it better and will stick to their remedies even when they are not very effective,\" he says.<br/>\"In the end it's a business and there is a level of protectionism that starts to hurt the aviation industry. Then there is no benefit to having your own national carrier.\" <br/>There is one notable exception in Africa of an airline that is absolutely thriving, and that could provide a blueprint for others to copy - Ethiopian Airlines.  <br/>Just over 15 years ago the company employed about 4,000 people. Now that figure is over 17,000. <br/>It is state-owned but run entirely as a commercial venture without government interference. <br/>It has more than doubled the size of its fleet of cargo and passenger planes and has made Addis Ababa a regional hub, driving foreign currency into the Ethiopian capital, and boosting the country's service industry.  <br/>At the turn of the millennium Ethiopia was one of the poorest countries in the world, now it's one of the fastest growing economies. <br/>Mr Zemedeneh, an Ethiopian-American who played a key role as an adviser to Ethiopian Airlines as it developed its strategy, says Ethiopian Airlines has played a part in that boom. <br/>\"Ethiopian Airlines generates millions of dollars in hard currency for the country, and it makes every Ethiopian proud that they have been able to create one of the most successful indigenous African-owned, African-operated, multinational companies,\" he adds.    <br/>African travellers will be hoping these kinds of commercial successes will ultimately impact their airfares, bringing them down more in line with Europe or Asia - and that they can finally get to where they want to go more quickly and cheaply.<br/>One woman, 30 African countries, five lessons<br/>Waiting for take-off in West Africa<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The BBC's Russia Editor gets to grips with the latest twist in the Wagner saga.<br/>So, let me get this straight. <br/>On the morning of 24 June, the day of the mutiny, Vladimir Putin accused the Wagner leadership of \"treachery\" and \"a stab in the back\". Later that day, Russian air force pilots were killed, shot down by Wagner fighters.<br/>Then, with the mercenaries just 200km (120 miles) from the Russian capital, the Kremlin and Wagner did a deal. The mutiny was over. No-one was arrested. No-one has been prosecuted.<br/>Not only was Yevgeny Prigozhin not clapped in irons and hauled off to the police station for his rebellion - it's now emerged that five days later he was in the Kremlin, together with his commanders, sitting round the table and chatting with President Putin. <br/>Yet another twist and turn in a story that's already surpassed Dostoyevsky for levels of surprise and mystery.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Where is Yevgeny Prigozhin? And why does it matter?<br/>What we don't know, though, is what exactly was said at that meeting and how it concluded. Judging by what's happened since, this was no \"kiss and make up\". <br/>In recent days, the Russian state media has been working overtime to discredit Mr Prigozhin.<br/>Potentially embarrassing photographs allegedly taken during the raid of his St Petersburg mansion were leaked to social media and Russian TV. They showed gold bars, weapons and - bizarrely - a large collection of wigs. <br/>Last night Russia-1's flagship show, News of the Week, continued the character assassination.<br/>A report about Mr Prigozhin claimed: \"He's not the Robin Hood he tried to pass himself off as. He was a businessman with a criminal past. Many of his projects were dodgy and not always within the law.\"<br/>And what of that deal between the Kremlin and Wagner to end the mutiny on 24 June? According to the agreement, Mr Prigozhin was supposed to leave Russia for Belarus, along with those Wagner fighters who expressed the desire to join him. <br/>Last week the leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, told us that the Wagner chief and his mercenaries weren't there. To summarise his point: they might end up in Belarus - but they might not. <br/>So that's all clear then. Not.<br/>Where are Wagner? Where is Mr Prigozhin? What are their plans? What have they agreed with Mr Putin?<br/>I wish I knew. <br/>For now, all I can say is this: stay tuned for the next (inevitably bizarre) episode of Russia: the June Mutiny and the Kremlin. <br/>What is Russia's Wagner mercenary group?<br/>24 hours of mayhem in Russia<br/>Satellite images show activity at Belarus base<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Figures published on Tuesday show UK wages have risen at a record annual pace, fuelling fears that inflation will stay high for longer.<br/>The expectation of further increases has pushed up the cost of funding mortgages, and so lenders have been raising the rates they charge customers. <br/>At the hearing, Andrew Assam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group, told MPs this was changing the plans of first-time buyers.<br/>\"People are either putting down a larger deposit or buying a smaller property because affordability is tighter,\" he told MPs. \"We won't lend as much now, so people are moderating what they can afford to buy.\"<br/>People coming off fixed deals and looking for a new one could potentially have to pay hundreds of pounds more a month.<br/>Around 2.4 million fixed-rate mortgages are due to end between now and the end of 2024, according to figures from banking trade association UK Finance.<br/>Aaron Strutt, from mortgage broker Trinity Financial, said that the uncertainty of the situation made it difficult for lenders to price mortgages. A rush of people trying to secure deals at lower rates had meant the money allocated by some providers to lend in mortgages was drained. <br/>He added that there was evidence of a split with large numbers of people renewing with their existing lender, without the requirement for further affordability assessments.<br/>The recent rises in mortgage costs are also likely to have a knock-on effect on renters who could face higher payments as landlords seek to recoup the rising cost of higher mortgages. Squeezed landlords may decide to sell properties, which could lead to fewer homes available to rent, according to the National Residential Landlords Association.<br/>Following a meeting with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, lenders agreed to some flexibility and making sure homes are not swiftly repossessed from those struggling to pay.<br/>Labour is also planning to hold its own mortgage summit in the coming days.<br/>Read more here<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Are you struggling to pay your mortgage?

Regular pay fell by 0.8% after the effect of inflation was taken into account.<br/>The latest wage figures were higher than expected and Ashley Webb, UK economist at Capital Economics, said this \"won't ease the Bank of England's inflation fears significantly\".<br/>Last month, the Bank of England raised interest rates by more than expected, lifting its key rate to 5% from 4.5%. <br/>Mr Webb said that while he expected the Bank to push rates to 5.25% at its next meeting in August, he added \"we can't rule out\" an increase to 5.5%, saying \"much will depend\" on next week's inflation figure.<br/>Deutsche Bank said that an increase in rates to 5.5% next month \"now looks more likely than not\".<br/>Forecasts of more rate rises by the Bank have helped to push mortgage costs to their highest level for 15 years.<br/>In January, when the UK's inflation rate was above 10%, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promised to halve it by the end of the year.<br/>Mel Stride, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told the BBC's Today programme that while forecasts still suggest that would happen, \"it is not going to be easy\".<br/>The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also showed:<br/>There are indications that what is called \"tightness\" in the labour market - where there are too few workers to fit the jobs available - is starting to ease.<br/>However, business groups have continued to stress the difficulty of finding the right workers, despite the slight rise in unemployment and fewer vacancies.<br/>The government is now offering all workers a \"Midlife MOT\" on their careers to help those in their mid-40s and above to retrain.<br/>The ONS data showed that pay rises were highest for those in better paid sectors such as finance, and were lower in retail.<br/>The most up-to-date figures for just the month of May seem to show wage rises beginning to slow. This raises the possibility that pay increases have now peaked, which could lead to a calmer path for inflation.<br/>Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said that while wage costs remain \"very acute\" for companies there were some \"hopeful signs\" in the latest ONS figures, \"with the number of vacancies falling and more people coming out of inactivity back into the labour market\".<br/>The Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said: \"Our jobs market is strong with unemployment low by historical standards. But we still have around one million job vacancies, pushing up inflation even further.\"<br/>Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the figures were \"another dismal reflection of the Tories' mismanagement of the economy\".<br/>\"Britain is the only G7 country with a lower employment rate than before the pandemic and real wages have fallen yet again,\" he added.<br/>Read more tips here<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>How much are prices rising for you?

And the second is, as we set out in our national security review, China represents the largest state-based threat to economic security. <br/>\"So it's not a surprise that we should look carefully at Chinese transactions. But equally, we look across the board.\"<br/>Chinese firms have been targeted by regulators around the world in the last few years amid concerns that the Chinese state might use them for spying purposes.<br/>Prominent examples include telecoms giant Huawei, which was banned in 2020 from the UK's 5G mobile networks - a decision mirrored by other countries. <br/>Last year, Chinese-owned social media app TikTok was banned on UK government devices as part of a security review. <br/>In the report, Mr Dowden said the National Security and Investment Act was meant to be \"light touch\", incentivising investment in the UK, while also protecting national security \"in an increasingly volatile world\".<br/>He told the BBC that by blocking or imposing remedies on deals, foreign investors would have more confidence to invest in Britain \"because they know it's safe\". <br/>\"But at the same time, we cannot find ourselves in a situation where we totally decouple from an economy like China's, it's not in our national interest in terms of jobs and prosperity,\" he said.<br/>\"What we have to do is de-risk that engagement.

Some analysts have predicted interest rates will peak at 6.5%, but some have said they may rise to as high as 7%.<br/>The theory behind raising interest rates is that by making it more expensive for people to borrow money, and more worthwhile for people to save, people will spend less, which will in turn lead to price rises to slow.<br/>Mr Bailey said in his speech to executives at the same Mansion House event \"it is crucial that we see the job through, meet our mandate to return inflation to its 2% target, and provide the environment of price stability in which the UK economy can thrive\".<br/>He added that while the UK economy has failed to grow beyond its pre-pandemic level, there had been \"unexpected resilience\" in the face of external shocks, such as Covid and the war in Ukraine, with low levels of unemployment and avoiding a recession to date.<br/>But the Bank of England's boss highlighted that \"tightness\" in the labour market, with many businesses struggling to find enough workers, has contributed to price inflation being \"more sticky than previously expected\".<br/>\"Both price and wage increases at current rates are not consistent with the inflation target,\" he added.<br/>The Bank of England has previously warned big pay rises are contributing to the UK's still-high rates of inflation, but there have also been accusations that some sectors have been profiteering by overcharging customers.<br/>Last week, the Competition and Markets Authority revealed supermarkets had sought to increase profits from selling fuel, increasing their margins by 6p per litre on average between 2019 and 2022.<br/>The chancellor said \"delivering sound money is our number one focus\", before he delivered his speech focusing on plans for pension fund reforms.<br/>Mr Hunt pledged the plans could provide a \u00a31,000-a-year pensions boost to the typical earner who starts saving at 18.<br/>While UK pension pots are the largest in Europe, worth \u00a32.5trn, defined contribution schemes currently invest 1% in unlisted equity, limiting returns for savers and funding for businesses, the Treasury has claimed.<br/>The chancellor revealed an agreement with leading pensions firms to put 5% of their investments into early-stage businesses in the fintech, life sciences, biotech and clean technology sectors by 2030.<br/>The so-called \"Mansion House Compact\" has been backed by Aviva, Scottish Widows, Legal & General, Aegon, Phoenix, NEST, Mercer, M&G and Smart Pension.<br/>Ahead of the event, Mansion House organisers said talks had taken place about security at the venue over concerns of protests.

This would avoid the need for pilots used to the previous generation of 737 to undergo expensive retraining, something which would otherwise have made the plane less attractive to airlines.<br/>Two employees of the manufacturer, the coroner said, had deliberately deceived regulators and operators of the 737 Max over the operation of a safety critical system. <br/>The inquest heard Mr Pegram's parents describe the 25-year-old humanitarian worker as a kind, compassionate man with an infectious sense of humour.<br/>\"He had a passion for human rights, but also had the drive and inner strength to make a difference,\" his father Mark said.<br/>Ms Toole's father explained how his 36-year-old daughter, a sustainability campaigner, had \"the rare combination of empathy for animals and people\". <br/>The death of a child, he said was \"like losing a part of yourself,\" he added.<br/>Mr Vick, a humanitarian worker from Berkshire, was described by his mother Cheryl as a devoted father to his daughters, who had an \"unwavering focus on making the world a better place for as many people as possible\".<br/>Abdulqadir Qasim, a former Somali refugee, who arrived in the UK aged 25 had been on his way to Kenya to have a meeting about a new job when he died in the crash.<br/>There was no inquest into his death, but in a video statement in court on Monday, his wife Qamar described how he had been a \"wonderful husband and father\".<br/>His youngest son, she said, had been a toddler at the time of the crash and could not remember his dad.<br/>Prior to the Ethiopia crash, an identical failure caused another Boeing 737 Max to crash into the sea off Indonesia, killing 189 people.<br/>The 737 Max was eventually grounded for 20 months after the two crashes.<br/>The company has admitted responsibility for the loss of the Ethiopian flight, but in an agreement with the US government it gained immunity from prosecution in exchange for $2.5bn (\u00a31.9bn) in fines and compensation.<br/>Families of Boeing 737 crash victims seek answers<br/>Boeing to pay $200m over 737 Max crash statements<br/>Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

None.\"<br/>Mr Chandrasekhar added that Foxconn and Vedanta were \"valued investors\" in the country and \"will now pursue their strategies in India independently\".<br/>The Indian government has been working on strategies to support the chipmaking industry.<br/>Last year, it created a $10bn fund to attract more investors to the sector, in a bid to become less reliant on foreign chipmakers.<br/>Prime Minister Modi's flagship 'Make in India' scheme, which launched in 2014, is aimed at transforming the country into a global manufacturing hub to rival China.<br/>In recent years, several other firms have announced plans to build semiconductor factories in India. <br/>Last month, US memory chip giant Micron said it would invest up to $825m to build a semiconductor assembly and test facility in India.<br/>Micron said that the construction of the new facility in Gujarat will begin this year.

When it announced the app's launch, the company said it would add a \"more robust search function\" along with improvements to the selection of recommended posts.<br/>Meanwhile the only way currently to fully delete a Threads profile is to delete the associated Instagram account, which many users would be reluctant to - another issue the company is looking to fix.<br/>When Threads was launched, Meta announced it planned to allow it to communicate with other social-media platforms, such as Mastodon, using something known as the fediverse.<br/>But this suggestion while welcomed by some, has met opposition.<br/>The idea of the fediverse is it is like email. Someone on Gmail can exchange emails with someone using Hotmail, for example, and the fediverse could be described as that idea applied to social media.<br/>At some point in the future Meta wants users to be able to use their Threads account to interact with other social-media platforms using ActivityPub - a protocol with the necessary programming code - such as Mastodon, WordPress or Reddit-alternative Lemmy.<br/>But some worry Threads threatens the idea of this system altogether, because of a practice big tech companies have utilised in the past - \"embrace, extend and extinguish\", when a company with a lot of resources extends what is possible from a new technology so drastically it becomes the new standard, leaving people with no choice but to use its platform.<br/>Mastodon chief executive Eugen Rochko dismissed these fears, saying Meta joining Threads was \"validation of the movement towards decentralised social media\" and \"a clear victory for our cause\".<br/>But concern among users has grown with over a hundred Mastodon communities joining what they call the \"fedipact\" - an agreement to block Meta from being able to access their community under any circumstances - so even when Threads does begin to support ActivityPub, users will not be able to access everything on the fediverse.<br/>One other feature coming to Threads at some point may also receive mixed reviews.

It will still operate about 90,000 journeys over the period.<br/>A spokesperson for EasyJet said the whole airline industry was seeing \"challenging conditions this summer\" as the closure of Ukrainian airspace due to Russia's war caused congestion in the skies and disrupted flights. <br/>They also said planned strikes by air traffic controllers in Europe could have an impact. <br/>\"We have therefore made some pre-emptive adjustments to our programme consolidating a small number of flights at Gatwick, where we have multiple daily frequencies, in order to help mitigate these external challenges on the day of travel for our customers,\" the spokesperson said.<br/>\"Customers whose flights are affected are being informed, with 95% of customers being rebooked onto an alternative flight and all customers provided with the option to rebook or receive a refund.\"<br/>Passengers have a number of rights under UK law if they are:<br/>Airlines must offer the choice of a refund or alternative flight, regardless of how far in advance the cancellation was made.<br/>Return tickets must be fully refunded if either leg is cancelled.<br/>And passengers have a right to be booked on another airline - or other suitable mode of transport - if it is going to their destination significantly sooner.<br/>Last year, a huge increase in demand following the easing of Covid travel restrictions coincided with major staff shortages at airlines and airports, leading to long queues and cancelled flights. <br/>Across 2022 as a whole more than a third of UK flights were delayed.<br/>Airlines and airports claimed to be in a much better position this year but admit the situation in Ukraine and air traffic problems could create difficulties. <br/>Walkouts by French air traffic controllers have caused disruption in the first six months of 2023, leading Ryanair to cancel 650 flights in April alone. <br/>Meanwhile, Eurocontrol, which manages flights over Europe, said one of its unions could take industrial action this summer, although no dates have been announced yet.<br/>Strikes by air traffic controllers (ATC) in France had affected services from Northern Europe to key holiday destinations such as Spain and Portugal, said travel industry analyst John Strickland.<br/>The rerouting of flights into already congested skies made matters worse, he told the BBC, while ATC shortages in countries such as Greece and Denmark led to further delays. <br/>\"If we then factor in the unknowns such as bad weather - summer storms being the best example - then an already stretched system simply cannot cope and the volume of delays and cancellations multiplies,\" Mr Strickland said.<br/>Negotiations are continuing with unions and experts say the potential impact of any strikes is unclear. <br/>Airlines UK, which represents the industry, said that airlines have \"made huge efforts since the pandemic to build resilience into operations\". <br/>It added that its members were \"looking forward to a busy summer, meeting growing demand for travel and carrying millions of people on holidays\".<br/>Travellers' taste in destinations also appears to have altered since Covid.    <br/>Cirium said demand in July for flights to Turkey, Greece and Croatia has outstripped pre-pandemic levels. <br/>But departures to key destinations such as Spain, France and Italy have fallen short.  <br/>It said flights to Italy and France comparing July 2019 to the same month this year both fell by 13%.  <br/>Departures to Spain are down 6% compared to pre-Covid July.<br/>However, it remains the most popular destination with 14,962 flights between the UK and Spain booked for this month.  <br/>Has your flight been cancelled?

The extra funds are also dependent on Thames improving its business plan to revive the company.<br/>News of the extra funds came as Thames released its annual results, which showed it incurred an underlying pre-tax loss of \u00a382.6m for the year to 31 March.<br/>Thames Water serves a quarter of the UK's population and leaks more water than any other water company in the UK - losing the equivalent of up to 250 Olympic-sized swimming pools every day from its pipes.<br/>Last week, Thames was fined \u00a33.3m for discharging millions of litres of undiluted sewage into two rivers in Sussex and Surrey in 2017, killing more than 1,400 fish.<br/>The company is owned by a group of investors. The largest is Canadian pension fund OMERS followed by the Universities Superannuation Scheme, the pension fund for UK academics.<br/>The regulator for the water industry, Ofwat, will be questioned by MPs on Wednesday amid accusations that it has been too lax in its oversight of the sector.<br/>At the weekend, Sir Robert Goodwill, a Conservative MP who chairs the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, told the BBC the regulator had been \"very complacent\" over Thames Water and had questions to answer over whether it had \"been asleep at the wheel\".<br/>Last week, Ofwat chief executive David Black gave evidence to the Lords' business committee when he said Thames would need \"substantial sums of money\" to stabilise its finances.<br/>He also admitted the regulator had taken a \"relatively hands-off approach\" to managing water companies since the industry was privatised in the late 1980s.<br/>Thames Water's current debt amounts to 77% of the value of the business, Ms Ross told the BBC, which she said was the lowest level of indebtedness in a decade for the company.<br/>However, Thames is the most heavily indebted of England and Wales' water companies, and interest payments on more than half of its debt rise in line with inflation, which has remained stubbornly high in recent months.<br/>Thames Water has said that it has not paid dividends to external shareholders for the past five years.  <br/>But Sir Robert Goodwill told the BBC he suspected that Thames' holding company was taking money out in the form of debt payments, rather than as dividends.<br/>However, Ms Ross said there was only a very small amount of debt that came from Thames' holding company.<br/>\"In the last year, we paid \u00a345m out to service the debt that is essentially provided by our shareholders, through the holding company. Our revenues last year were \u00a32.3bn - so you're talking about less than 2% of our revenues went to service that debt,\" she told the BBC.<br/>\"The vast majority of the debt that our regulated business has comes from bondholders in the open market.\"<br/>Ms Ross was chief executive of Ofwat between 2013 and 2017. <br/>She rejected a suggestion that the regulator's oversight of the water industry was affected by the potential for people to move from working at Ofwat to a potentially lucrative role in the private sector.<br/>\"I don't accept that,\" she told the BBC, adding that when she joined Thames Water she had spent three-and-a-half years working at telecoms company BT.<br/>Asked if it had been her ambition to working in the industry after Ofwat, Ms Ross said: \"I can honestly say the thought had never occurred to me at the time that I worked for Ofwat.

Meta, which also owns Facebook, said the app had 10 million users within the first seven hours of launch and more than 30 million by Thursday morning.<br/>Around 24 hours later, that figure had more than doubled. <br/>It still has some way to go to catch its main rival though. At 100 million, Threads' user base stands at less than a third of the 350 million users that Twitter is believed to have.    <br/>Some Twitter users have become disenchanted since billionaire Elon Musk took over. Thousands of jobs have been cut under his ownership and he has announced a number of changes to help generate revenue at Twitter.<br/>Other rivals have emerged like Mastodon and Bluesky but have struggled without an existing user base. <br/>Threads has capitalised on being linked to Instagram which has more than one billion users.<br/>People who sign up to Threads will display a link to their profile in the app in their Instagram profile but there is an option to hide this.<br/>In order to sign up for Threads, users must have an Instagram account. <br/>It is not possible to delete your Threads profile without deleting the associated Instagram profile.  <br/>However, deactivating your Threads profile will not deactivate your Instagram account. <br/>Deactivation will mean your Threads profile, your posts and interactions with others' posts won't be visible, Meta says.<br/>Since Threads' launch, Twitter has threatened the rival with legal action. <br/>A lawyer for the company accused Mr Zuckerberg of \"systematic, wilful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property\" to create Threads. <br/>Twitter claimed that Meta had hired former employees who \"had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information\".

He runs Our Place in Annan, near Lockerbie - he is also chair of the Scottish Hospitality Group.<br/>\"Just as we were trying to take the business from five to seven days a week, bang we lost two members of staff, both front of house,\" he said. <br/>But it means he may have to cut down his opening hours. \"If I have to close to make sure my staff aren't burned out, I will. Why risk losing more staff for financial gain?\"<br/>However, he is hopeful of recruiting soon - his business is offering interest-free loans and cost-of-living grants to employees as incentives in a tight labour market.<br/>Now, Mr Montgomery's plight, along with others, has been highlighted by the former environment secretary and outgoing MP Mr Eustice who has picked up the post-Brexit staffing baton. Speaking in the Observer, Mr Eustice called for a reciprocal visa scheme for under-35s to work across the EU and Britain.<br/>\"I am very sceptical about a skills-based immigration policy because we have no shortages in those areas, but where we do have shortages is in hospitality, it's quite acute there. We could have a two-year youth mobility scheme which would have no permanent impact on immigration numbers,\" he told the BBC. <br/>An industry outlook by Deloitte for 2023 said disruptions due to staff shortages, underpinned by high inflation, would likely increase and last beyond 2025. <br/>The accounting firm also forecast a lack of economic growth and rising costs, with an inability to raise prices as the key risks in the sector. <br/>Staffing is a problem for the Lamplighter Dining Rooms in Windermere, in the heart of the Lake District. <br/>Open 365 days of the year it can seat 100 guests but owner James Tasker said filling the rota had been \"more of a challenge\" since the pandemic. <br/>\"The southern European contingent just didn't come back,\" he said. \"Then there's the surging cost of living, coupled with unaffordable rental accommodation, that's in phenomenally short supply here.<br/>\"We may face certain days where we have to restrict the volume of guests, which is disappointing but it's not all about the money.\" <br/>Having fewer guests was preferable to giving customers bad service and getting negative reviews. \"We're conscious of our reputation,\" Mr Tasker added. <br/>The background to these challenges are post-Brexit working regulations and Covid, both of which have severely affected the sector. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the level of vacancies was still 48% higher than pre-Covid levels. <br/>An ONS update is due on Tuesday but it said available roles fell by 22% over the last year, standing at 132,000 in May. <br/>\"The workforce shortage is creating a serious crisis as we head deeper into the peak summer season,\" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. \"Nearly half of businesses are reducing trading hours per day, and a third are having to close on some days each week.\"<br/>James Dixon-Box, deputy manager at Bournemouth's 95-bed Marsham Court Hotel in Dorset, said hoteliers in the town had been forced to think laterally to combat staffing issues. <br/>\"We work really hard on cross-training so we have staff who are multi-skilled. Finding chefs is not the easiest thing but we do a lot of work with colleges and schools and have student apprentices,\" he said.<br/>One of them is a 16-year-old who has just started work in the hotel kitchen and will spend the summer holidays being trained as a chef. The process will take six to eight weeks.<br/>Mr Dixon-Box said: \"There's no use moping about saying there's a skills gap, the best way is to teach people and for them to learn.\" <br/>Further north, Buzzworks runs 19 restaurants across Scotland and employs 800 staff, turning over \u00a335m last year. But finding chefs is a problem. \"It's our most acute shortage,\" said owner Kenny Blair. <br/>The entrepreneur has obtained an immigration licence \"which was not cheap\" but it allows him to recruit staff from abroad - most recently India.<br/>Mark McCulloch set up Hospitality Rising to attract young people to an industry they would never have considered before.<br/>\"It's a viable career path, the pay is better than you think,\" he told the BBC. <br/>Backed by 300 businesses it has the support of big hitters like Michelin-starred chefs Tom Kerridge, Angela Hartnett and Raymond Blanc. <br/>Mr McCulloch, a former marketing executive with Pret a Manger and Yo! Sushi, said without a full team it \"leads to customer disappointment\". <br/>Renewed calls for jobs in the hospitality industry to be added to the shortage occupation list come after the government's Migration Advisory Committee last rejected the idea in March. <br/>A spokesperson for the Home Office told the BBC it worked to ensure its points-based system \"delivers for the UK\" and that included reviewing the shortage occupation list \"to ensure it reflects the current labour market\". They added that many hospitality roles such as chefs are eligible under the points-based system. <br/>Hotels and bars need more EU workers, say bosses<br/>Immigration rules relaxed for builders and carpenters<br/>Who is allowed to come to live in the UK?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

On Monday, an inquest in Horsham, West Sussex will finally take place into the deaths of three of the British citizens who were on board.<br/>For relatives of those who died, it is a landmark moment.<br/>Lawyers for the families will be seeking a verdict of unlawful killing.<br/>The inquest will look into the deaths of humanitarian workers Sam Pegram and Oliver Vick, as well as sustainability campaigner Joanna Toole.<br/>\"Sam was just a joy to have in your life,\" his mother Deborah says, blinking back tears. \"Right from when he was a little boy, he wanted to help people.\"<br/>Sitting at home with her husband Mark and her other son Tom, she struggles to find the right words to tell me about the wound that opened up in their lives when the plane went down.<br/>She talks about 25-year-old Sam's smile, and his wicked sense of humour.<br/>\"He just made our lives better, really\u2026 and he's left a really big hole.\"<br/>The family have spent the past four years fighting legal battles, trying to gain some kind of justice for Sam, as well as to obtain compensation.<br/>Now they're simply exhausted.<br/>\"It's just been a constant struggle,\" says Mark. \"I mean, on top of the grief and the normal things that you deal with having lost somebody, you to have to continually relive it. <br/>\"You have to tell that story to your lawyers, to opposition lawyers, to a forensic psychologist\u2026 going right into the depths of what you were feeling the day you found out. <br/>\"It's taken its toll.\"<br/>Flight ET302 - a passenger flight from Ethiopia to Kenya - crashed shortly after take-off because of a design flaw. <br/>Flight control software that was meant to be used in very limited circumstances to make the plane easier and more predictable to fly deployed at the wrong time due to a sensor failure.<br/>It pushed the aircraft into a catastrophic dive, despite the pilots' frantic efforts to keep it in the air. But arguably that plane should never have left the ground in the first place.<br/>Just months before, an identical failure had caused another 737 Max to crash into the sea off Indonesia, costing 189 lives. Yet the model was allowed to continue flying.<br/>Boeing later admitted responsibility for the loss of ET302. <br/>But under the terms of an agreement reached with the US government in 2021, it gained immunity from prosecution, in return for paying $2.5bn in fines and compensation.<br/>That deal was done quietly, without the knowledge of the victims' families. It has been challenged in court, so far without success. <br/>Sam's brother Tom is furious at what he sees as a failure to hold anyone to account for the disaster.<br/>\"I feel like, how can you believe in justice when there's people that are responsible for hundreds of deaths?\" he says.<br/>\"You'd think in a world where there's justice, within weeks or months there would be people in prison. And there obviously isn't, to this day.\"<br/>At the recent Paris Airshow, I met one of Boeing's top executives, chief strategy officer Marc Allen, and I asked him if he had a message for the bereaved families.<br/>After expressing \"such deep sympathy and condolence\" for those who lost loved ones in both crashes involving the 737 Max, he emphasised Boeing's new commitment to safety.<br/>\"We can be sure we can show up and tell them, 'here's what we do better now, in the face of this terrible, terrible loss,'\" he said. <br/>Reeling off a long list of changes that have been made within the company, he told me he disagreed \"with this idea that there hasn't been full accountability throughout the organisation\".<br/>For the Pegrams though, these were \"just words\". <br/>For the family now, the priority is to keep Sam's memory alive. They plan to use compensation funds from Boeing to set up a charitable foundation, to promote the humanitarian causes he cared about.<br/>\"We can help refugees, asylum seekers, and we can also help young people who want to go and do the work like Sam did,\" says Mark.<br/>Meanwhile, with the crash having occurred in Ethiopia, and most of the legal wrangling in the United States, the inquest is seen as a vital step.<br/>It is the only formal inquiry into the affair to take place in this country, and the verdict - though largely symbolic - could send out a powerful message.<br/>And for Joanna Toole's father, Adrian, it also serves another purpose.<br/>\"For me, it represents what may be my only opportunity to actually talk about Joanna to what is effectively a captive audience,\" he says.<br/>\"And what I hope to point out is what has been lost with Joanna's death. <br/>\"To her partner, Paul, to me, and to the international sustainability effort.\"<br/>Boeing to pay $200m over 737 Max crash statements<br/>Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Well, by one very basic metric, yes. <br/>The US and China are once again talking to each other, face to face, politely and respectfully, if not warmly. <br/>It's a stark contrast to trans-Pacific communication during the Donald Trump administration, which was done largely via the megaphone of social media. <br/>The tone and the content from both sides is more positive and more measured. Ms Yellen's trip follows US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's high-stakes visit in June, where both countries pledged to stabilise relations.<br/>At the end of her trip on Sunday, Ms Yellen said it would help to build a \"resilient and productive channel of communication with China's new economic team\". That should not be discounted. <br/>In March this year, much of the top tier of China's government was replaced with men whose primary qualification is loyalty to leader Xi Jinping. Key among them is the country's new economic chief, He Lifeng. <br/>On Saturday Janet Yellen spent much of the day with Mr He. She said their talks had been \"direct, substantive and productive\", while admitting that the two sides had \"significant disagreements\". <br/>Throughout her visit Ms Yellen sought to persuade her Chinese hosts that under President Joe Biden, America is not fundamentally hostile to China. <br/>\"We do not see our relationship in terms of great power conflict\", she said, and \"we do not seek to decouple\" our economies from each other. <br/>It appears the Biden administration is trying to demonstrate that its China policy is not simply a continuation of the Trump administration's open hostility to Beijing. Did she succeed?  We are still waiting to hear from the Chinese side. <br/>But as the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. And from Beijing's perspective, some recent actions of the Biden administration are anything but friendly. <br/>Key among them is the imposition of export controls on certain US microchips that are used in the development of artificial intelligence. <br/>Far from being eased, the US is now moving to widen those restrictions to other high-tech exports to China, while leaning hard on its allies, from Japan to Germany, to the Netherlands, not to supply China with the means to make the most cutting-edge microchips. <br/>America's motivation is simple: It doesn't want China to have easy access to American technologies that could give it an edge in things like AI, and in military technologies that could one day be used against the US in a future conflict over, for example, Taiwan.<br/>All of this means that while dialogue has re-opened, and looks set to accelerate in the coming months, the process is delicate. <br/>Progress made in the last few days could very easily be knocked back by another \"spy balloon\" incident, or a close call between US and Chinese naval ships or aircraft. <br/>Even the most optimistic experts believe this is now a very difficult relationship that will require careful, long-term management by both sides in order to keep it stable.<br/>Yellen criticises Chinese curbs against US firms<br/>US urges China to co-operate on climate action<br/>China curbs exports of key computer chip materials<br/>Can China overtake the US in the AI marathon?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Travellers pay higher ticket prices and more tax. <br/>It is often cheaper to fly to another continent than to another African country.  <br/>For a quick comparison, flying from the German capital, Berlin, to Turkey's biggest city, Istanbul, will probably set you back around $150 (\u00a3120) for a direct flight taking less than three hours. <br/>But flying a similar distance, say between Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, you will be paying anything between $500 and $850, with at least one change, taking up to 20 hours. <br/>This makes doing business within Africa incredibly difficult, and expensive - and it is not just elite travellers that are affected.  <br/>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the global trade body representing some 300 airlines which make up about 83% of world air traffic - argues that if just 12 key countries in Africa worked together to improve connectivity and opened up their markets, it would create 155,000 jobs and boost those countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by more than $1.3bn. <br/>\"Aviation contributes directly to the GDP in every country. It generates work and it activates the economy,\" says Kamil al-Awadhi, IATA's regional vice-president for Africa and the Middle East.<br/>Adefolake Adeyeye, an assistant professor of commercial law at the UK's Durham University, agrees that Africa as a whole is missing out because of its poor air service.   <br/>\"It's been shown that air transport does boost the economy. As we've seen in other continents, budget airlines can improve connectivity and cost, which boosts tourism, which then creates many more jobs,\" she says.  <br/>The poor quality of road networks and lack of railways in many African countries often makes air transport the practical choice for cargo too.  <br/>The climate emergency, which has severely impacted Africa, means everyone needs to be more careful about their carbon footprint and should aim to fly a lot less. <br/>But even though around 18% of the world's population lives in Africa, it accounts for less than 2% of global air travel and, according to the UN's Environment Programme, just 3.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This is in contrast to 19% from the US and 23% from China.  <br/>Africa may be rich in minerals and natural resources, but of the 46 nations on the UN's Least Developed Countries list, 33 are on the continent, and poverty continues to be the biggest daily threat for millions of people on the continent.  <br/>But there is also a growing middle-class who could potentially travel by air if the tickets were priced at similar levels to Europe or elsewhere.<br/>African states have been trying for decades to integrate the aviation sector, but they haven't been successful, yet. <br/>\"There needs to be a coherent strategy by Africa to address the issue of its poor air service if they want to transform Africa's economies,\" says Zemedeneh Negatu, the global chairman of US-based investment firm Fairfax Africa Fund.<br/>He says that flights within Africa are still structured around cumbersome bilateral agreements from one country to the next, and that most  flag-carrying state airlines in Africa barely cover their costs, while some even run at a loss.  <br/>\"Every government in Africa wants to see their flag on the tail of an aircraft at Heathrow or JFK airport, but African governments need to realise that stand alone carriers are not viable.\" <br/>Mr Zemedeneh argues that African airlines should take inspiration from Europe and form major partnerships, such as between flag-carriers Air France and KLM of The Netherlands, and the Anglo-Spanish International Airlines Group (IAG) formed between British Airways and Iberia. <br/>He says even in the rich market of Europe, conglomeration is the way forward for airliners to survive, and provide a cheaper more reliable service. <br/>The current system in Africa is very fragmented, and although 35 countries are signed up to the Single African Air Transport Market, an African Union (AU) initiative to free up the skies to African airlines and bring down costs, it could be years before it's implemented.  <br/>IATA's Mr Awadhi says governments are reluctant to work together. <br/>\"There is a hard-headedness where each state thinks they know how to handle it better and will stick to their remedies even when they are not very effective,\" he says.<br/>\"In the end it's a business and there is a level of protectionism that starts to hurt the aviation industry. Then there is no benefit to having your own national carrier.\" <br/>There is one notable exception in Africa of an airline that is absolutely thriving, and that could provide a blueprint for others to copy - Ethiopian Airlines.  <br/>Just over 15 years ago the company employed about 4,000 people. Now that figure is over 17,000. <br/>It is state-owned but run entirely as a commercial venture without government interference. <br/>It has more than doubled the size of its fleet of cargo and passenger planes and has made Addis Ababa a regional hub, driving foreign currency into the Ethiopian capital, and boosting the country's service industry.  <br/>At the turn of the millennium Ethiopia was one of the poorest countries in the world, now it's one of the fastest growing economies. <br/>Mr Zemedeneh, an Ethiopian-American who played a key role as an adviser to Ethiopian Airlines as it developed its strategy, says Ethiopian Airlines has played a part in that boom. <br/>\"Ethiopian Airlines generates millions of dollars in hard currency for the country, and it makes every Ethiopian proud that they have been able to create one of the most successful indigenous African-owned, African-operated, multinational companies,\" he adds.    <br/>African travellers will be hoping these kinds of commercial successes will ultimately impact their airfares, bringing them down more in line with Europe or Asia - and that they can finally get to where they want to go more quickly and cheaply.<br/>One woman, 30 African countries, five lessons<br/>Waiting for take-off in West Africa<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But Mr Namasivayasivam recently divulged his blunder to dozens of people at an event in Toronto, Canada.<br/>His mistake seven years ago involved his work trying to ensure that when bands and solo artists submitted 10-second long, looping videos to accompany their songs, they would play smoothly on people's mobile phones.<br/>At the time the videos were being trialled in Canada.<br/>They should have been streamed to users' handsets just the one time, but due to Mr Namasivayasivam's error they were constantly re-downloaded onto people's phones every 10 seconds.  <br/>For those not connected to wi-fi, it quickly used up all their data.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam only became aware of the mistake when he read complaints on an online forum. One person had written that it had \"killed his data\".<br/>Another said: \"I hate this feature so much. Whoever came up with this, should be fired and shot.\"<br/>While most of us might have wanted to keep such memories locked away, Mr Namasivayasivam revealed all into a microphone while standing on a stage in front of room full of strangers.<br/>The gathering was part of a global movement, with more than 250 cities now participating in public showcases of how entrepreneurs and other business leaders, mainly in the tech space, fail and then recover from their gaffes.<br/>The idea is that it is cathartic to talk about such things, and everyone in attendance can learn from the mistakes, and ask questions.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam told the crowd in Toronto: \"It was at this moment that I messed up, and this is where the feelings of imposter syndrome and anxiety and shame came flooding in.\"<br/>He was one of three speakers at the event. Afterwards he told the BBC that it felt good to share his face-palm moment, \"and how someone can bounce back from that embarrassment\".<br/>Today Mr Namasivayasivam is the founder and chief executive of Skillify, a Toronto-based provider of software coding training.<br/>Bill Murray (not the famous actor), works for Canadian software firm Padiem, which makes systems that enable firms to handle timesheets and wages.<br/>He was in the audience watching Mr Namasivayasivam, and says that the story particularly resonated with him. <br/>\"If you've never made any mistakes as a coder, you probably weren't innovating enough,\" says Mr Murray.<br/>\"Most people want to hide their embarrassing moments or failures, but because the speakers open the floor with some of their toughest moments, it sets the stage for everyone attending to let their guard down and really get to know one another.\"<br/>Tech entrepreneurs shouldn't only celebrate their wins, Mr Murray adds. \"When you study someone's success, it's almost like asking them what lottery numbers they played to win.<br/>\"Of course you can learn lots from successful people, but to me the concept of openly talking about your failures felt like there was much more to learn from.\"<br/>Marsha Druker, who organises the regular failure talks in Toronto, says she looks for speakers willing to not just be open about their professional failure story.<br/>Instead she also wants them \"to tell audiences about what they learned about that mistake, now that they have had time to reflect on it\".<br/>She says a common theme to what tech entrepreneurs face when they fail is \"a story of resilience and coming out at the other side, and recognising that failure shouldn't be a taboo topic we don't talk about openly\".<br/>Venturing into that often off-limits topic is the reason why such celebrations of failure began in Mexico City in 2012, says Carlos Zimbr\u00f3n, a Mexican tech entrepreneur who first came up with the idea for the evenings.<br/>During a barbeque at home with other friends, Mr Zimbr\u00f3n says he expressed how boring it was to attend \"typical conference with keynote speakers talking about their successes, and how it was rare to hear the B-side of that story\".<br/>Soon after, he and his friends held the first failure talk in the same backyard space.<br/>As word spread about the Mexico City event, other entrepreneurs in cities in 80 countries around the world have since started their own parallel nights. They hold monthly talks, coupled with a Q&A session after each speaker.<br/>Mr Zimbron says that the talks, many of which are later uploaded to YouTube, \"can be inspiring for people who may have gone through the same problems\".<br/>He adds: \"When you can connect to someone else's mistakes, and can see how vulnerable they are in sharing that story, that's where you can connect with other entrepreneurs.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Leah Edwards, is both a director at US investment fund Lighter Capital, and a lecturer on leadership and innovation at University of California, Berkeley.<br/>She says she loves that these public talks about business failure are \"normalizing the fact that something is hard, and that it takes a number of at-bats [a baseball term for a batter's turn] in order to find the right combination of teams and market opportunity, and the right product or service\".<br/>Ms Edwards adds Silicon Valley has long had a high tolerance for start-ups not succeeding, and that it is good to see this spreading.<br/>\"There will always be entrepreneurs whose companies don't work out in the end, but they pick themselves back up and try again,\" she says. \"I'm excited to see this recognition of that kind of resilience spreading into other geographies and cultures.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

A recent survey suggested 14% of people with the illness have since lost their jobs. <br/>Before the pandemic, Marcus Whitehead had a demanding and fulfilling career in financial services in London. But after catching coronavirus in 2020, he became far too ill to work.  <br/>Three years on, although he is physically much better, brain fog has prevented the 55-year-old from returning to his job.  <br/>Marcus, who lives in Harpenden, feels a \"sense of loss\" at retiring early and losing his mental agility. \"I was no longer who I was,\" he says.<br/>It was in April 2020 that Marcus first developed symptoms of Covid-19.  <br/>\"It was typical corona - a temperature, a cough - a bit like flu. It wasn't too bad and I was able to work a bit,\" he says.  <br/>But a few days later it hit him \"like a tonne of bricks\" and he experienced \"crushing, paralysing fatigue, like you'd been injected with horse tranquiliser\".<br/>Marcus also suffered \"fierce organ pain\" and intense headaches, spending the following three months in bed. <br/>\"I spent another 12 months on the couch. For 18 months I didn't drive and had to use a walking stick. And I haven't been able to work since.\"<br/>Marcus was managing partner of actuary firm Barnett Waddingham, overseeing 1,000 members of staff. <br/>He likens the role of co-ordinating client strategy and supporting employees to \"spinning plates\". <br/>\"I was juggling dozens of plates a day, and then after Covid I was turned into this person who could hardly hold a single plate, let alone spin dozens.\"  <br/>In 2022, he attempted to reintegrate at work with support from his company.  \"I managed two days\", he explains, \"and I was back in bed with a massive relapse.  <br/>\"It was quite soul-destroying, when I'd been so close to getting back to work. The first time I put my brain under any kind of pressure, it just gave up on me again.\"<br/>Eventually it became clear that Marcus would have to leave his high-performance job, and he decided to retire a decade earlier than planned.<br/>\"I'm very fortunate to have a lot of health back. But it's been quite a dramatic change in what I expected of that decade up to my early sixties,\" he says. <br/>The personal cost to Marcus has also been felt in the wider economy. A survey in March of 3,000 people self-reporting long Covid found 14% of them had lost their jobs for reasons connected to the condition. <br/>Of the two million people in the UK who report having long Covid, 20% feel significantly limited in their ability to undertake day-to-day activities, according to the Office of National Statistics.<br/>Claire Hastie is a founding member of the charity Long Covid Support, whose online support group has over 60,000 members. She set it up after struggling to find any information or help when she failed to recover from the virus.<br/>\"Huge numbers of people are no longer able to work at all, or to their previous capacity, having to reduce their hours and take less senior roles,\" she says. <br/>Claire believes Marcus's story highlights a significant need for \"urgent research\" into the \"debilitating condition\". <br/>\"At a time of labour and skills shortages, the impact of long Covid on the economy is significant,\" she says. <br/>As well as those who have stopped working, \"others are struggling to keep their jobs but at a huge cost to their health and ability to do anything else\", she adds.<br/>And it is not just limited to those with long Covid, but their families too. Marcus's wife Sue also decided to stop working for a while to help him recover.  <br/>\"I spotted that Marcus's health was better on weekends, when we're doing stuff together and I'm not working ten-hour days, leaving him to his own devices.\"<br/>She believes that giving up her job, as a capital programme director for a local authority, has been the secret to \"unlocking\" his recovery.<br/>Although Marcus still struggles with brain fog, his physical health has recently improved. <br/>The couple were left to look for solutions, trawling social media for advice, as \"the medical profession did not have any cures and still doesn't\". <br/>So they tried anything and everything to improve his condition. \"I felt like a guinea pig. At times I would beg Sue not to bring another attempted solution,\" he says. <br/>He spent time in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, changed his diet and took all kinds of pills and supplements - \"even resorting to buying medication from Bangladesh\".<br/>Sue also worked on pacing his energy levels, which led to some improvements alongside \"an exceptionally good diet\" with no ultra processed foods.<br/>But the real change came earlier this year, through a programme called the lightning process, which is not endorsed by the NHS but has been used to treat people with chronic fatigue syndrome.  <br/>The privately funded programme focuses on interactions between the brain and the body.<br/>\"The turnaround was really quite dramatic,\" Marcus says. \"I was already on a good underlying healing curve, but this boosted it.<br/>\"There isn't medical, scientific proof - it is just my personal experience - but I tried an awful lot of things that haven't worked. Now I feel physically much better.\"  <br/>Sue says the couple are now spending time travelling and visiting friends, after observing that Marcus felt better when they went away. <br/>\"We've called it the Year of Yes,\" she says. \"Anything that's happening, we're going to try and do it.\"<br/>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was providing \u00a350 million to scientists to better understand the long-term effects of coronavirus.  <br/>\"We recognise that long Covid has debilitating impacts on physical and mental health. We have invested \u00a3314 million to establish specialist services throughout England to direct people experiencing long Covid into the right treatment and rehabilitation services, including occupational health services.\"<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

In the business world, the fight has already begun.<br/>Less than 24 hours after Mr Zuckerberg launched his alternative to Twitter, Threads, it had already claimed some 30 million sign-ups - lending it credibility as a serious contender in the world of social media.<br/>That's still a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of Twitter users. <br/>But analysts think it's a sign that Mr Zuckerberg's Meta has a good shot at wooing some of its gigantic 3 billion-plus users on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to the new offering - and bringing advertisers with them.<br/>After all, Mr Zuckerberg, whose Meta made more than $117bn in sales last year, has a monster track record when it comes to selling adverts - and none of the apparent qualms of Mr Musk, who has disdained advertising at his electric car company, Tesla, and been looking for alternative ways to fund Twitter. <br/>Mr Zuckerberg said there would be no ads on Threads initially, giving the company time to fine-tune the app, which allows users to scroll endlessly through text-based posts. <br/>\"Our approach will be the same as all our other products: make the product work well first, then see if we can get it on a clear path to 1 billion people, and only then think about monetization at that point,\" he wrote. <br/>But eventually, Threads adverts could add 1% to 5% to Meta's overall revenue, generating more than $6bn in the most optimistic scenario, Justin Patterson, equity research analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a note.  <br/>That's not huge. But it's also not nothing, especially as the company continues to look for ways to combat the hit to ad sales sparked by stricter privacy rules from Apple. <br/>And it is well within striking distance of Twitter, which generated $4.5bn in ad revenue in 2021, before Mr Musk's takeover sparked upheaval. <br/>Whether that money materialises will depend on what Threads becomes, if anything, in the weeks and months ahead. <br/>Mr Musk was ready on Thursday with the counter-punch, reportedly threatening legal action against Meta for stealing trade secrets.<br/>But frustration with Twitter has left plenty of people hungry for an alternative; and Meta's promise of a \"saner, kinder place\" than Twitter \"supercharged\" early sign-ups, Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg said.<br/>\"Posting. With optimism,\" quipped Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker, one of the celebrities jumping into the fray alongside Shakira, Oprah and Khloe Kardashian.<br/>Success will depend on winning over Twitter's power users or people who never signed up for the app in the first place - no sure bet, analysts said.<br/>Though the fashion and lifestyle content that is the bread-and-butter of Instagram clearly holds appeal for advertisers, it is not clear the world needs another platform to consume it.<br/>Mr Zuckerberg also has a complicated relationship with news, one of Twitter's main functions. <br/>He has said surveys show users want less of it on the platforms he runs and in Canada, his company is preparing to block local reporting, rather than pay news providers there for their content.  <br/>\"News hounds and avid Twitter loyalists aren't likely to defect... and Meta will need to keep Threads interesting to maintain the momentum once the novelty wears off,\" Ms Enberg said, adding that Mr Zuckerberg - who has been skewered before for creating copycat products - has \"struggled\" with innovation. <br/>Advertisers will also be looking for confidence that they are not spending money on a platform exposing them to risks tied to issues like misinformation and privacy.<br/>Under Mr Musk, Twitter, which had struggled to be profitable, has alienated advertisers with abrupt changes to how the site moderates content and more recently, a new limit on how many posts audiences can see. <br/>Analysts say Meta has already been one of the beneficiaries from Twitter losing business.<br/>But Mr Zuckerberg is not coming to the table with a clean record either. <br/>His company has clashed with marketers for years over the transparency and accuracy of its data, while its handling of user data and misinformation has drawn widespread criticism. <br/>\"Advertisers want a clean ... well-lit environment where content is moderated on the terms and conditions agreed to, on a consistent basis,\" said marketing veteran Lou Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory. \"Overall right now social media is a bit of a dumpster fire.\"<br/>Meta shares popped 4% on Wednesday ahead of the launch - a sign of investor confidence that Mr Zuckerberg has the ability to make it work, despite flops like Facebook Dating. <br/>But replicating the way that news breaks on Twitter will be difficult, Mr Paskalis said, leaving room for both platforms to exist.<br/>Or, he suggested, the presence of a serious threat could prove a \"wake-up call\" for Mr Musk.<br/>\"One of the keys will be how long will Threads eschew advertising,\" Mr Paskalis said. \"Whatever that period of time is, that's the period of time that Twitter has to right that ship.\"<br/>Twitter threatens legal action over Threads app<br/>Threads could cause real problems for Twitter<br/>'Almost every influencer will be hopping on Threads'<br/>30 million join Meta's Twitter rival - Zuckerberg<br/>Musk and Zuckerberg agree to hold cage fight<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

While analysts said Mr Biden's comment was unlikely to have a major negative effect, it was also widely seen as not helping matters.<br/>In another sign that the trade dispute between the two countries is far from being resolved, China this week announced it was tightening controls over exports of two materials crucial to producing computer chips. From next month, special licences will be needed to export gallium and germanium from China, which is the world's biggest producer of the metals.<br/>The move follows Washington's efforts in the past year to curb Chinese access to some advanced computer chips. In October, Washington announced it would require licences for companies exporting chips to China using US tools or software, no matter where they are made in the world.<br/>The US and China face a complex set of issues, said Priyanka Kishore from the business forum IMA Asia.<br/>\"The official rhetoric and visits by senior diplomats indicate a desire to establish a working political relationship between the two countries,\" she added. \"But the actions suggest otherwise, with the tit-for-tat policies dominating.\"<br/>During meetings with her counterparts in Beijing Ms Yellen is expected to make clear that the US will continue to defend human rights and its national security interests.<br/>However, she is also expected to emphasise Washington's willingness to work with Beijing on issues, including climate change and the problems faced by heavily-indebted countries.<br/>While some high-profile figures have called for the US to completely break economic ties with China, Ms Yellen will take a more placatory approach. She is expected to tell her counterparts in Beijing that Washington does not intend to decouple the two economies.<br/>This is in line with her worldview, which is more globalist than some of her predecessors, as she outlined in a speech earlier this year: \"A full separation of our economies would be disastrous for both countries. It would be destabilising for the rest of the world.\"<br/>\"I would say it's a little bit like good cop, bad cop, Blinken being the bad cop,\" former International Monetary Fund chief economist Ken Rogoff told the BBC.<br/>\"And now Yellen going in as the good cop trying to say, look, you know, we have a lot in common. Let's see what we can do together,\" he added.<br/>In his role as secretary of state, Mr Blinken had to raise some hard issues, such as Taiwan and Ukraine, Mr Rogoff said.<br/>However, Mr Rogoff cautioned that this should not be taken as a sign that Ms Yellen will be soft on Beijing as she is likely to press Chinese officials on a number of issues, including intellectual property laws and access to markets.<br/>Also, while some figures on both sides of the US-China divide talk of splitting away from one another, the reality of the interdependence can be seen in trading figures.<br/>Trade between the two countries grew in 2022 for the third year in a row, with official figures showing China exported more than $536bn (\u00a3422.3bn) worth of goods to the US last year, while $154bn of goods went in the other direction.<br/>But even as Washington and Beijing try to resolve their differences, the spectre of the US presidential election looms.<br/>\"If there is a second Biden administration beginning after 2024, on the economic front I expect loosening of many of the Trump-era trade sanctions and tariffs, in particular ones less related to high technology sectors,\" Professor Eric Harwit of the Department of Asian Studies at the University of Hawaii said.<br/>\"However, if Donald Trump wins the 2024 election, all bets are off.\"<br/>China curbs exports of key computer chip materials<br/>China's new law tightens Xi's powers against the West<br/>Netherlands to restrict chip equipment exports<br/>Biden calls Xi a dictator a day after Beijing talks<br/>Japan plans to restrict some chip-making exports<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

A blue lake sparkles in the sunshine below.<br/>Many would call the view breathtaking, but Alan Viader, a second generation winemaker at Viader Vineyard and Winery says what he sees now, is an overgrown forest. <br/>\"Potential fuel,\" he calls it. <br/>Northern California's Napa Valley had a historic wildfire season in 2020. The first blaze erupted in August, consuming hundreds of thousands of acres and killing five people.<br/>Then in late September another - dubbed the \"Glass Fire\" - quickly became the most destructive wildfire in the famous wine region's history.<br/>It engulfed Alan's winery, destroying some of the prized old vines, and incinerating two of the buildings on the property. After 24 hours of waiting, and praying, firefighters deemed the area safe, and Alan was finally able to return to his vineyard, where trees were still burning. <br/>\"I felt very helpless,\" Alan recalls. \"I know what I can do. I know where we have our fire hoses and all our pumps. I know how to protect the property. But I just wasn't able to get up here and that was a struggle.\"<br/>The perennial presence of wildfires is forcing him, like many others in the region, to confront a harsh reality - harvest season is now also fire season. <br/>Nearly three years after the Glass Fire, Alan hasn't just adapted the property, rebuilding with fire resistant materials, paving wider roads for fire engines and mobile water tanks, he's also undergone training and is now a certified firefighter.<br/>\"There's a huge connection, a real parallel with firefighting. We play with pumps and hoses, too, except our hoses are full of wine,\" he says. \"I'm always dragging hoses somewhere\".<br/>Just across the valley sits Storybook Mountain Vineyard, where 86-year-old Jerry Seps still gets up at 05:00, puts on his straw hat, and tends to his vineyard, just like he has everyday for nearly 50 years.<br/>In 2017, when flames started to threaten Jerry's land and livelihood, he decided to not evacuate, and instead to try to fight the flames himself. He was told he single-handedly saved the winery. <br/>He blushes at the memory and sighs. <br/>\"You're not saving a vineyard, you're saving your life,\" he says. \"This is our life choice. And I've put a lot into it. The family's put a lot into it. And it was too much to lose without a struggle.\"<br/>Fast forward three years, and there were more ferocious fires to fight, but it wasn't the flames that posed the greatest threat. Instead it was the smoke.<br/>The wine that's finally bottled after fermentation is a living entity that ages and develops. And what winemakers in the region quickly realized is that even if the vines are saved from the flames, the pernicious effects of the smoke can be even more costly than the fires themselves.<br/>Jerry attempted to make wine after the 2020 harvest, hoping that his crop had been spared. But once testing began, he discovered that smoke taint had affected two-thirds of his grapes, and therefore the resulting wine.<br/>\"So we just poured it down the drain,\" he says. \"We took the economic loss in a feeling that we have a very strong reputation. And we really care about the people that drink our wine and we want to keep that reputation.\"<br/>California's wine industry is worth around $40bn (\u00a332bn) to California's economy. Winemakers across the Napa are desperately seeking solutions to smoke taint. <br/>Prof Anita Oberholster, at the University of California at Davis, is leading research into how the impact of smoke taint can be mitigated. She's become a wine \"doctor\", helping to cure sick wine. <br/>Prof Oberholster says there are some filtration techniques, like reverse osmosis, and treatments involving activated charcoal which are already used to remove bitter compounds from wine. But these treatments can remove more than just the ashy taste created by compounds from the smoke, they also takeaway some of the wine's complexity.  <br/>\"Unfortunately, both of these also impact the overall quality of the wine. So you probably will need to sell that wine at a lower price level, because the quality will be impacted.<br/>And that's the problem, you can still make wine after wildfires, but in a region that exists on a world renowned reputation built up over many decades, can they make Napa quality wine?<br/>At Realm Cellars, head winemaker Benoit Touquette takes a sip of his prized cabernet sauvignon and loudly slurps it with pleasure. He calls the noise \"the sound of joy.\"<br/>He and his team decided not to make any red wine with the 2020 harvest because of the smoke taint. It was a decision that cost the winery more than $25m.<br/>More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade.<br/>\"It's not just make or don't make,\" he says. \"You've got to think about everything at once.<br/>\"What if it goes bad in the consumer's hand? What does it mean for the brand? There's the instance where there is no income, but there's also the longevity of the brand and our values.  There's much more at stake than the income which is a tremendous number.\"<br/>Just up Silverado Trail, the main road that winds through Napa Valley, sits the Signorello Estate It was the only Napa winery to burn to the ground in 2017. Almost six years on, the rebuilding process continues.<br/>Priyanka French, the head winemaker at the winery, is helping oversee the construction of what will be one of the most fireproof wineries ever built, she says they are only using non-flammable materials and will produce most of the wine in underground caves, as a natural form of fire protection. <br/>Despite the increased threat of fires and the black smoke they billow, she feels positive about the future.<br/>\"As long as we're being conscientious, not just of being responsible as environmental stewards, but really thinking about what the industry in Napa is going to be able to say about itself in the future, I think it's exciting.<br/>\"I think we're having some really interesting and important conversations about important issues at the moment.

Around the world, governments that also oppose the popular technology are watching the showdown closely to see who will blink first.<br/>\"End-to-end encryption\", \"backdoors\" and \"client-side scanning\" - the biggest row in technology sounds very complicated.<br/>But really it comes down to a very simple question. Should technology companies be able to read people's messages?<br/>That is the crux of a row that has been brewing for years between Silicon Valley and the governments of at least a dozen countries around the world.<br/>WhatsApp, iMessage, Android Messages and Signal all use the super-secure system called end-to-end encryption.<br/>The technology means only the sender, at one end, and the receiver, at the other, can read messages, see media or hear phone calls. Even the app makers cannot access the content. <br/>In the past 10 years, end-to-end encrypted apps have become increasingly popular, with billions of people using them every day. <br/>Most governments and security agencies reluctantly accepted the technology's rise - until four years ago, when Mr Zuckerberg announced on stage the Messenger app and then Instagram would move to end-to-end encryption as standard. <br/>\"We're going to enable more than two billion people around the world to have their most personal conversations with each other privately,\" he said.<br/>Since then, Mr Zuckerberg and his army of engineers have slowly and quietly been cracking on with the project. The company is refusing to speak to reporters on the record about how the mammoth task is going or when the big switchover will be. \"By the end of 2023,\" is all it will say publicly.<br/>Meanwhile, the calls to stop the switchover or build in safeguards have been growing louder.<br/>Authorities in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, India, Turkey, Japan and Brazil - plus law-enforcement agencies such as Interpol - have criticised the technology.<br/>But no government in the democratic world has risked passing a law that will interfere with these popular apps - until now.<br/>Making technology companies build in some sort of technical backdoor to allow messages to be scanned for illegal material is one of the central tenets of the UK's wide-reaching Online Safety Bill, which looks likely to be passed into law in the near future.<br/>Police officers, if they can no longer ask Meta for the contents of people's messages, will miss out on a key source of evidence they regularly use to convict criminals or terrorists, the government says. <br/>And there is a particular concern about children being groomed online in secret.<br/>End-to-end encryption \"will be a huge boon to anyone who wants to hurt a child\", Home Secretary Suella Braverman wrote to Mr Zuckerberg on Monday.<br/>And on Wednesday, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has released a YouGov survey it commissioned, suggesting the British public wants police officers to be able to access people's messages, to protect children. <br/>Of the 1,723 adults surveyed across the UK, 73% said technology companies should, by law, have to scan private messaging for child sexual abuse and disrupt it in end-to-end encrypted environments.<br/>Most already scanned for child sexual abuse on their services, leading to many successful convictions, the NSPCC said.<br/>\"It is now clear that companies who wish to pit children's fundamental right to safety against the privacy rights of adults are out of step with the public and, ultimately, their user base,\" Richard Collard, at the charity, said.<br/>In response to the survey, a Meta spokesman said the company had \"developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse\" - age restrictions for contacting strangers, for example.<br/>Also on Wednesday, as if to highlight the passions on both sides of the debate, 68 prominent security and privacy researchers have published a letter saying the Online Safety Bill would effectively break end-to-end encryption.<br/>The bill puts the onus on tech firms to find a way to implement child safety measures whilst maintaining privacy for users but the experts say this is impossible. <br/>\"Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety,\" the letter says.<br/>\"This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online.\"<br/>It also sets a precedent for repressive regimes around the world to monitor and control what people are sharing, experts say.<br/>WhatsApp and Signal, meanwhile, have said they would rather remove their services from the UK than degrade end-to-end encryption security.  <br/>And to make matters worse for critics of the technology, Elon Musk announced, in May, he too was building end to end encryption, into Twitter messages.<br/>Switching to the technology is complex and expensive, as evidenced by Meta, but ultimately worth it tech bosses think.<br/>After years of data scandals, big tech sees it as key to rebuilding trust in its services.<br/>And in a happy coincidence, end-to-end encryption makes these embattled companies' tricky job of moderation a lot easier - if they cannot see what users are sharing, then neither can they police it.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

He helped mastermind some of the biggest hits of the 1980s, working with the likes of Sade and Spandau Ballet. He lost his sight in his mid-thirties and this has shaped the way he works with artists. <br/>\"Singers who are very pretty or handsome, without knowing it, are quite disarmed by me,\" says Sir Robin. <br/>This suits his working method. To encourage artists to sing with emotion, he invites them to \"sing ugly\", he tells me, as we sit in his south London home studio. <br/>\"I want them to adopt mannerisms and facial expressions that reflect what they are going through.\"<br/>They need to do this so he can capture the emotional turmoil they feel inside.<br/>It's easier to not care what you look like when you are working with a blind producer, he reflects.<br/>Sir Robin grew up in north London and loved music from an early age, showing an aptitude for playing the guitar. <br/>However, his world changed at the age of 16 when he found out that he would progressively go blind, because of the genetic condition retinitis pigmentosa.<br/>It was a stroke of luck that gave him his initial ticket into the music world. His sister married Mick Taylor, who joined The Rolling Stones in 1969. He toured with the band and observed the magic of the music-making process.<br/>He tried a range of jobs, including being a solo musician, before setting up his own music studio in London. Possessing a nose for business, he created a record label and management business in parallel to his recording work, which over time has made him millions.<br/>His biggest hits came in the 1980s, from his recordings with Fine Young Cannibals, Boy George (who nicknamed him \"Golden Ears\"), Terence Trent D'Arby, Spandau Ballet and Everything But The Girl. But the record that cemented his reputation was Diamond Life by Sade, one of the best-selling albums of the decade, containing smash hits Smooth Operator and Your Love is King.<br/>It was during the recording of Sade's follow-up album in France in the mid-80s that he finally lost his sight completely.<br/>Rather than tell the band though, he started an argument as an excuse to leave, then phoned his wife, asking her to come out and take him home - which is where it hit him.<br/>Hung on the walls of his house were his gold and platinum discs.<br/>\"I thought, 'I can't even see these wretched things anymore. What's it all for?' Smash, smash, smash.<br/>\"But I think it's important to note the next day, my wife and I put them back up and pieced them together and got them reframed.<br/>\"When a person's got a disability, you have this feeling you are trying to crawl out of a big hole. You've got to the point where your elbows are on the grass, but your feet are still dangling. Every day you are focusing on trying to get out of that hole, but sort of knowing that you can't, then every now and then you lose your footing and fall back down. In France I fell down the black hole. But pretty quickly you want to scramble up. There is a natural buoyancy in our human nature.\"<br/>With his discs restored to pride of place, he got back to work in the studio. Artists like Laura Marling and Emeli Sande have enjoyed his services since.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Many in the music industry fear the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) threatens the very essence of authentic songwriting, but not Sir Robin. <br/>\"Artificial intelligence is in the news, but it is not new for the music industry,\" he argues.<br/>Computer-generated music was used by The Who and Pink Floyd, and even the autotune technology in Cher's 1998 hit Believe is another example of AI in action, he says. <br/>The music industry is perfectly able to adapt, he reckons, and his own label Blue Raincoat Music, which bought Chrysalis Records, will work with AI and the opportunities it brings.<br/>But what AI cannot do is replace humans in the recording process, or replicate the \"real emotion\" that is the key ingredient in hit songs, says Sir Robin.<br/>He has tricks to test whether his studio alchemy has distilled that magic quality.<br/>He plays the song on small speakers that distort the sound. He plays the song in the background while holding a conversation with someone. He plays the song and listens to it from a different room, imagining it is \"playing faintly in the distance from a Greek taverna\".<br/>His ears are straining to hear \"real emotion\" that will \"catch people deep down\" and let listeners feel compassion for the singer.<br/>He sees his job as a producer as akin to that of a psychologist or mentor, helping the artist explore the true feelings behind the songs, which often involves discussing their childhoods.<br/>A good example of that was Wonderful Life, by Black, he recalls, which drew on many of singer Colin Vearncombe's early experiences and his relationship with his mother.<br/>He heard the same pure emotion in Adele's Someone Like You, when he first heard it. <br/>\"I stopped in my tracks in the supermarket because I'd had an emotional reaction to something and I didn't know what it was. After 40 seconds I had tears in my eyes. It was compassion for her [and the story told in the song].\"<br/>Music generated by AI will be able to simulate emotion, but it won't have what Sir Robin calls \"that lovely chain\" - the genuine human backstory that powers the voice in the song, which producers like him strive so patiently to coax out of the artist.<br/>You can follow CEO Secrets reporter Dougal Shaw on LinkedIn<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

He also had a short period as chief executive of US giant Hewlett-Packard.<br/>He believes Europe has got a lot to offer.<br/>Partially retired, the 69-year old divides his time between Paris and London and has spent the last decade advising small software companies.<br/>Today he has a new role, as one of a team of tech veterans determined to end Europe's underwhelming record of producing giant technology firms.<br/>Mr Apotheker is part of Boardwave, the brainchild of Phill Robinson. Mr Robinson is a British former software boss who has lived in Silicon Valley and retired after a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease. <br/>Boardwave grew out of Mr Robinson ruminating on what he could do to lift Europe's tech scene to Californian levels.<br/>Mr Apotheker joined Boardwave the day after its website went live. As Mr Robinson puts it, \"we're grateful for the careers we've had and the opportunity to share what we know.\" <br/>Both are driven by a pressing sense of passing time and a desire to spare future generations of tech pioneers the pains they endured.<br/>Mr Apotheker points out that Europe does have some leaders. He highlights specialist fields such as industrial design programs and the UK's lead in financial software. London's financial technology (fintech) scene wins his approval. <br/>But why aren't there more?<br/>He rejects the traditional argument that finding money is much easier in the US. <br/>\"I don't think this is about raising capital, Europe is awash with venture capital companies.\" <br/>Investors will sink $50bn into European tech businesses in 2023, according to venture capital firm Atomico.  <br/>One problem for European tech entrepreneurs is a lack of peers. <br/>\"I lived in Silicon Valley and there's always a group of people around who can give you advice. When I ran SAP and needed advice I talked to the wall!, \" says Mr Apotheker.<br/>\"Boardwave is trying to mentor other company bosses to help them grow. Being in charge can be a very lonely job. You worry about something in the middle of the night and it keeps on chewing at you. The value of picking up the phone and talking to someone is huge.\"<br/>He sees Boardwave's team saving his youthful successors from those sleepless nights and guiding the big ideas to fruition. <br/>More technology of business:<br/>Mr Apotheker still wishes he could have had a sympathetic guide to share concerns with when he ran SAP. \"There were a lot of decisions I struggled with at SAP and I wish I could have talked with someone who'd been there before me, someone I could bounce ideas off.\"  <br/>Boardwave was also born out of a sense that time is not on the side of wise older guys. \"Of the few hairs I have left lots of them are grey. So I'm willing to spend the time I have left on this.\" <br/>That includes talking about decisions that did not work out.<br/>\"We talk about mistakes we've made. We've made a lot of mistakes, and got a few things right!\" <br/>European scepticism is often cited as a poor contrast to the overwhelming optimism of Silicon Valley.<br/>Yet Mr Apotheker values the ability to ask penetrating questions in an industry with its fair share of fraudulent ventures such as Theranos, the Silicon Valley start-up whose founder Elizabeth Holmes has just begun an eleven-year prison sentence for defrauding investors. <br/> \"I am of mixed German/French heritage and I can be cynical and sceptical but I turn that to an advantage.\" <br/>His colleague, 58-year old Mr Robinson, is candid about how Parkinson's Disease motivates him. \"I've accumulated a lot of knowledge of the software sector and I want to share it with others before my brain gets mushy.\"<br/>He took one of the first computer science degrees in the UK and  worked in Silicon Valley at the age of 23, beginning an impressive career in business software. <br/>\"I believe Europeans have a great talent pool but it's fragmented. We're 1,000 miles across while Silicon Valley is 40 miles long.\" He founded Boardwave on his kitchen table in 2022 and it now has 800 members, chief executives and founders across Europe. <br/>Start-ups registered with Boardwave can connect with these mentors. Boardwave aims to shepherd them towards the critical stage of \u00a3100m turnover when they can spread their wings on the international stage. <br/>Other established initiatives echo Boardwave's drive to expand Europe's top tier of tech. Finland hosts a huge annual gathering, Slush, where tech start-ups can meet potential investors. <br/>The boss of Finnish success story WithSecure, a cybersecurity business that confronts the global threat of malware, hacking and ransom demands, is Juhani Hintikka. <br/>He too does pro bono coaching for local start-ups and agrees with the concept behind Boardwave. \"People do ask for advice and I try to do my bit.\" <br/>But he admits innovators are curbed by Europe's fragmentation, with multiple business cultures as opposed to the vast home market US companies can tap into.<br/>Ever ambitious, Mr Apotheker cites planemaker Airbus as a great European guiding light. \"European airline makers came together to take on Boeing and Airbus is now the largest in the world.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It says the figure is likely to rise by 73% to 3.88 billion tonnes by 2050.<br/>Plastic is particularly problematic. From the start of large-scale production of the material in the 1950s until 2015, more than 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste was produced, research from the Universities of Georgia and California calculated.<br/>Someone who will not find those statistics surprising is Mikela Druckman. She has spent a lot of time looking at what we throw away, as the founder of Greyparrot, a UK start-up that has created an AI system designed to analyse waste processing and recycling facilities.<br/>\"In a single day you will have literally mountains of waste in one facility coming through, and what's very shocking and surprising is that it never stops,\" she says. There are no holidays for waste, it just keeps coming.\"<br/>Greyparrot places cameras above the conveyor belts of around 50 waste and recycling sites in Europe, utilising AI software to analyse what passes through in real-time.<br/>AI technology has come on in leaps and bounds over the past year, and its ability to process images is now very sophisticated. However, Ms Druckman says it was still hard to train a system to recognise rubbish.<br/>\"A product like a Coke bottle, once it goes into the bin, will be crumpled, crushed and dirty, and makes the problem much more complex from an AI standpoint.\"<br/>Greyparrot's systems now track 32 billion waste objects per year, and the firm has built up a huge digital map of waste. This information can be used by waste managers to become more operationally efficient, but it can also be shared more widely.<br/>\"It is allowing regulators to have a much better understanding of what's happening with the material, what materials are problematic, and it is also influencing packaging design,\" says Ms Druckman.<br/>\"We talk about climate change and waste management as separate things, but actually they are interlinked because most of the reasons why we are using resources is because we're not actually recovering them.<br/>\"If we had stricter rules that change the way we consume, and how we design packaging, that has a very big impact on the value chain and how we are using resource.\"<br/>She hopes that big brands and other producers will start using data generated by firms like GreyParrot, and ultimately design more reusable products.<br/>Troy Swope runs a company that is intent on making better packaging. Footprint has worked with supermarkets, and with Gillette to convert its plastic razor trays to ones made of plant-based fibre.<br/>In a blogpost on Footprint's website, Mr Swope claims that consumers are being misled by a \"myth of recycling\".<br/>He referenced a plastic salad container that was labelled \"ready to recycle\" and asked what that actually meant.<br/>\"It's less likely than ever that their discarded single-use plastic ends up anywhere but a landfill,\" wrote Mr Swope. \"The only way out of the plastics crisis is to stop depending on it in the first place.\"<br/>So-called greenwashing is a big problem, says Ms Druckman. \"We've seen a lot of claims about eco or green packaging, but sometimes they are not backed up with real fact, and can be very confusing for the consumer.\"<br/>To help retailers know that used plastic bottles are in fact being recycled, and in what numbers, UK-firm Polytag covers them with an ultraviolet (UV) tag that is not visible to the human eye.<br/>When the bottles then arrive at the determined recycling plants, the tags are read by a Polytag machine. The number of bottles is then uploaded to a cloud-based app in real time, which Polytag's customers can access.<br/>\"They can see exactly how many bottles are being recycled, which is something these brands never had access to before,\" says Polytag's project manager Rosa Knox-Bradley.<br/>So far the firm has worked with UK retailers Co-Op and Ocado.<br/>To make it easier for people to recycle, and encourage more to do so, the UK government and the administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland are due to launch a deposit return scheme in 2025.<br/>This is due to see \"reverse vending machines\" located in shops and other public areas, where people will be able to deposit used plastic bottles and metal drinks cans, and be paid money for doing so - around 20p per item.<br/>The search to find a planet-friendly way to get rid of rubbish remains a tough race, however, as seemingly every year a new trend comes along to throw a spanner in the works.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>The latest is an addiction to e-cigarettes, or vapes, which are creating a whole new mountain of electronic waste that is hard to recycle.<br/>\"It's a huge problem. And it's getting bigger,\" said Ray Parmenter, head of policy and technical at the Chartered Institute of Waste Management. <br/>He adds that the \"fundamental issue\" is disposable single-use vapes, which he says \"are basically an anathema to the circular economy\".<br/>Disposal vapes are composed of many materials - plastics, metals, a lithium battery and some even have LED lights or microprocessors.<br/>Research last year from Material Focus, an organisation that campaigns for more recycling of electrical products, suggests 1.3 million vapes are thrown away per week in the UK alone. This means that some 10 tons of lithium goes into landfill every year, enough to power 1,200 car batteries.<br/>\"The way we get these critical raw materials like lithium is from deep mines - not the easiest places to get to. So once we've got it out, we need to make the most of it,\" says Mr Parmenter.<br/>Vapes are a good example of how we need to change thinking, says Ms Druckman.<br/>\"It doesn't make economic sense, it doesn't make any sense. Rather than ask how do we recycle them, ask why we have single-use vapes in the first place?\"<br/>While industry and policy-makers have big roles to play in making products more recyclable or reusable, so do consumers, she adds. And the biggest change they can make is to \"consume less\".<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

When we meet in a warehouse, his mouth is covered and he wears smart-looking sunglasses. <br/>Nearly all of his \"customers\" are regulars, he says, paying off their debts within two or three months. They're usually back again a few weeks later.<br/>D adds that with inflation remaining high, demand has soared. He now hears from single mums and families looking to borrow smaller amounts of \u00a3500 to \u00a31,000 to pay gas and electricity bills or for groceries.<br/>For those customers, he charges interest rates of up to 50%, but others more commonly face \"double bubble\" interest, where the original loan is doubled.<br/>Most of D's clients would probably accept whatever terms he set out, he says, largely out of desperation.<br/>With prices failing to drop as quickly as predicted, demand is unlikely to fade soon.<br/>Research shared with BBC Newsnight suggests that the potential client base could be expanding.<br/>A new report commissioned by Fair4All Finance, a government-backed body that works on financial inclusion, looks at the lived experience of illegal moneylending in the UK. Researchers from fraud prevention firm We Fight Fraud and Lancaster University heard from 287 people across London, Preston, Port Talbot and Glasgow who had engaged with loan sharks and illegal moneylenders in the last three years, as well as eight illegal moneylenders.<br/>Current users said they were borrowing about \u00a33,000 on average, and clients were more likely to be lower-waged, full-time workers.<br/>D calls himself an \"enforcer\", referring to what happens if payments are missed or his messages go ignored.<br/>\"Then, the car outside is uninsurable. The windows and doors in the front of your house are pulled out and then it even goes up to you being badly beaten.\"<br/>He says that beatings are \"rare\", but admits to carrying out violent acts - breaking legs, smashing teeth or eye sockets, leaving people in hospital.<br/>When challenged on why this type of \"enforcement\" has to be so brutal, he says: \"It's personal. The way they've hurt me, I want to hurt them - physically and financially.\"<br/>In his own words, he is \"providing a service\" that relies on people \"helping him back\" after he has lent them money.<br/>Another active illegal moneylender we spoke to, \"M\", claims to have lent millions of pounds to clients over the past 20 years.<br/>He now runs a team that operates in different areas across the UK. He estimates that he has about \u00a32m out in loans at the moment. When a request for money above a certain value comes in, it gets referred up to him.<br/>M deals with \"the rich\" - people borrowing higher values to fund house renovations or to get a business out of difficulty. The interest rates rise with the risk attached and a guarantor is often required. <br/>Clients give him a form of guarantee in case they are not able to keep up with repayments. They might include a watch, a set of car keys, or pictures of photo IDs of their friends so he knows where to find them and chase the money.<br/>\"I'm constantly amazed who comes to me,\" he says. M claims to have funded birthday parties for well-known footballers who pay him back on payday.<br/>With many people unwilling to talk about debt, there is little data available about the number of lenders operating without a licence. In a report last year, the right-leaning think tank the Centre for Social Justice estimated that about one million people in England could owe money to illegal moneylenders.<br/>M dismisses what he describes as an outdated view of \"a bully boy business\". His collection tactics instead rely on fear. <br/>\"In this day and age, it's gone round to more being a nuisance,\" he says. \"If there's no contact, there might be pictures outside the house, or a knock on the neighbour's door asking where you are.<br/>\"That fear, that intimidation, that coercion is better to be used without an act.\"<br/>The recent research for Fair4All Finance did find that violence was rare, although the threat of it was common.<br/>One client told the report authors that the reality of the threat felt most serious when it came to their family. \"Stuff was going to happen to me, but not just me\u2026 I get threats for hurting my family\u2026 your mum is getting this, your brother is getting that.\"<br/>Another female client in Glasgow claims that she was forced to clean an office building for an illegal lender as an alternative way to pay back \u00a31,000 she had borrowed. Her debt would be reduced by about \u00a330 per shift.<br/>She described the experience as \"degrading\" and said she felt anxious and depressed. She now rarely leaves the house. <br/>\"Today, it is much more about someone getting inside your head than breaking your legs,\" says Cath Wohlers of the Illegal Money Lending Team, which prosecutes loan sharks in England.<br/>\"That can be anyone,\" she adds, pointing out that one in five people arrested by her team last year was female.<br/>Research also suggests that clients were more likely than the average person to have been refused credit elsewhere before turning to an illegal moneylender.<br/>Those with poor credit ratings are often limited to payday loans or other high-cost options. However, many of these - such as Wonga - have been regulated out of business, after concerns that they were causing severe financial distress to consumers.<br/>Jason Wassell, chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, suggests there is a risk that a smaller market \"can be taken too far\", with access to credit being reduced for people who might then go to friends and family, or even illegal lenders.<br/>But Mick McAteer, a former board member of the UK's financial watchdog, says that improving the regulation of \"subprime\"  lenders has protected people from being targeted with unaffordable products.<br/>He suggests that more efforts should be made to help people manage their debts and to boost alternative options such as community lenders or credit unions.<br/>According to the Bank of England, about 1.98 million people across the UK use credit unions. Some experts say there is a long way to go before these can plug the gap left by the exit of higher-cost lenders. Credit unions can't reach consumers as quickly and struggle to scale up as quickly as private companies due to a lack of access to technology.<br/>And as prices continue to rise, business for illegal money lenders like D and M shows no sign of slowing.<br/>But as Cath Wohlers warns: \"They will absolutely bleed you dry. It's just not worth it.<br/>\"If you are in debt, speak to your creditors and have conversations rather than borrowing more money to get out of it.\"<br/>Information and support: If you need help with debt, these BBC Action Line links may be helpful.

While other wine recommendation apps are now increasingly incorporating AI, such as market leader Vivino, the difference with Sippd is that it was based on the technology from the very beginning.<br/>New users start by completing an online wine quiz that analyses their wine preferences, such as colour, body, acidity, flavour, sweetness and price.<br/>Then the app's AI software does the \"heavy lifting\", generating thousands of personal wine recommendations that it calls \"taste matches\". These are rated in percentage terms, with scores of 100% aiming to be a perfect match.<br/>You can then start scanning wine lists or labels with your mobile phone's camera, and Sippd will give you your taste match scores for each bottle.<br/>Sippd then continues to learn when the user tells the app about his or her wine purchases. The aim is that the app's individualised recommendations get ever more accurate.<br/>\"Beginner drinkers are commonly overwhelmed with the number of choices they have when purchasing wine, and they often have no clue where to start learning about their preferences towards certain flavours, characteristics, and styles,\" he says.<br/>\"So our team developed the introductory quiz to provide novice drinkers with a simple, approachable way to enter the vast world of wine.\"<br/>Currently only available in the US, Maryland-based Sippd now has 100,000 users, and the app is free to use. The business makes its money by inviting people to buy recommended wines directly via the app for delivery.<br/>In Norway, tech entrepreneur Alexander Benz launched the first version of his AI-powered wine recommendation app Finp\u00e5Vin back in 2020. <br/>Mr Benz describes the AI as a \"living, breathing thing\" that learns from a users preferences, forever fine-tuning its recommendations.<br/>While the app currently only works with wines on sale at Norway's state-owned alcohol shops, Mr Benz is looking at the possibility of expanding overseas. <br/>He says he is also now aiming to train the AI \"to create unique personalities for wines based on their characteristics\", with the wines being able to \"talk\". Or at least for the AI to pretend to be a talking wine.<br/>\"I'm also developing a social network where wine takes centre stage, and with the help of AI, each wine shares social media content like pictures and text updates. Users can even chat with a wine to learn more about it.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>But what do professional wine experts think about such apps? The view is mixed.<br/>\"Overall I think they can be really good, if used properly,\" says John Downes, who is a master of wine - a holder of the top qualification in the industry. \"These apps connect with people, the guy in the street, in a way that the wine trade often fails at.<br/>\"They have a great potential in helping people along, and helping them to understand wine more.\"<br/>Wine writer Jamie Goode is far more critical, saying that wine apps \"often promise a lot, but fail to deliver\".<br/>\"The problem with trying to match wines to consumers is  - how do you you break down a wine into it component parts, and then understand their nature and qualities in a meaningful way that gives you data to play with in an app?\" he asks.<br/>\"And how can the app know about the tens of thousands of different wines made each year, with numerous vintage variations? If you want to find a more interesting bottle to drink, go to a genuinely good independent shop or website, which will have a carefully chosen range of wines.\"<br/>At Oxford University, Sandra Wachther is a professor of technology and regulation, where she researches the legal and ethical implications of AI. Given that she is a global leader in the study of AI, you might imagine that she would be all in favour of AI-powered wine apps. <br/>Instead she says it is an area where humans should really try to find a good bottle on their own, without reaching for the help of technology. \"When it comes to smells and taste, food or drink, we might want to enjoy grazing and tasting ourselves, rather than to follow recommendations [from an app].<br/>\"We might enjoy following our own eyes and noses, and value being surprised by a dish or beverage. While I can see many exciting roles for AI in our society, some areas of expertise might be best left to ourselves.\"<br/>Sippd's head of marketing, Alicia Ortiz, counters that the app is simply about helping people, especially beginner wine drinkers, \"so they no longer have to roll the dice, or spend unnecessary time researching, when they could be just sipping and enjoying\".<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The customer in question was moving in, a single man with his own place. <br/>Again and again, someone working for the removals firm passed Robson as she toiled and asked, \"Where do you want this, then?\"<br/>Three times she found herself having to explain: \"It's not my house, I'm not married to the man who's moving in, I'm just fixing the heating.\"<br/>Today, Ms Robson runs Your Energy Your Way, a firm that specialises in renewables, heat pumps, plumbing and similar services. She and other women in the industry argue that in 2023 the workforce behind many building trades should be far more diverse - and far too many people still assume that a woman couldn't be a plumber.<br/>According to data from the Office of National Statistics (ONS), the proportion of women plumbers is tiny, though the ONS estimates that their number grew from 2,700 (1.9%) in 2021 to 3,500 (2.4%) in 2022. <br/>\"Even 2.4% is woeful, isn't it?\" says Ms Robson. There is a similar proportion of women working in other building trades.<br/>The ONS cautions that its data is only an estimate, and is based on extrapolated results from a nationwide survey. Respondents included people who described themselves as plumbers or heating engineers. <br/>A government report published in January suggested that 5% of employees across 687 heating and cooling businesses were female, but the report noted: \"The sector may be slightly less diverse than these numbers imply.\"<br/>The Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers' Federation (SNIPEF) has said it wants to see women making up 10% of all apprentices in the trade. <br/>\"I worked for 17 years without meeting another woman. Then I started to look for them,\" says Hattie Hasan, founder of Stopcocks Women Plumbers, a plumbing company.<br/>She and Ms Robson point out the value of social media in connecting women in the trade around the country - from Facebook groups to TikTok - as well as in-person events such as those run by Stopcocks. The company also has a register of 750 women tradespeople in the UK, including 100 plumbers.<br/>Employers sometimes assume that including women in their advertising or claiming to be equal opportunities is enough but it isn't, argues Ms Hasan.<br/>To actually encourage women into a job, plumbing companies should consider how to cater to their needs - from menopause support, flexible working for single parents, separate toilets and personal protective equipment that fits women correctly, which keeps them safe from dust and other hazards at work.<br/>\"Some women we've spoken to have been told they have to buy their own clothes because it's more expensive for the company to buy it for them,\" says Ms Hasan.<br/>Women might find that working as a plumber is slightly easier at present if they are self-employed, suggests Ms Hasan, as that allows them to manage various commitments besides work on their own terms. She notes that she was forced to set up as self-employed trader herself, years ago, despite approaching multiple companies seeking work.<br/>Sovay Berriman is a self-employed plumber in Cornwall. She uses the business name \"Plumbmaid\", which she explains is not about being a maid in a subservient sense, but rather it is a reference to Cornish slang, where calling a woman \"some maid\" is a colloquial way of giving her especially high praise.<br/>\"A lot of male customers as well find it a relief,\" she says, of being a woman in the industry. \"They're just like, 'Oh, great!' - they're not having to be a bloke.\"<br/>While some are very supportive, Sovay Berriman has, like Ms Robson, faced her share of prejudice and says that the industry must work to push back against assumptions that tradespeople are, by default, men. <br/>She adds that she would be cautious about ascribing any particular attributes to either men or women in the industry, to avoid perpetuating stereotypes. It's not as if all women are better communicators than men, for instance.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>However, she points out that she feels her own skills have served her well. \"I have found that customers are open to how I explain things,\" she says.<br/>\"I don't know if that's about my gender but I do think potentially that's something that's more ingrained in society - that women are good at [communication].\"<br/>Given the shortage of plumbers and heating system installers in the UK, having an industry dominated by white men is a real problem - it means, by definition, that there are huge resources of \"untapped talent\" out there, says Vivien Kizilcec, consumer research manager at Energy Systems Catapult, a government-funded research group. <br/>Today, plumbing and heating are high tech trades that require knowledge of smart controls, renewable energy systems and efficient appliances. <br/>If more people were aware of this, a larger and more diverse cohort might take up the job, she suggests: \"With these new green technologies, you are getting a much wider range of skills.\"<br/>Parental encouragement can make a big difference, notes Aimee Holloran, a business development manager at Samsung Electronics. She specialises in advising customers about heat pumps, but started out as a plumbing apprentice. Her dad got her into all kinds of things boys typically do, she says, including riding motorbikes. And her mum suggested the plumbing apprenticeship.<br/>Some companies are setting targets for improving gender equality. LiveWest, a housing association in the south west of England, has appointed seven female apprentices in the last year, across various trades, for example. It now has 21 women among a 471-strong trades workforce.<br/>Earlier this year, the Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering (CIPHE) published advice for employers, suggesting that they make their diversity goals public, put together diverse interview panels when hiring people for jobs, and stick to inclusive language. Avoid obviously discriminating terms that continue to be used in job ads such as \"tradesman\", for example.<br/>\"There is certainly still a long way to go\" in terms of gender equality, says Kevin Wellman, chief executive of CIPHE.<br/>Ms Hasan agrees - and makes one final point. Women can bring new and improved approaches to plumbing, beyond simply expanding the workforce. People, she suggests, should stop questioning whether women can be merely \"as good as\" a man.<br/>\"Since when has the way men do things been the high bar that we all have to reach?\" she says, with a laugh. <br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

He had a hard time finding simple study tools, especially given his ADHD, so he started using ChatGPT to quickly generate and adapt study aids like charts of verb tenses. <br/>Developers have been quick to jump on this wave of interest, and there are now numerous apps that have drawn on open-source code to customise AI for language learners. These can be more appropriate for learners than general chatbots like the virtual companion Replika. <br/>Blanka Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, an associate professor of applied linguistics at the University of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 in Czechia, says that Replika has been useful for her students to practise informal English. <br/>But the conversations could become repetitive, language corrections were missing, and the chatbot would sometimes ask students for sexy pictures. \"This was quite abusive.\"<br/>In contrast, one of the specific language-learning chatbots is LangAI, launched in March by Federico Ruiz Cassarino. Mr Ruiz Cassarino drew on his own experiences of learning English after moving from Uruguay to the UK. His English skills improved dramatically from speaking every day, compared to more academic methods. He's now using his own app to work on his Italian.<br/>Many people get self-conscious about making mistakes in a language they barely speak, even to a tutor, Mr Ruiz Cassarino notes. But a chatbot won't judge you. And the new wave of generative AI is so advanced that it can cultivate AI penpals, which is how he sees his product.<br/>Rather than sticking to boring pre-scripted roleplays, with current AI \"you can speak about things that are interesting to you, which makes it feel like not as much of a chore to learn\".<br/>While many language learners are using popular chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard to practice, Mr Ruiz Cassarino believes that specific language-acquisition apps like his are useful.<br/>\"We worked really hard to make this well tailored for somebody who wants to learn languages,\" he says. The team customised LangAI's user interface to match users' vocabulary levels, added the ability to make corrections during a conversation, and enabled the conversion of speech to text.<br/>According to Mr Ruiz Cassarino, they're seeing some impressive retention numbers for an education app. Of users who try the app for around 10 minutes, roughly 45% will still be using it a month later. They're now focused on building the subscriber base of people willing to pay for unlimited use. <br/>Related to that, they're planning advancements like tracking of improved skills and the ability to personalise the chatbot's tone and personality (perhaps even to practise a language while conversing with historical figures).<br/>Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, who is also a member of the research project Language in the Human-Machine Era, has assessed the useability and usefulness of AI chatbots for students of foreign languages. This research suggests that AI chatbots are helpful for vocabulary development, grammar and other language skills, especially when they offer corrective feedback.<br/>To stay ahead of the trend, well-established language-learning apps have been integrating AI into their own platforms. Duolingo began collaborating with OpenAI in September 2022, using that company's GPT-4.<br/>It seems unlikely that AI chatbots will replace Duolingo altogether. Joy Ehonwa, an editor and writer in Lagos, mainly uses Duolingo to learn French.<br/>But lately she's also been using an AI chatbot developed in Nigeria to help with her French.<br/>She interacts with this chatbot, Kainene vos Savant, the way she would with \"an all-knowing human friend\". <br/>Ms Ehonwa explains, \"My questions revolve around 'why'? When I fail an exercise on Duolingo, the app is not great at helping me understand why the thing that was wrong, was wrong. So, I ask Kainene. Also, when I think a sentence should be a certain way and it isn't, I ask Kainene why and she helps me understand why it cannot be the way I expect it to be, as an English speaker.\"<br/>If the older language-learning platforms have weaknesses, so does AI-powered language learning. Users are reporting that chatbots are well versed in widely spoken European languages, but quality degrades for languages that are underrepresented online or that have different writing systems. Many of the AI language-learning apps are available for a limited set of languages.<br/>Even in common languages, the chatbots make errors - sometimes even inventing words. One problem is that they deliver text so confidently, it would be easy for a relatively new learner to take what they say as correct.<br/>Emily M Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington in the US, has concerns, \"What kind of biases and inappropriate ways of talking about other people might they be learning from the chatbot?\" Other ethical issues, such as data privacy, may also be neglected.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Still, Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 believes that there will be an enormous market for such technologies. And like a number of language learners, she points out that GPT-4, available with a paid subscription to ChatGPT, has made astonishing strides on accuracy.<br/>Though many teachers disagree, she believes, \"It's just a matter of time when artificial intelligence will replace us as teachers of foreign languages.\"<br/>While that may sound extreme, \"teachers will still have an important role as mentors and facilitators, particularly with beginner learners and older people since teachers have a strong understanding of the individual learning styles, language needs, and goals of each student.\"<br/>It will be key for language teachers to assess the added value of AI and their role in relation to it, as more sophisticated self-directed learning becomes possible. As Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 advises, \"Technology is here to stay, and we have to face it and reconsider our teaching methods and assessments.\" <br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But the mother-of-two has put her three-bed home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire on the market after her mortgage rate went up by nearly 300%. <br/>The 49-year-old was not able to extend her interest-only mortgage when it came to an end recently, and offers from other lenders were not within her financial reach.<br/>\"I got a letter saying my mortgage was going up from \u00a3289 to \u00a31,150 a month,\" she says. \"Now my mum is having to sell her house too and we are hoping to buy a house together in Norfolk because we can't afford anything in Hertfordshire.<br/>\"We don't want to move there but we have no choice.

I really don't want to have to sell it, I would feel terrible for the family, but where am I supposed to find that sort of money?\".<br/>Rachelle and her husband, who both work full-time, are also worried about the mortgage on their own home which comes up for renewal early next year.<br/>\"I have worked since I was 16 years old and we had got to a place where we could live comfortably and go on nice holidays but now I feel like we have gone back to worrying about every penny,\" she says.<br/>Richard, 61, from Cambridge, had to use all of his \u00a350,000 of savings to get the costs down when his fixed-rate mortgage ended last month.<br/>The IT worker is now on a tracker mortgage, which cost \u00a31,000 in fees to switch to.

Ms Teresi had taken her cue from the country singer Kid Rock, who weeks earlier produced a video of him shooting Bud Light cans with a submachine gun.<br/>The protests are part of a conservative reaction to the brand's seeming support for transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, who had shown off a personalised can of the beer in a social media post sponsored by the company.<br/>Bud Light, made by Anheuser-Busch, is now one of the latest US companies caught up in America's culture wars, joining a long list that has included Disney, the National Football League, Nike, Target and fast-food chain Chick-fil-A. <br/>\"Clearly, consumers have had it with corporate America trying to push values down on the people they supposedly are serving,\" said Will Hind, the executive director of Consumers' Research, a firm that has spearheaded campaigns targeting American Airlines and Levi's. \"People now act fairly swiftly when they see companies going 'woke' in ways that are noxious.\" <br/>Boycotts can be found on both sides of the political spectrum. <br/>Brands including sports apparel firm Under Armour and food company Goya faced backlash after their respective CEOs spoke out in support of former President Donald Trump. <br/>Whether or not these campaigns are effective, however, is up for debate. <br/>In Bud Light's case, it was unseated from its position as the best-selling beer in the US, with sales in the month leading up to 3 June down by nearly 25%. An analysis released by JP Morgan in May projected that Anheuser-Busch's earnings for the year would drop 26%, with sales not recovering fully until the 2024 fiscal year. <br/>Originally a slang term denoting awareness of social injustice and inequity, the word \"woke\" is used by right-wing Republicans as a pejorative umbrella that covers a variety of topics, from climate change to support for minorities. <br/>Evan Nierman, a PR crisis manager and author of a book entitled The Cancel Culture Curse, told the BBC that similar boycotts had had \"devastating\" financial impacts on US companies. <br/>\"The immediate financial impacts of boycotts are self-evident,\" he said. \"They could produce even greater losses when you calculate long-term damage to their reputation and loss of loyal consumers.\" <br/>Surveys suggest that Americans put considerable stock in a brand's stance on issues. <br/>One survey released by PR and marketing agency Method Communications in April suggests that 67% of Americans say their purchases are affected by a brand's stance, while 42% say they have stopped shopping with a particular brand because of its position on an issue. More than one-third of respondents say they pay attention to a firm's views on social issues. <br/>Some brands, experts say, face temporary losses only to emerge in a better position, championed by their supporters. <br/>Among them is Nike, which in 2018 saw detractors burning shoes and destroying other products in response to the company's support for quarterback Colin Kaepernick's racial justice protests. <br/>More recently, it angered some Americans with a campaign to promote leggings and sports bras using Dylan Mulvaney, the same activist at the heart of the Bud Light controversy. <br/>\"There were all kinds of bonfires that erupted about Nike for their stance. But it stuck to its guns, and you know what? Sales went up,\" said Tony D'Angelo, a public relations professor at Syracuse University. <br/>\"They made a commitment, and while that might disqualify them from some customers and some markets, it carved out a position for them in others,\" he added. <br/>While sales initially dipped in 2018, they rapidly bounced back. Within 12 months, stock prices were up over 60%. The company ended its most recent fiscal year with gross profits of $22bn (\u00a317bn) - a nearly 3% year-on-year increase. <br/>According to experts, the key factor that could ultimately determine how a brand weathers a woke-related boycott is how they respond to the initial fall-out. <br/>Bud Light, for example, came under intense criticism for its response to the Dylan Mulvaney controversy. After remaining silent on the issue for several days, CEO Brendan Whitworth said in a statement that the firm \"never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people\".<br/>\"We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer,\" the statement added. <br/>The response was widely seen as a blunder by experts in brand strategy and crisis communications. Mr D'Angelo characterised the brand's response as \"waffling\". <br/>\"You have to make a commitment,\" he said. \"If you waffle, then people are going to rightly question what they really stand for. That's exactly the position that you don't want to be.\" <br/>Mr D'Angelo's comments were echoed by Jordan McCauley, a member of Atlanta's LGBTQ+ community and founder of CelebrityPR, a firm that works with brands. <br/>\"Brands need to pick a position and stick to it. What hurt Bud Light was they seemed to flip-flop,\" he said. \"If they really supported Dylan Mulvaney, they would have stood up for her... to everyone who protested. But they backed down. Both sides then see this as two-faced and inauthentic.\" <br/>When asked by the BBC for comment on the boycott and its response, an Anheuser-Busch spokesperson said only that \"for the year\", Bud Light remains the top beer brand in the US in volume and dollar sales. <br/>Observers believe that boycotts of brands or firms are likely to increase in the coming years, partly as a result of the debate over \"woke\" ideology playing a key part in the upcoming 2024 US election. <br/>Mr Nierman said the country was likely to experience a \"boycott fever\". <br/>\"We absolutely should expect to see more campaigns,\" he said. \"They give everyday citizens the power to become activists, and to make a massive collective impact.\" <br/>Bud Light loses top spot in US after boycott<br/>Why Bud Light and Disney are under attack<br/>DeSantis warns 'buckle up' as he gets Disney power<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

When it announced the app's launch, the company said it would add a \"more robust search function\" along with improvements to the selection of recommended posts.<br/>Meanwhile the only way currently to fully delete a Threads profile is to delete the associated Instagram account, which many users would be reluctant to - another issue the company is looking to fix.<br/>When Threads was launched, Meta announced it planned to allow it to communicate with other social-media platforms, such as Mastodon, using something known as the fediverse.<br/>But this suggestion while welcomed by some, has met opposition.<br/>The idea of the fediverse is it is like email. Someone on Gmail can exchange emails with someone using Hotmail, for example, and the fediverse could be described as that idea applied to social media.<br/>At some point in the future Meta wants users to be able to use their Threads account to interact with other social-media platforms using ActivityPub - a protocol with the necessary programming code - such as Mastodon, WordPress or Reddit-alternative Lemmy.<br/>But some worry Threads threatens the idea of this system altogether, because of a practice big tech companies have utilised in the past - \"embrace, extend and extinguish\", when a company with a lot of resources extends what is possible from a new technology so drastically it becomes the new standard, leaving people with no choice but to use its platform.<br/>Mastodon chief executive Eugen Rochko dismissed these fears, saying Meta joining Threads was \"validation of the movement towards decentralised social media\" and \"a clear victory for our cause\".<br/>But concern among users has grown with over a hundred Mastodon communities joining what they call the \"fedipact\" - an agreement to block Meta from being able to access their community under any circumstances - so even when Threads does begin to support ActivityPub, users will not be able to access everything on the fediverse.<br/>One other feature coming to Threads at some point may also receive mixed reviews.

But now the real challenge - logging and preserving all of it - begins.<br/>You might recognise California-based Danny from his YouTube channel NoClip, which has produced making-of documentaries about top games including Final Fantasy, Rocket League, Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us and God of War.<br/>His latest project began when a contact got in touch to tip him off about a media company in San Francisco sitting on a huge collection of tapes that he'd definitely want to see. <br/>It was about to throw them all out, but Danny had other ideas. <br/>So he rented a truck, and was soon driving boxes and boxes of tapes back to his studio. And that got him thinking. <br/>\"Sure enough, there were more and more of these collections that were just kind of sitting in these buildings, and were eventually going to end up in their own landfills or were just going to rot away.\"<br/>After contacting those others, Danny's now got stacks of cardboard containers stuffed with tapes of different shapes and sizes, including some super-rare professional formats. <br/>On each tape is a nugget of video game history from the late 90s up to about 2010 - and it's very unlikely that you'll have seen it before. <br/>\"A lot of this stuff was before YouTube,\" says Danny. \"So it was before any of us had high-speed internet. <br/>\"There's stuff like videotapes that were sent to video game websites or TV channels that were never meant to be shown.\"<br/>From just a few tapes pulled from a \"couple of random boxes\", he's already uncovered an interview with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima and a tour of Call of Duty studio Infinity Ward featuring two developers who were later fired and went on to launch multiplayer shooter Apex Legends. <br/>Since then he's found other gems. <br/>\"A couple of days ago, I found a tape that had 'Nintendo Tour' written on it,\" he says. <br/>When he loaded it up, he found footage of an employee-only museum inside Nintendo's old USA headquarters.<br/>\"It's like 30 minutes of this room that none of us have ever seen, and doesn't exist any more,\" he says.<br/>Danny and the NoClip team plan to go through all the tapes and digitise them, turning the footage into files that can be uploaded online.<br/>But to do that they've had to level up their equipment inventory, as some of the tech needed to actually play some of the specialist tapes is rare and pretty ancient by today's standards. <br/>\"Finding ones that work today is incredibly difficult,\" says Danny. \"They cost a lot of money to buy and then shipping them is a nightmare because they weigh a ton.\"<br/>It's a challenge for a crowdfunded company that relies on donations to keep going, but Danny says dealing with different machines, cables and monitors is \"tough work\", but worth it. <br/>\"When you get the tape in these things and see it looking as good as it does, you can't buy that feeling,\" he says.<br/>\"Hidden in that collection, I know is going to be some stuff that's really going to shock and excite the larger video game world. <br/>\"So I'm excited for those big moments.\"<br/>And Danny, who's originally from Waterford, Ireland, says he's \"equally excited\" about smaller moments and awakening people's memories.<br/>\"Somebody's going to stumble across one of these videos, and it's going to be an old game they loved or they used to play with their cousin that they forgot about, right? <br/>\"If that person has that moment, where they watch that video, and they send the YouTube link to their cousin and go, 'do you remember when we used to play this?' <br/>\"That's why we do it.\"<br/>NoClip's putting all the footage on a dedicated YouTube channel and internet library archive.org. <br/>It's available to anyone, and he hopes other creators, documentarians and historians will use it in their projects. <br/>\"We hope that people interact with this stuff,\" says Danny.<br/>\"We've already seen people starting their own Twitch streams, where they watch a bunch of the videos or make their own YouTube video essays using this footage. <br/>\"But to me having a living, breathing archive, it's like a museum, there's no point having a museum if people aren't walking around it and interacting with the history that's there. <br/>\"We want people to check out the videos, share the videos, make their own art out of these videos and try and breathe new life into them.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Is Kick really a threat to Twitch?<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>A gaming safe space with screams, jumps and scares<br/>Noclip<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Meta, which also owns Facebook, said the app had 10 million users within the first seven hours of launch and more than 30 million by Thursday morning.<br/>Around 24 hours later, that figure had more than doubled. <br/>It still has some way to go to catch its main rival though. At 100 million, Threads' user base stands at less than a third of the 350 million users that Twitter is believed to have.    <br/>Some Twitter users have become disenchanted since billionaire Elon Musk took over. Thousands of jobs have been cut under his ownership and he has announced a number of changes to help generate revenue at Twitter.<br/>Other rivals have emerged like Mastodon and Bluesky but have struggled without an existing user base. <br/>Threads has capitalised on being linked to Instagram which has more than one billion users.<br/>People who sign up to Threads will display a link to their profile in the app in their Instagram profile but there is an option to hide this.<br/>In order to sign up for Threads, users must have an Instagram account. <br/>It is not possible to delete your Threads profile without deleting the associated Instagram profile.  <br/>However, deactivating your Threads profile will not deactivate your Instagram account. <br/>Deactivation will mean your Threads profile, your posts and interactions with others' posts won't be visible, Meta says.<br/>Since Threads' launch, Twitter has threatened the rival with legal action. <br/>A lawyer for the company accused Mr Zuckerberg of \"systematic, wilful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property\" to create Threads. <br/>Twitter claimed that Meta had hired former employees who \"had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information\". Meta has denied this.<br/>Users on Threads can post text of up to 500 characters, more than the 280 characters available on Twitter. Both apps allow people to post links, images and video.<br/>But the rules governing what content can be posted differ - nudity and not-safe-for-work (NSFW) explicit images are prohibited on Threads.<br/>Also unlike Twitter, there is no desktop version of Threads as yet.<br/>Can Threads make more money than Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter?<br/>Twitter threatens legal action over Threads app<br/>'Almost every influencer will be hopping on Threads'<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Experts say it marks a necessary correction in the bull run of Indian start-ups.<br/>\"Byju's is a company that has grown too fast too soon,\" says Shriram Subramanian, who heads an independent corporate governance research and advisory firm.<br/>Founded in 2011, Byju's launched its learning app in 2015. With 15 million subscribers by 2018, the edtech firm became a unicorn (valued at $1bn) amid much fanfare.<br/>It expanded substantially during the Covid-19 pandemic as students turned to online classes during lockdowns. But in 2021, it posted a loss of $327m, which was 17 times more than the previous year.<br/>Since then, the edtech giant has witnessed an extraordinary unravelling. Valued at $22bn (\u00a317.28bn) last year, Byju's has seen its valuation slashed to $5.1bn this year by Prosus NV, the company's biggest investor and shareholder.<br/>The company did not respond to the BBC's queries.<br/>\"After the pandemic, when children returned to schools there was going to be a downturn,\" Mr Subramanian said. \"But Byju's kept on growing and investors kept on putting money into it. They did not see the signs that there could be a downturn.\"<br/>Aniruddha Malpani, an angel investor and vocal critic of Byju's business model, says the company had \"paper fortunes\". <br/>\"There's a big gap between value and valuation,\" he said.<br/>With exponential growth during the pandemic, Byju's went on an acquisition spree in 2021, spending $2bn to acquire edtech start-ups and firms like WhiteHat Jr, Aakash, Toppr, Epic, and Great Learning. <br/>It soon surpassed digital payments platform Paytm to become India's most-valued start-up.<br/>Byju's channelled hundreds of millions into its marketing, roping in Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and football star Lionel Messi as its brand ambassadors. It became the main sponsor of the Indian cricket team and an official sponsor of 2022 FIFA World Cup. <br/>But in recent months, the company has been dogged by complaints as parents accused it of not fulfilling its promises - coercing them into buying courses they couldn't afford and then not providing the promised services. Some also said that the firm used predatory practices to exploit customers. <br/>Former employees complained of high-pressure sales culture and unrealistic targets. The firm has laid off thousands of employees in the past year in a bid to cut costs.<br/>Byju's has denied the allegations made by parents and its former staff. It has also been facing investigations from the government. <br/>In April, the firm's office in Bengaluru was raided by Indian authorities over suspected violations of foreign exchange laws. The company denied any wrongdoing and assured its workers that it had fully complied with the laws. <br/>In May, lenders to the company filed a suit in a US court, accusing it of defaulting on payments and breaching terms of the loan agreement, including months-long delays in releasing financial statements. The lenders also accused the company of diverting funds through its US-based subsidiary Alpha, a claim Byju's denied.<br/>In June, after reportedly missing an interest payment of nearly $40m, Byju's sued the lenders over alleged harassment.<br/>It also began another round of layoffs, firing nearly a thousand employees. There was more trouble waiting for the firm from its own auditors. <br/>Deloitte Haskins and Sells Llp quit as the company's auditors citing the delay in Byju's submitting its financial statements. The auditors said it impacted their ability to assess the company's books. <br/>This was soon followed by news that three of its board members had resigned, leaving just CEO Byju Raveendran, his wife Divya Gokulnath and brother Riju Raveendran on the board.<br/>The start-up is reportedly now in talks to restructure its debt load.<br/>Reports also said that there were calls for the CEO's resignation at a shareholders' meeting this week, but two investors at the company denied these claims.<br/>\"Byju's failed at holding itself to the standard expected of a company its size,\" said K Ganesh, a serial entrepreneur and angel investor who founded one of India's largest online grocers, BigBasket.<br/>The delay in filing financial statements was \"unacceptable and unconscionable\", he says.<br/>\"Most sectors that benefited from the pandemic and expanded rapidly are now facing headwinds because the return to normal has been more drastic than they expected,\" Mr Ganesh said. \"This is true for all companies in the edtech sector.\"<br/>Experts say the sector's potential was overestimated during the pandemic.<br/>\"Technology by itself will never work,\" Dr Malpani explains. \"You need it along with safe space for children where there is adult supervision, peer to peer learning.\"<br/>\"Byju's was essentially selling hardware, like its tablets, with study material that could be found online for free,\" he says.<br/>These start-ups were valued at a \"stratospheric, unrealistic level\" during the pandemic and are being valued at \"realistic levels now,\" Mr Ganesh said.<br/>He added that one of the reasons Byju's is at its current crossroads is the \"detrimental\" board structure of venture capitalist-funded companies.<br/>\"With just managers, founders and investors on board - each of whom is bound to protect their own interests -  there is nobody to protect the interests of the company. This is unlike a public listed company where regulatory rules ensure a set of independent directors on board and insist on an audit committee headed by an independent director,\" Mr Ganesh explained.<br/>Several experts, including Mr Ganesh, have been advocating that start-ups that reach a certain level should be told to work like public listed firms. <br/>At the shareholders' meeting, the company is said to have agreed to form an advisory committee consisting of independent directors to advise and guide the CEO on the composition of the board and the governance structure <br/>Mr Ganesh and Mr Shriram said the company could still course correct if it acknowledges its missteps and commits to immediate action on all fronts.<br/>But Dr Malpani believes Byju's has not shown the intent to do this.<br/>\"They need to conserve as much cash as possible which will give them a long runway and cut down on costs aggressively, more than just through layoffs,\" says Mr Shriram. \"Also, sell off some businesses to raise capital.\"<br/>Byju's has set a timeline of September end for the completion of its 2022 audit and December end for its 2023 audit. <br/>Analysts believe Byju's current situation will only have a positive short-term impact on India's start-up ecosystem.<br/>\"Due diligence, founders' rights, the need for an internal auditor, independent board members and terms and conditions of corporate governance, which were earlier glossed over, will become stricter,\" Mr Ganesh said. <br/>\"India has good corporate governance laws,\" Mr Shriram said. \"It is for the investors and other stakeholders to demand more from Byju's.\"<br/>Analysts say investors are used to handling bull and bear runs and have short memories when it comes to these dips. <br/>\"There'll be another [like this] in two years,\" Dr Malpani says.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

He said the news feed and the reposting were \"incredibly familiar\".<br/>But US copyright law does not protect ideas, so for Twitter to be successful in court it would have to prove that its own intellectual property, such as programming code, was taken.<br/>And in 2012 Meta was granted a patent for \"communicating a newsfeed\" - the system that displays all the latest posts when you use Facebook.<br/>In a move first reported by news outlet Semafor, Twitter attorney Alex Spiro sent a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday accusing Meta of \"systematic, wilful, and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual property\" to create Threads. <br/>Specifically, Mr Spiro alleged that Meta had hired dozens of former Twitter employees who \"had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential information\" that ultimately helped Meta develop what he termed the \"copycat\" Threads app. <br/>\"Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights, and demands that Meta take immediate steps to stop using any Twitter trade secrets or other highly confidential information,\" the letter says. <br/>\"Twitter reserves all rights, including, but not limited to, the right to seek both civil remedies and injunctive relief without further notice.\" <br/>BBC News, which has seen a copy of the letter, has contacted both Meta and Twitter for comment.<br/>Mr Musk said that \"competition is fine, cheating is not\" in response to a post on Twitter that referred to the legal letter.<br/>On Threads, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone posted that \"no one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee - that's just not a thing\". <br/>Sarah Kunst, managing director at venture capital firm Cleo Capital, told the BBC's Today programme Threads could offer a \"brand-safe environment\" for existing Instagram advertisers who \"feel they can allocate some budget and see what happens\".<br/>She added that while the app reaching 30 million users could be the result of an initial rush, it will likely see a steady increase in users.<br/>\"They've made it very easy to cross-post to other platforms like Instagram, so I think that we'll continue to see growth,\" she said.<br/>Both Mr Musk and Mr Zuckerberg have acknowledged the rivalry over Threads, which is linked to Instagram but works as a standalone app.<br/>As it launched in 100 countries, Mr Zuckerberg broke more than 11 years of silence on Twitter to post a highly popular meme of two nearly identical Spider-Man figures pointing at each other, indicating a stand-off.<br/>Shortly after, and as the word \"Threads\" trended globally on his platform, Mr Musk said: \"It is infinitely preferable to be attacked by strangers on Twitter, than indulge in the false happiness of hide-the-pain Instagram.\"<br/>Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a tweet on Thursday that while the platform, is \"often imitated\" it \"can never be duplicated\". <br/>Both Meta and Twitter have undertaken significant layoffs this year, with Meta announcing in April that it would cut staff levels by approximately 10,000. <br/>Twitter lost a large proportion of its 7,500 employees, as high as 80%, in waves of redundancies following Mr Musk's takeover last October.<br/>Can Threads make more money than Elon Musk\u2019s Twitter?<br/>'Almost every influencer will be hopping on Threads'<br/>30 million join Meta's Twitter rival - Zuckerberg<br/>Threads could cause real problems for Twitter<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The BBC's technology editor Zoe Kleinman and North America technology correspondent James Clayton have both tried out the app. Here are their first impressions.<br/>It was the middle of the night in the UK when my phone buzzed to let me know that Meta Threads, the new social network app I'd pre-ordered on the App Store, had been installed.<br/>Given the timing, I wasn't expecting much to be going on from a UK location. I already have an Instagram account so within three clicks I had a profile, and I selected to follow everybody I already follow on the photo-sharing app.<br/>Suddenly it was like I'd walked through the door to a great big house party. Loads of people were signing up, writing their first posts, responding to others and commenting on the new surroundings.<br/>I had dozens of followers in the first five minutes, and nearly 500 as I write this. (I've still got fewer than 300 on another Twitter alternative, the Jack Dorsey-founded text-based network, BlueSky, which I've been on for weeks.)<br/>If you're familiar with Twitter, you'll recognise the design of Threads instantly. Everything from the heart-shaped symbol to \"like\" a post, to the circle of arrows denoting the feature to repost, is the same.<br/>Some early complaints include the lack of a private messaging feature, no hashtags or trends to help navigate popular content, and no timeline curation options other than the ability to mute accounts or words, and block others.<br/>But I feel we should add the word \"yet\" - Threads is officially only a few hours old (although it is its second outing following an earlier version in 2019 that was discontinued. Perhaps the world wasn't yet ready, or sufficiently annoyed with the goings on at Twitter).<br/>What stands it apart from other Twitter rivals is the instant integration of this vast, ready-made Instagram community. Two billion people use the photo-sharing app and this offers an easy way for them all to land on another platform. <br/>This makes it instantly engaging, which will appeal hugely to advertisers, who I imagine will eventually fund it, although there will apparently be no ads for the first year.<br/>First impressions of Threads: can Meta do this? Is this not somehow plagiarism? <br/>The app looks almost identical to Twitter. The news feed, the reposting. It's all incredibly familiar. <br/>Mark Zuckerberg claims millions of people have signed up in the first few hours. You should always be sceptical when a tech boss says how many users have signed up to a platform. But it does feel like a lot of people are already on it.<br/>That's partly because it's connected to Instagram. Meta isn't creating an app from scratch. It's benefiting from its two billion Instagram followers that are giving it a massive shot in the arm. <br/>Platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon did not have this luxury. They started with zero users. <br/>But whether this is \"fair\" or not, Mr Zuckerberg doesn't care. He's copied other apps before to great success (Reels is a clone of TikTok) and he's happy to do so again.<br/>Knowing the power of celebrity, Mr Zuckerberg has also utilised famous names on Instagram and managed to get some of them on Threads, like Shakira and Gordon Ramsay. <br/>Mr Zuckerberg will be thrilled with the buzz around the app. When it comes to social media, it's all about the network effect. The more people use the app, the better the app is. <br/>When it comes to social media, the network effect can create a sort of tipping point. When so many of your friends or people you want to hear from are on a platform, you kind of feel you have to join. <br/>It's very, very hard to create a network effect on a social media platform. But when it works, it really works. The reverse is also true. When communities leave a social media platform, they can do so quickly - and it can be devastating. Think Myspace or Bebo. <br/>Let's go to some of the problems with Threads, though.<br/>Unlike Twitter, which has two feeds - a recommendations feed and an option just to see tweets from those you follow - Threads has just one feed that blends your followers and content it thinks you will want. That could get annoying. <br/>It doesn't seem to have desktop functionality yet - it doesn't work well on your computer. That's a shame. <br/>There doesn't seem to be any trending information, so it's hard to see what's going viral. <br/>And when it comes to verification, users can still buy their blue ticks for a monthly fee, just as you can with Twitter. <br/>Mark Zuckerberg described the app as an \"initial version\" - and that's what it feels like. It does the basics well. But this is a no-thrills app right now. <br/>That said, Meta's boss will be over the moon with how this has gone so far. Considering the bad press he's got over the years, he is reinventing himself as the adult in the room - the sensible tech billionaire who wants a friendly social media platform. <br/>You can tell this has riled Elon Musk. \"Thank goodness they're so sanely run,\" he tweeted sarcastically on Monday. <br/>But if Mr Zuckerberg was nervous that disaffected Twitter uses would spurn Meta's offer, so far, it looks like those fears were unfounded. <br/>And if that is the case, with an app that works perfectly well, if not spectacularly, that could be a real problem for Mr Musk.<br/>30 million join Meta's Twitter rival - Zuckerberg<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Around the world, governments that also oppose the popular technology are watching the showdown closely to see who will blink first.<br/>\"End-to-end encryption\", \"backdoors\" and \"client-side scanning\" - the biggest row in technology sounds very complicated.<br/>But really it comes down to a very simple question. Should technology companies be able to read people's messages?<br/>That is the crux of a row that has been brewing for years between Silicon Valley and the governments of at least a dozen countries around the world.<br/>WhatsApp, iMessage, Android Messages and Signal all use the super-secure system called end-to-end encryption.<br/>The technology means only the sender, at one end, and the receiver, at the other, can read messages, see media or hear phone calls. Even the app makers cannot access the content. <br/>In the past 10 years, end-to-end encrypted apps have become increasingly popular, with billions of people using them every day. <br/>Most governments and security agencies reluctantly accepted the technology's rise - until four years ago, when Mr Zuckerberg announced on stage the Messenger app and then Instagram would move to end-to-end encryption as standard. <br/>\"We're going to enable more than two billion people around the world to have their most personal conversations with each other privately,\" he said.<br/>Since then, Mr Zuckerberg and his army of engineers have slowly and quietly been cracking on with the project. The company is refusing to speak to reporters on the record about how the mammoth task is going or when the big switchover will be. \"By the end of 2023,\" is all it will say publicly.<br/>Meanwhile, the calls to stop the switchover or build in safeguards have been growing louder.<br/>Authorities in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, India, Turkey, Japan and Brazil - plus law-enforcement agencies such as Interpol - have criticised the technology.<br/>But no government in the democratic world has risked passing a law that will interfere with these popular apps - until now.<br/>Making technology companies build in some sort of technical backdoor to allow messages to be scanned for illegal material is one of the central tenets of the UK's wide-reaching Online Safety Bill, which looks likely to be passed into law in the near future.<br/>Police officers, if they can no longer ask Meta for the contents of people's messages, will miss out on a key source of evidence they regularly use to convict criminals or terrorists, the government says. <br/>And there is a particular concern about children being groomed online in secret.<br/>End-to-end encryption \"will be a huge boon to anyone who wants to hurt a child\", Home Secretary Suella Braverman wrote to Mr Zuckerberg on Monday.<br/>And on Wednesday, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has released a YouGov survey it commissioned, suggesting the British public wants police officers to be able to access people's messages, to protect children. <br/>Of the 1,723 adults surveyed across the UK, 73% said technology companies should, by law, have to scan private messaging for child sexual abuse and disrupt it in end-to-end encrypted environments.<br/>Most already scanned for child sexual abuse on their services, leading to many successful convictions, the NSPCC said.<br/>\"It is now clear that companies who wish to pit children's fundamental right to safety against the privacy rights of adults are out of step with the public and, ultimately, their user base,\" Richard Collard, at the charity, said.<br/>In response to the survey, a Meta spokesman said the company had \"developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse\" - age restrictions for contacting strangers, for example.<br/>Also on Wednesday, as if to highlight the passions on both sides of the debate, 68 prominent security and privacy researchers have published a letter saying the Online Safety Bill would effectively break end-to-end encryption.<br/>The bill puts the onus on tech firms to find a way to implement child safety measures whilst maintaining privacy for users but the experts say this is impossible. <br/>\"Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety,\" the letter says.<br/>\"This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online.\"<br/>It also sets a precedent for repressive regimes around the world to monitor and control what people are sharing, experts say.<br/>WhatsApp and Signal, meanwhile, have said they would rather remove their services from the UK than degrade end-to-end encryption security.  <br/>And to make matters worse for critics of the technology, Elon Musk announced, in May, he too was building end to end encryption, into Twitter messages.<br/>Switching to the technology is complex and expensive, as evidenced by Meta, but ultimately worth it tech bosses think.<br/>After years of data scandals, big tech sees it as key to rebuilding trust in its services.<br/>And in a happy coincidence, end-to-end encryption makes these embattled companies' tricky job of moderation a lot easier - if they cannot see what users are sharing, then neither can they police it.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But Mr Rodriguez said Canada's move in theory would apply to all platforms under the parent company. <br/>The loss of government advertising is a drop in the bucket for Meta, whose annual revenue in 2022 was over $116bn. But Mr Rodriguez said Canada is determined to send a message that it will not be intimidated. <br/>He added he hopes it will inspire others, including Canadian companies, to do the same. Media firms Quebecor and Cogeco, both based in the province of Quebec, said they will also be pulling advertisements from Meta.<br/>In a statement to the BBC, Meta said that Bill C-18 \"is flawed legislation that ignores the realities of how our platforms work\".<br/>\"Publishers actively choose to post on Facebook and Instagram because it benefits them to do so,\" the company said. <br/>The federal government says the bill is necessary to allow struggling news organisations to \"secure fair compensation\" for news and links shared on the tech platforms.<br/>A similar law to Bill C-18 was passed in Australia in 2021 but it was tweaked after Meta briefly blocked users in the country from sharing or viewing news on its platform. <br/>The blackout ended when the amendments were made, and Google and Meta have since negotiated more than 30 deals with Australian media companies.<br/>On Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he believes Canada has become a global test case for laws like Bill C-18. <br/>\"This is what they want to do, make an example of us,\" said Mr Trudeau of tech giants like Meta. <br/>\"Facebook decided that Canada is a small enough country that they could reject our asks,\" he said. \"They made the wrong choice by deciding to attack Canada.\" <br/>Mr Rodriguez said Canada has been discussing its law with other countries looking to pass similar legislation, like the UK, Indonesia and Brazil. <br/>Canada has also seen support from some US senators and pundits. <br/>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times by columnist Brian Merchant on Wednesday said \"Canada must absolutely not give in to the tech giants' tantrum\".<br/>US Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is leading the push for a similar bill in Washington DC, has also spoken up in support of Canada's law. <br/>Meta has already begun restricting access to news to a small percentage of Canadians in tests and said it plans to implement a full blackout in the coming weeks. <br/>On Instagram, some users have reported seeing a message that reads \"In response to Canadian government legislation, news content can't be viewed in Canada\" when trying to view news content. <br/>Canada is going to war with Google, and it might not win<br/>Google to scrap local news in Canada over law<br/>Facebook and Instagram to block news in Canada<br/>Facebook reverses ban on news in Australia<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It is a \"very extreme and unprecedented tactic\" which is \"already failing\", said Dr Chowdhury.<br/>Twitter saw advertisers flee amid worries about Mr Musk's approach to content moderation rules, affecting its revenue. <br/>When Mr Musk spoke to the BBC in April, he said the company was now \"roughly breaking even\", claiming most of its advertisers were returning. <br/>The limit on tweets saw some journalists, who use Twitter to find information for live reporting and verification of stories, confronted with the curbs. <br/>Bel Trew, chief international correspondent for The Independent, tweeted that limits to how many tweets she could read on the platform had left her at a \"complete loss\" while reporting on Sunday.<br/>And a reporter in the US city of Baltimore was left unable to view tweets from the local police department's Twitter account in the wake of a shooting that left two people killed and a further 28 injured.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The vast majority of its revenue comes from advertising, just like Meta and Google.<br/>When users go onto the platform, they're served ads. The more time they spend on Twitter, the more ads they see. The equation is pretty simple. That's the business. <br/>However, Elon Musk has traditionally eschewed advertising. Tesla famously doesn't do ads.<br/>In 2019 he tweeted \"I hate advertising\".<br/>And yet he's bought a company that is totally reliant on it.<br/>So, Elon Musk is desperate to generate different revenue streams.<br/>This is not just a business decision. He believes that advertisers hold too much power over social media companies when it comes to moderation.<br/>Advertisers can, and have, pulled their money from Twitter.<br/>Advertisers don't want their ads placed next to racist or extremist content. And so Twitter's main revenue stream also has an influence over how much \"free speech\" is allowed on the platform.<br/>Mr Musk told me in April that \"most\" of the advertisers had returned after initially pausing their ads from Twitter after his takeover.<br/>However Mr Musk has another plan to turn Twitter into a profitable company.<br/>He wants Twitter to make money out of the vast amount of data it holds.<br/>Platforms like Twitter and Reddit hold a treasure trove of hundreds of billions of real human conversations - an incredible resource for AI companies.<br/>Large language models (LLMs), can learn from these interactions, and work out how to respond to questions in more human-like ways.<br/>But platforms like Twitter and Reddit want to be paid for the use of their data in this way.<br/>In April, Reddit's chief executive Steve Huffman told the New York Times that he was unhappy with what AI companies were doing.<br/>\"The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\" he said. \"But we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\"<br/>At around the same time, Elon Musk said that Microsoft was \"ripping off the Twitter database, demonetizing it (removing ads) and then selling our data to others\".<br/>On Saturday it became clear how frustrated Mr Musk was getting.<br/>\"We were getting data pillaged\" he said.<br/>\"Almost every company doing AI, from start-ups to some of the biggest corporations on Earth, was scraping vast amounts of data,\" he said.<br/>And so, by restricting usage, Elon Musk is hoping to prevent its data from being pulled into LLMs. He wants to negotiate with AI companies and get paid for the content that they take.<br/>But there could be other factors at play too, and it goes back to another one of his attempts to decrease Twitter's reliance on advertising revenue.<br/>Mr Musk is desperate for people to pay for Twitter.<br/>For months, he's been trying to push people towards Twitter Blue. There's been some carrot, giving Twitter Blue members a blue tick and verification, and some stick - removing verification from users that don't pay.<br/>But Twitter Blue has not been what Elon Musk had hoped. People aren't paying up in their droves.<br/>Perhaps he's looking at another way to get users to open their wallets. In future, if want access to unlimited tweets, perhaps you'll have to pay a monthly fee?<br/>Whatever Mr Musk is thinking, one thing is clear though. Restricting tweets is not good for advertisers.<br/>The limits are \"remarkably bad\" for users and advertisers already shaken by the \"chaos\" at Twitter, Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester, told Reuters.<br/>This is perhaps the most perplexing part of Elon Musk's restrictions. He has recently hired Linda Yaccarino to be Twitter's chief executive.

Several free speech experts hailed it as a significant lawsuit. <br/>It was the first instance of a social media company suing the government over its content takedown orders, often criticised for being arbitrary and opaque.<br/>Last week the Karnataka High Court dismissed Twitter's case and imposed a fine of 5m rupees ($61,000; \u00a348,000) on the company for not complying with the contested orders for over a year. Twitter has more than 24 million users in India, by one estimate.<br/>The verdict has left many digital rights experts worried. <br/>\"The judgement reposes untrammelled power in the state to issue blocking orders that bypass procedural safeguards,\" said Radhika Roy, a lawyer and spokesperson for digital rights organisation Internet Freedom Foundation.<br/>She added that the court could have countered \"the rampant misuse\" of law to take down unfavourable content on the internet, rather it has ended up legitimising it.<br/>Commentators are apprehensive about Twitter's next move. Will the social media giant comply with the take down orders or appeal the judgement?<br/>The case was filed by Twitter under its previous leadership. Under new owner Elon Musk, the company has complied with takedown orders.<br/>After a recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US, Mr Musk said that the company has no choice \"but to obey local government laws\" or it risks getting shut.<br/>The recent judgement raises concerns about free speech since the government has been accused of increasing its censorship of online content in recent years. Federal minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has said that all foreign Internet platforms had to comply with Indian laws.<br/>In 2022, India blocked 3,417 Twitter URLs, while only eight Twitter URLs had been blocked in 2014.<br/>Twitter's case was that 39 orders of the federal government to block access to accounts and tweets went against the law - India's information technology law allows the government to block online content that \"threatens the security of the state\" and public order among other things.<br/>It said that the government does not have the power to block accounts, but only specific tweets. <br/>Further, it said that the orders had not been properly reasoned and that the grounds required for taking down content had not been made out by the government. <br/>Also, users whose accounts and tweets were being blocked had not been informed by the government.<br/>The government argued that the orders were legal. It said that the contested content was posted by \"anti-India campaigners\" and that if such users were informed about the action being taken against them, they may choose to tweet anonymously and cause more harm. <br/>Therefore, it was appropriate that only Twitter was informed about these orders, the government said.<br/>Since the law requires these orders to be confidential, it is not clear which accounts and tweets were challenged. <br/>However, one instance cited in the judgement reveals that at least one account had posted tweets related to the farmer's protest in 2021 against new farm laws brought by the government.<br/>The court has now said that the government has the power to block not just tweets, but entire accounts as well. <br/>These orders could extend indefinitely. It also added that when the government is blocking content, the user does not necessarily have to be informed.<br/>Under the law, users or the company hosting the information - such as Twitter - have to be given a notice and a chance to be heard in court before a blocking order is passed. <br/>In cases of emergency, the government can immediately block a website and give notice later.<br/>The orders also need to have details in writing about why a website needed to be blocked. Twitter argued that this was missing in the orders the government had passed.<br/>However, the court looked at the tweets and accounts in contention and found that they had \"outrageous\", \"treacherous and anti-national\" content which could threaten national security and public order. It said that these details had been shared with Twitter.<br/>Further, the court accepted the government's arguments that detailed reasons had been shared with Twitter in review meetings that had taken place before the blocking order was passed. <br/>The court also said that giving notice to users was discretionary. The users in question \"comprised of terrorists\" and \"foreign adversaries who intend to discredit and destabilise India and jeopardise national security on communal lines\". <br/>Thus, it accepted the government's argument that it was \"not desirable\" to issue notice to such \"anti-India\" campaigners.<br/>Experts say that this judgment limits users' ability to defend their right to free speech. <br/>Users \"won't be given a chance to defend themselves before a blocking order is passed\" said Sachin Dhawan, a programme manager at digital rights research body Centre for Communication Governance. <br/>\"Even after an order is passed, they will be left in the dark about why their content has been blocked\" he added.<br/>As a result, \"a process which was already shrouded in secrecy will become even more opaque,\" he said. Mr Dhawan added that this undermined \"basic due processes\" such as giving a \"notice and a hearing\" to an aggrieved party.<br/>However, another significant case pending before the Delhi High Court may lead to a different outcome.<br/>It relates to a satirical dowry calculator website being blocked by the government without the website's founder being given a notice.<br/>In May last year, the High Court directed the government to provide the founder a copy of the order and give him a hearing, during which the ban was upheld. The court is now hearing whether the website can be blocked.<br/>The court's order to provide a copy to the founder \"inspires hope\", Ms Roy from Internet Freedom Foundation said.

Meanwhile, accounts with \"verified\" status are currently limited to 10,000 posts a day.<br/>The tech billionaire initially set stricter limits, but he changed these within hours of announcing the move.<br/>Mr Musk said the temporary limits were to address \"extreme levels of data scraping and system manipulation\".<br/>He did not explain what was meant by system manipulation in this context.<br/>\"We were getting data pillaged so much that it was degrading service for normal users,\" Mr Musk explained on Friday, after users were presented with screens asking them to log in to view Twitter content. <br/>The move was described as a \"temporary emergency measure\".<br/>It is not totally clear what Mr Musk is referring to by data scraping, but it appears he means the scraping of large amounts of data used by artificial intelligence (AI) companies to train large language models, which power chatbots such as Open AI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard.<br/>In simple terms, data scraping is the pulling of information from the internet. Large language models need to learn from masses of real human conversations. But the quality is vital to the success of a chatbot. Reddit and Twitter's huge trove of billions of posts are thought to be hugely important training data - and used by AI companies.<br/>But platforms like Twitter and Reddit want to be paid for this data. <br/>In April, Reddit's chief executive Steve Huffman told the New York Times that he was unhappy with what AI companies were doing.<br/>\"The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,\" he said. \"But we don't need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.\"<br/>Twitter has already started charging users to access its application programming interface (API), which is often used by third party apps and researchers - which can include AI companies.<br/>There are other potential reasons for the move too.<br/>Mr Musk has been pushing people towards Twitter Blue, its paid subscription service. It's possible he is looking at a model where users will have to pay to get a full Twitter service - and access to unlimited posts.<br/>Signalled by a blue tick, \"verified\" status was given for free by Twitter to high-profile accounts before Mr Musk took over as its boss. Now, most users have to pay a subscription fee from $8 (\u00a36.30) per month to be verified, and can gain the status regardless of their profile.<br/>According to the website Downdetector - which tracks online outages - a peak of 5,126 people reported problems accessing the platform in the UK at 16:12 BST on Saturday.<br/>In the US, roughly 7,461 people reported glitches around the same time. <br/>Initially, Mr Musk announced reading limits of 6,000 posts per day for verified accounts, 600 for unverified accounts, and 300 for new unverified accounts.<br/>In another update Mr Musk said \"several hundred organisations (maybe more) were scraping Twitter data extremely aggressively\". <br/>He later indicated there had been a burden on his website, saying it was \"rather galling to have to bring large numbers of servers online on an emergency basis\".  <br/>A server is a powerful computer that manages and stores files, providing services such as web pages for users.<br/>Adam Leon Smith from BCS, the UK's professional body for IT, said the move was \"very odd\" as limiting users' scroll time would affect the company's advertising revenue.<br/>Mr Musk bought the company last year for $44bn (\u00a335bn) after much back and forth. He was critical of Twitter's previous management and said he did not want the platform to become an echo chamber.<br/>Soon after taking over, he cut the workforce from just under 8,000 staff to about 1,500.<br/>In an interview with the BBC, he said that cutting the workforce had not been easy.<br/>Engineers were included in the layoffs and their exit raised concerns about the platform's stability.<br/>But while Mr Musk acknowledged some glitches, he told the BBC in April that outages had not lasted very long and the site was working fine.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Elon Musk's unexpected BBC interview... in 90 seconds<br/>Twitter restores blue tick to high profile accounts<br/>Musk on layoffs, misinfo and sleeping in the office<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

If so, are they processing it?\" she said. <br/>The bill will give the communications regulator Ofcom powers to fine tech companies, block access to sites and also see the introduction of criminal liabilities for executives of companies who fail to co-operate.<br/>Iain Corby from the Age Verification Providers Association said he welcomed the bill's requirements but \"with five million adult websites, the government still needs to give the regulator better powers to enforce at scale before the bill is finalised\".<br/>Concerns have also been raised that the requirement for users to provide official documentation could lead to discrimination against certain socio-economic groups, who are more likely to lack these documents.<br/>Mr Scully rejected criticism that the legislation could mean vital sexual health education content could be blocked.<br/>\"I want to reassure people working in those areas that they won't be harmed by this bill,\" he said. <br/>Mr Scully added it would be up to Ofcom to decide on the guidelines in determining \"what is and what isn't available for under-18s\".<br/>Children are being exposed to online pornography from as young as nine, according to research. By the age of 13, around 50% had been exposed to it.<br/>Some teenagers simply lie about their date of birth to get round age restrictions on websites.<br/>Mr Scully said the amendments would \"stop the majority of children - who don't look for VPN or don't look for other ways around this - just to be able to almost trip over access to pornography, which is the case at the moment\".<br/>The UK has been grappling over how to protect social media users, and in particular children, from harmful content without damaging free speech.<br/>New measures will also seek to hold top executives personally responsible for keeping children safe on their platforms, the government said, after agreeing to toughen the bill in January with the prospect of jail time for tech bosses.<br/>Other changes to the bill will allow regulators to obtain information on a child's social media use if requested by a coroner, which will help bereaved families understand any possible influence of online activity in their death.<br/>The tech industry, including firms like Apple, have criticised sections of the Online Safety Bill, particularly provisions that could be used to make messaging services break end-to-end encryption in order to scan for child abuse material.<br/>The government said there would be no further amendments to that part of the bill before it is voted on. <br/>The bill, which is possibly months away from being passed, will be voted on next week in the House of Lords.<br/>Wikipedia refuses Online Safety Bill age checks<br/>WhatsApp and messaging apps against 'surveillance'<br/>WhatsApp: Rather be blocked than weaken security<br/>Can age verification stop children seeing porn?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

That legislation passed two years ago, but Australian lawmakers made changes after Meta briefly blocked users in the country from sharing or viewing news on its platforms. <br/>The blackout ended when the amendments were made, and Google and Meta have since negotiated more than 30 deals with Australian media companies.<br/>Google had previously called the Canadian law \"unworkable\" in its current form and proposed amendments. Both Google and Meta have held talks with the government about the legislation. <br/>But in response, the Canadian government has said the legislation will help provide fair compensation to struggling news outlets and has argued it is necessary \"to enhance fairness in the Canadian digital news market\".<br/>Speaking to CTV News on Thursday afternoon, the minister responsible for the file, Pablo Rodriguez, said he was surprised by Google's move, noting they had had \"conversations as recent as this morning\".<br/>The Canadian parliament's independent budget watchdog found news organisations could receive as much as C$329m ($248m; \u00a3196m) per year from digital platforms.<br/>But many of the same media associations and outlets that championed the bill may now face a threat to their businesses, as Google fuels a significant portion of web traffic to Canadian news outlets.<br/>At the Globe and Mail, for instance, Google accounts for 30% of the traffic, publisher Phillip Crawley told parliament last month. For Le Devoir, a prominent French language publication, Google drives 40% of its traffic, with nearly 30% coming from social media.<br/>Google did not specify how long its ban on local news links would last, or whether Canadian users would be shown links to stories about Canada from publishers not based in the country.<br/>\"We have now informed the government that when the law takes effect, we unfortunately will have to remove links to Canadian news from our Search, News and Discover products in Canada,\" Google said in a blog post.<br/>\"We don't take this decision or its impacts lightly and believe it's important to be transparent with Canadian publishers and our users as early as possible,\" it said.<br/>In a statement to the BBC, Google Canada's policy team said the government had \"not given us reason to believe that the regulatory process will be able to resolve structural issues with the legislation\". <br/>But in its post on Thursday, the company said it planned \"to participate in the regulatory process\" and to \"continue to be transparent with Canadians and publishers as we move forward\".<br/>News Media Canada, which represents hundreds of news organisations across the country and had lobbied in favour of the law, said it still believed there was a \"viable path forward\".\"Rather than demonstrating their extraordinary market power by withholding access to timely, accurate news for Canadians, this is a time for all stakeholders to act in good faith, as responsible corporate citizens, and engage actively in the regulatory process to ensure that regulation is balanced, predictable and fair,\" it said.<br/>With additional reporting from Natalie Sherman. <br/>Facebook blocks news content in Australia<br/>Facebook and Instagram to block news in Canada<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

What happens now?<br/>As president of La Presse, a leading French-language publication in Quebec, Pierre-Elliott Levasseur says he tried for years to negotiate payment agreements with tech giants, which he believed were sucking up data and ad dollars on the strength of news articles his 220-odd staff were supplying.<br/>\"For years and years they've flat-out refused,\" he told the BBC. <br/>He had hoped a new law, known as the Online News Act, would change that - and lead to an influx of funds that could be invested in the business.<br/>The law - which is aimed at Google and Meta - requires tech firms to negotiate payment agreements with news outlets. If the two sides cannot reach a deal, the country's broadcast regulator can force them into arbitration.<br/>An independent parliamentary budget watchdog has estimated that measure could generate more than C$300m (\u00a3180m; $226m) in total annually - or funding for roughly 30% of a typical newsroom's operations. <br/>But instead of a windfall, La Presse - and every other Canadian news organisation - is now facing a potential blackout, as the tech giants pledge to block links to news articles on their platforms rather than comply.<br/>Meta, which had opposed the proposal from the start, said it would start blocking news sites for Canadian users over the next few months.<br/>Google has struck payment agreements with news providers in Europe, Australia and elsewhere and had appeared willing to negotiate. <br/>But this week it called Canada's current law \"unworkable\" and said it would remove links to Canadian news from its search, news and discover products in the country once the act goes into effect in six months. <br/>It says it currently has agreements with more than 150 Canadian news organisations, and estimated its traffic helped news websites earn C$250m a year.<br/>\"We're willing to do more,\" the company said, referring to payments. \"We just can't do it in a way that breaks the way that the web and search engines are designed to work, and that creates untenable product and financial uncertainty.\" <br/>Before the law was passed this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had dismissed the threats from the tech firms to pull news. <br/>\"The fact that these internet giants would rather cut off Canadians' access to local news than pay their fair share is a real problem, and now they're resorting to bullying tactics to try and get their way. It's not going to work,\" he said earlier in June.<br/>Tech industry organisations have compared the effort to a \"shakedown\", but Mr Levasseur says no one in media is looking for a handout.<br/>\"We're asking to have an opportunity to negotiate a fair commercial agreement,\" he says. \"The only reason that they haven't done it is because they're monopolies.\" <br/>How the dispute gets resolved could prove a pivotal moment in a wider fight, as countries around the world, including Indonesia, South Africa, India, the UK and the US consider similar measures. <br/>The sums under discussion amount to a tiny drop in the bucket compared to the tens of billions of dollars made by the tech giants each year - but could prove a lifeline for journalism, says Courtney Radsch, director of the Center for Journalism and Liberty at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think-tank.<br/>\"There is an increasing consensus around the world that Google and Facebook ... should pay for the news that they use,\" she says. \"People realise that there is a need to protect journalism as a fundamental pillar of democracy.\"<br/>Canada modelled its rule on a measure that Australia passed in 2021. That law sparked similar objections, prompting Meta to impose a brief news blackout.<br/>But after some changes to the bill the two companies ended up negotiating more than 30 deals with publishers worth more than $130m (A$200m), according to economist Rodney Sims, who led Australia's competition agency, which developed the law.<br/>He says he expects the companies to behave similarly this time - even though at Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been pushing the platform away from news in favour of more personal content.  <br/>\"Facebook just hates the whole thing,\" he conceded. But \"you can't have effective search with no news and I think Facebook is going to find ... that it is very hard for them to give you your feed without any news,\" he says. <br/>\"It's what makes their service complete.\"<br/>But others are warning that how the fight plays out in Canada could be different. <br/>Phillip Crawley, chief executive of the Globe and Mail, which has licensing deals in place with Google, Meta, Apple and others, pointed to broader changes in search that are under way, such as the rise of chatbots like ChatGPT, which generate answers, not a list of links, in response to user questions.<br/>With more countries considering such measures, the companies also have bigger incentive to fight, he says. <br/>\"The world is in a different place,\" says Mr Crawley, who spoke in support of the bill, while raising concerns that certain powers granted Canada's broadcast regulator could threaten the independence of the press. <br/>\"So I don't think the model in Australia is one that that we should be guided by too much. That was then. This is now.\"<br/>Google and Meta say that Canada's law differs from Australia's in key ways. Notably, in Australia, companies could satisfy regulators without doing deals with everyone. In Canada, there's no such out. It also regulates more types of content.<br/>Google says it tried - with little effect - to raise its concerns about the bill with the government before it passed. Though the government came back to the bargaining table after the law passed, those \"overtime\" discussions were too late to fix the problems, a source at the company told the BBC.<br/>Michael Geist, a Canadian tech legal scholar and noted critic of the bill, says the government has miscalculated given the shifts in Meta's business. <br/>The company has said the proportion of adults using Facebook for news fell by about a third between 2016-2022, from 45% to 30%, and its surveys of users show they want to see less news on the platform. <br/>\"Why did the government not read the room?\" Mr Geist said. \"Facebook is not bluffing - they would like to get out of news.\"<br/>Google has said it will continue to participate in the regulatory process, which could take months to resolve and leaves many newsrooms facing more turmoil. <br/>At the Globe and Mail, which now gets two-thirds of its revenue from subscriptions, Google accounts for 30% of the traffic, Mr Crawley told parliament last month. <br/>For Le Devoir, a major French-language publication, Google drives 40% of its traffic and nearly 30% comes from social media.<br/>Meta has already moved to cancel the deals it has in place with publishers in Canada - which can be worth millions of dollars, according to reports - as well as a funding it had provided to a fellowship programme. <br/>Mr Levasseur conceded that a blackout would have an impact at La Presse, which is profitable and funded largely by advertising and reader donations. But he said he believed the publication, which reaches roughly 1.4 million readers each day, would adjust, as it has to the other upheavals in the news business that tech giants have unleashed.<br/>\"When we put an end to the [print] paper, advertising revenue was decreasing. Now it's increasing,\" he says. \"We were able to adjust then and I'm sure we'll be able to adjust in the future.\"<br/>Google to scrap local news in Canada over law<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But is that about to change?<br/>Rival Kick has been grabbing headlines after it poached Amouranth and xQc - two of the biggest names on the Amazon-owned platform.<br/>Those high-profile converts have inspired other smaller streamers to follow them, helped by the promise of a larger revenue cut.<br/>But not everyone is sold and opinions are mixed on the new contender.<br/>It's fair to say Twitch has had a tough time recently - some streamers quit in protest against plans for stricter advertising rules, forcing it to abandon them. <br/>And then Amouranth and xQc went Kick in the space of 48 hours. <br/>It's reported that xQc was tempted over with a deal worth about $100m (\u00a378m), although he's been broadcasting on both platforms since.<br/>If you jump on Kick, which launched officially in January this year, you'll notice it looks quite similar to Twitch.<br/>There's the usual rolling page of livestreams which you can filter by category or game title.<br/>And there's a chat, where fans can talk to each other and the person streaming, with options to subscribe or tip the creator.<br/>Payment's one of the big differences - and big attractions - of Kick.<br/>At the moment, it's letting all content creators keep 95% of their subscription revenue, compared with Twitch's 50% and YouTube's 70%.<br/>For streamers like Dean, also known as AverageDad, that makes switching a no-brainer. <br/>\"Why would you not want to make twice as much as you would do on another platform?\" he says.<br/>Dean, from Greater Manchester, left Twitch earlier this month and now streams on various platforms including Kick, which he says will give Twitch \"a good old fight\".<br/>\"At the end of the day, content creators want to earn revenue every which way possible,\" he says.<br/>Another big difference between the two is Kick's more relaxed content policy.<br/>And its gambling streams, which feature prominently on the platform and regularly appear in its top three categories, have been a talking point.<br/>Kick was co-founded by Ed Craven, the billionaire owner of crypto and betting site Stake.com, which sponsors Alfa Romeo's F1 team and Everton FC. <br/>Stake.com was among the accounts banned during a recent gambling crackdown on Twitch.<br/>And some streamers, including hugely popular Pokimane, have said Kick's gambling links put them off. <br/>She told her 9.3m followers moving there would compromise her morals.<br/>But Dean dismisses much of the criticism as a \"smear campaign\" because there are still some gambling streams on Twitch, such as slots and roulette streams from companies officially licensed to run them.<br/>Some streamers have also described Kick as a much more toxic place, particularly for LGBT streamers and people of colour.<br/>They say there are fewer options for dealing with harassment and abuse.<br/>Nic from Leeds, otherwise known as NicScreams, says streaming on Kick wouldn't feel safe for her or her community of followers. <br/>She's also concerned about some big signings, such as Adin Ross, who was banned from Twitch.<br/>\"He's quite openly homophobic. He's openly misogynistic,\" says Nic.<br/>\"There are videos of him abusing random women on the internet because of their appearance, and nothing happens. <br/>\"He's still streaming and he's still making money on Kick.\"<br/>BBC Newsbeat's asked Kick for a comment and is waiting for a response.<br/>It's fair to point out the platform isn't a content free-for-all - it does have rules against drug use and discrimination.<br/>And xQc already got in trouble for copyright infringement when he streamed Batman film The Dark Knight on his channel.<br/>But Nic says she feels that Twitch does more to combat hate speech.<br/>\"If there's something going down in my stream that I don't like or my community doesn't like, I know that Twitch will look out for me,\" she says.<br/>Nic admits, though, that it's become more difficult to make money on Twitch, and she's gone from streaming full-time to part-time.<br/>Although it backed down on proposals to restrict its advertising options, it's still going ahead with another unpopular measure.<br/>It's banning simulcasting, where streamers go live on multiple different platforms at the same time- something many do to boost their income.<br/>\"Financially, it's terrible to stream on Twitch,\" says Nic.<br/>\"You work really hard to turn this into a career or a side hustle, and it feels like Twitch are very quick to take that away.\" <br/>So will Kick be a success? <br/>Lots of people have pointed out similarities to Mixer - a short-lived Twitch competitor launched by Microsoft.<br/>It made headlines by signing up popular Fortnite streamer Ninja in a deal worth $50m (\u00a339m), but was shut down just a year later. <br/>So far, perhaps not surprisingly, Amouranth and xQc's Kick follower numbers are nowhere near their Twitch levels.<br/>But Dean is convinced Kick will be different.<br/>\"I think the conversation is going to be more about Kick in five years than Twitch,\" he says.<br/>Kick's suggested more big names like xQc will be joining, and Dean thinks that can only help streamers like him. <br/>\"When xQc stops streaming, all of his viewers don't just go, 'I'm not going to watch any more',\" he says.<br/>\"They'll hang out for a little bit, maybe look at some different streams, which is going to allow that platform to constantly evolve and constantly move forward.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>How Zelda is helping fans with their mental health<br/>Has Diablo IV completed its quest for inclusivity?<br/>Why is Reddit full of pictures of John Oliver?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It's impacting social life.\"<br/> Matt, who spent time in care, and now divides his time between work and helping raise awareness of the issues care-leavers face, told the BBC he had never lived in a home with broadband internet.<br/>Katharine Sacks-Jones, chief executive of children-in-care charity Become, said many care-leavers face \"a real struggle\".<br/>Many can't afford wi-fi \"or they can't buy the data on their phone, because they're having to pay for other things like feeding themselves, like keeping the electricity on,\" she said.<br/>People who can't afford data have told the BBC of difficulties managing benefits claims, or having to juggle work hours with library opening hours to fill in forms or print things out.<br/>Lewa had to make savings after her husband passed away.<br/>She decided to \"cut back on the wi-fi to focus on gas and electricity and water costs,\" but she didn't realise how data-dependent her family had become.<br/>\"Life is a struggle. If you want data for four people it costs a lot and I was always overdrawn,\" she said.<br/>\"There were times when I was literally crying because it was a struggle, especially when your doctor says fill in the form online.<br/>\"You need that data. It's vital. I have days when I can't go out and I need to do shopping online. How do you get by if you can't access the internet? It's hard.<br/>\"I had to send my kids to my neighbour so they could do their homework. I felt embarrassed.\" <br/>Eventually the Good Things Foundation, which works to end digital exclusion, provided the family with a tablet and data.<br/>The chair of the committee, Baroness Stowell, told the BBC that people without internet often missed out on online deals \"so in a cost-of-living type situation, they are also not getting the full advantage of any savings\", she said.<br/>The report accused the government of taking its \"eye off the ball\".<br/>It said the government's ambition to make the UK a \"technology superpower\" and boost economic growth was being undermined by high levels of digital exclusion.<br/>That includes people who can't afford internet, who can't access it, or lack key digital skills.<br/>It said the scale of the problem was a \"direct consequence of political lethargy\".<br/>The increasing use of AI in the delivery of public services may also mean that digitally excluded people may face bias.<br/>People who do not post online often may be poorly represented in the datasets - often drawn from material on the internet - used to train such systems, the report said.<br/>Peers want to see more use of social tariffs. At the moment just 5% of the 4.3 million households who are eligible use them.<br/>The committee also called for the chancellor to remove VAT from social tariffs \"straight away\", Baroness Stowell said, adding that she wanted Ofcom to do better in forcing companies to advertise these tariffs.<br/>The report comes as Chancellor Jeremy Hunt met with regulators including Ofcom about the cost-of-living crisis.<br/>Following that meeting Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom's chief executive, said it would be \"urging telecoms firms to take immediate steps to raise awareness of social tariffs\".<br/>Till Sommer from the Internet Service Providers Association agreed with the committee that a new digital inclusion strategy was \"long overdue\".<br/>He said there was a \"real commitment\" across the broadband sector to help more people get online through social tariffs and support for people struggling. <br/>But he said there were areas where \"only the government can move the dial - including reviewing VAT on broadband\".<br/>Can social tariffs get you cheaper broadband?<br/>One million cancel broadband as living costs rise<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

However, it is incredibly difficult for me to be able to do this and it does cross my mind whether I can carry on doing it,\" she said. <br/>\"These kinds of barriers don't need to be there because we've got the technology - it's just we're not legally allowed to use it for public meetings.\"<br/>The LGA surveyed around a third of local authorities in England and found 95% of these wanted the power to be able to reintroduce virtual or hybrid meetings. No council wanted to hold fully virtual meetings but the overwhelming majority wanted hybrid options for councillors who needed them. <br/>Previous LGA research also found when hybrid meetings took place during the pandemic, public attendance increased.  <br/>Joe Harris, vice-chairman of the LGA, said: \"Good decision-making needs people who reflect the range of experiences, background and insight that exist in their communities.  <br/>\"However, councillors are restricted by law to attend council meetings in person, which can deter a range of people including full time professionals, parents of young children, carers, workers and disabled people from stepping forward to represent their communities.\"<br/>A consultation on remote council meetings closed in June 2021, with a government response expected shortly. <br/>A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesman said: \"While remote meetings gave councils the necessary flexibility to support businesses and communities during the Covid-19 pandemic, we believe physical attendance at meetings remains important, not just to build strong working relationships but to deliver good governance and democratic accountability. <br/>\"It is right that councillors regularly meet and debate in person so that communities can hold their council to account.\"<br/>Jackie Weaver: Don't stop virtual council meetings<br/>Jackie Weaver and the new era for council meetings<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

She contacted the BBC via children's charity the NSPCC in order to highlight her findings.<br/>\"Since AI-generated images became possible, there has been this huge flood\u2026 it's not just very young girls, they're [paedophiles] talking about toddlers,\" she said. <br/>A \"pseudo image\" generated by a computer which depicts child sexual abuse is treated the same as a real image and is illegal to possess, publish or transfer in the UK.<br/>The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead on child safeguarding, Ian Critchley, said it would be wrong to argue that because no real children were depicted in such \"synthetic\" images - that no-one was harmed.<br/>He warned that a paedophile could, \"move along that scale of offending from thought, to synthetic, to actually the abuse of a live child\".<br/>Abuse images are being shared via a three-stage process:<br/>Some of the image creators are posting on a popular Japanese social media platform called Pixiv, which is mainly used by artists sharing manga and anime. <br/>But because the site is hosted in Japan, where sharing sexualised cartoons and drawings of children is not illegal, the creators use it to promote their work in groups and via hashtags - which indexes topics using key words. <br/>A spokesman for Pixiv said it placed immense emphasis on addressing this issue. It said on 31 May it had banned all photo-realistic depictions of sexual content involving minors.<br/>The company said it had proactively strengthened its monitoring systems and was allocating substantial resources to counteract problems related to developments in AI.<br/>Ms Sheepshanks told the BBC her research suggested users appeared to be making child abuse images on an industrial scale.<br/>\"The volume is just huge, so people [creators] will say 'we aim to do at least 1,000 images a month,'\" she said.<br/>Comments by users on individual images in Pixiv make it clear they have a sexual interest in children, with some users even offering to provide images and videos of abuse that were not AI-generated. <br/>Ms Sheepshanks has been monitoring some of the groups on the platform. <br/>\"Within those groups, which will have 100 members, people will be sharing, 'Oh here's a link to real stuff,'\" she says. <br/>Many of the accounts on Pixiv include links in their biographies directing people to what they call  their \"uncensored content\" on the US-based content sharing site Patreon. <br/>Patreon is valued at approximately $4bn (\u00a33.1bn) and claims to have more than 250,000 creators - most of them legitimate accounts belonging to well-known celebrities, journalists and writers. <br/>Fans can support creators by taking out monthly subscriptions to access blogs, podcasts, videos and images - paying as little as $3.85 (\u00a33) per month.<br/>But our investigation with Octavia Sheepshanks found Patreon accounts offering AI-generated, photo-realistic obscene images of children for sale, with different levels of pricing depending on the type of material requested.<br/>One wrote on his account: \"I train my girls on my PC,\" adding that they show \"submission\". For $8.30 (\u00a36.50) per month, another user offered \"exclusive uncensored art\".<br/>The BBC sent Patreon one example, which the platform confirmed was \"semi realistic and violates our policies\". It said the account was immediately removed.<br/>Patreon said it had a \"zero-tolerance\" policy, insisting: \"Creators cannot fund content dedicated to sexual themes involving minors.\"<br/>The company said the increase in AI-generated harmful content on the internet was \"real and distressing\", adding that it had \"identified and removed increasing amounts\" of this material.<br/>\"We already ban AI-generated synthetic child exploitation material,\" it said, describing itself as \"very proactive\", with dedicated teams, technology and partnerships to \"keep teens safe\".   <br/>AI image generator Stable Diffusion was created as a global collaboration between academics and a number of companies, led by UK company Stability AI.<br/>Several versions have been released, with restrictions written into the code that control the kind of content that can be made.<br/>But last year, an earlier \"open source\" version was released to the public which allowed users to remove any filters and train it to produce any image - including illegal ones.<br/>Stability AI told the BBC it \"prohibits any misuse for illegal or immoral purposes across our platforms, and our policies are clear that this includes CSAM (child sexual abuse material). <br/>\"We strongly support law enforcement efforts against those who misuse our products for illegal or nefarious purposes\".<br/>As AI continues developing rapidly, questions have been raised about the future risks it could pose to people's privacy, their human rights or their safety.<br/>Jo [full name withheld for security reasons], GCHQ's Counter Child Sexual Abuse (CCSA) Mission Lead, told the BBC: \"GCHQ supports law enforcement to stay ahead of emerging threats such as AI-generated content and ensure there is no safe space for offenders.\" <br/>The NPCC's Ian Critchley said he was also concerned that the flood of realistic AI or \"synthetic\" images could slow down the process of identifying real victims of abuse.<br/>He explains: \"It creates additional demand, in terms of policing and law enforcement to identify where an actual child, wherever it is in the world, is being abused as opposed to an artificial or synthetic child.\"<br/>Mr Critchley said he believed it was a pivotal moment for society.<br/>\"We can ensure that the internet and tech allows the fantastic opportunities it creates for young people - or it can become a much more harmful place,\" he said.<br/>Children's charity the NSPCC called on Wednesday for tech companies to take notice. <br/>\"The speed with which these emerging technologies have been co-opted by abusers is breath-taking but not surprising, as companies who were warned of the dangers have sat on their hands while mouthing empty platitudes about safety,\" said Anna Edmundson, the charity's head of policy and public affairs.<br/>\"Tech companies now know how their products are being used to facilitate child sexual abuse and there can be no more excuses for inaction.\"<br/>A spokesman for the government responded: \"The Online Safety Bill will require companies to take proactive action in tackling all forms of online child sexual abuse including grooming, live-streaming, child sexual abuse material and prohibited images of children - or face huge fines.\"<br/>App to block child abuse images gets \u00a31.8m EU cash<br/>Child abuse images found on VR headsets, data shows<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The Online Safety Bill poses a serious threat to this protection, and could put UK citizens at greater risk.<br/>\"Apple urges the government to amend the bill to protect strong end-to-end encryption for the benefit of all.\"<br/>But the government told the BBC that \"companies should only implement end-to-end encryption if they can simultaneously prevent abhorrent child sexual abuse on their platforms.<br/>\"We will continue to work with them to seek solutions to combat the spread of child sexual abuse material while maintaining user privacy.\" <br/>The Online Safety Bill, currently going through Parliament, contains powers that could enable communications regulator Ofcom to direct platforms to use accredited technology to scan the contents of messages.<br/>The government said these powers would only be used as \"a last resort, and only when stringent privacy safeguards have been met\".<br/>Recently Home Office ministers have also been highly critical of Facebook's roll-out of the tech for messaging.<br/>Several messaging platforms, including Signal and WhatsApp, have previously told the BBC they will refuse to weaken the privacy of their encrypted messaging systems if directed to do so.<br/>Signal said in February that it would \"walk\" from the UK if forced to weaken the privacy of its encrypted messaging app.<br/>Apple's statement now means that some of the most widely used encrypted apps oppose this part of the bill.<br/>The government argues it is possible to provide technological solutions that mean the contents of encrypted messages can be scanned for child abuse material. <br/>The only way of doing that, many tech experts argue, would be to install software that would scan messages on the phone or computer before they are sent, called client-side scanning.<br/>This, critics say, would fundamentally undermine the privacy of messages.<br/>In 2021 Apple announced plans to scan photographs on people's iPhones for abusive content before they were uploaded to iCloud but these were abandoned after a backlash. It has now clearly signalled its opposition to any measure that weakens the privacy of end-to-end encryption.<br/>Its announcement comes as the digital civil liberties campaigners The Open Rights Group sent an open letter to minister Chloe Smith.<br/>The letter, signed by more than 80 national and international civil society organisations, academics and cyber-experts, says: \"The UK could become the first liberal democracy to require the routine scanning of people's private chat messages, including chats that are secured by end-to-end encryption. <br/>\"As over 40 million UK citizens and 2 billion people worldwide rely on these services, this poses a significant risk to the security of digital communication services not only in the UK, but also internationally.\"<br/>Element, a British tech company whose products using E2EE are used by government and military clients, has previously told the BBC measures in the bill that are seen to weaken the privacy of encrypted messages would make customers less trustful of security products produced by UK firms. <br/>There is a growing expectation, the BBC has learned, that changes may be made to part of the bill which critics say could be used to mandate scanning. These could be included in a package of amendments to be revealed in the coming days.<br/>But it is not clear what the detail of those changes might be, or if they will satisfy the concerns of campaigners. <br/>Minister attacks Meta boss over encryption plan<br/>Signal to quit UK if law changes on encryption<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

the law in England and Wales.<br/>Amendments to the Online Safety Bill being tabled on Tuesday will remove the requirement for prosecutors to prove perpetrators intended to cause distress to secure a conviction.<br/>Sharing deepfake porn is also being criminalised for the first time.<br/>Both offences will be punishable by up to six months in prison. <br/>This would rise to two years if intent to cause distress, alarm or humiliation, or to obtain sexual gratification could be proved.<br/>Those who share an image for sexual gratification could also be placed on the sex offenders' register.<br/>\"Revenge porn\" is sharing an intimate image without consent. \"Deepfake porn\" involves creating a fake explicit image or video of a person.<br/>Revenge porn was criminalised in 2015 but up until now prosecutors had to prove there was an intention to cause humiliation or distress.<br/>TV personality Georgia Harrison, whose ex-partner Stephen Bear was jailed earlier this year for posting intimate footage of her on his OnlyFans account, was among those to call for a change to the legislation.<br/>The Love Island star said she was grateful for the support she had been given. <br/>\"The reforms to the law that have been passed today are going to go down in history as a turning point for generations to come and will bring peace of mind to so many victims who have reached out to me whilst also giving future victims the justice they deserve,\" she said.   <br/>The government announced its intention to legislate last year, and the amendments are part of the Online Safety Bill, which is due to be voted on by MPs later this month before it becomes law.<br/>Justice Secretary Alex Chalk said: \"We are cracking down on abusers who share or manipulate intimate photos in order to hound or humiliate women and girls.<br/>\"Our changes will give police and prosecutors the powers they need to bring these cowards to justice, safeguarding women and girls from such vile abuse.\"<br/>Deepfakes have been increasing in recent years with a website that virtually strips women naked receiving 38 million hits in the first eight months of 2021.<br/>Research shows one in seven women and one in nine men aged between 18 and 34 have experienced threats to share intimate images,.<br/>More than 28,000 reports of disclosing private sexual images without consent were recorded by police between April 2015 and December 2021.  <br/>The overhaul of intimate image law builds on previous amendments. <br/>A detailed review by the Law Commission recommended reforming measures protecting against intimate image abuse.<br/>Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs welcomed the news and said the changes would \"hold perpetrators to account for this insidious form of abuse\".<br/>She said: \"Intimate image abuse causes significant distress to victims and survivors and often exists as part of a wider pattern of abuse that continues offline.\"<br/>Ruth Davison, chief executive of the domestic abuse charity Refuge, pointed to the \"woefully low\" conviction rates for intimate image abuse.<br/>\"The amendments to the Online Safety Bill will make it easier to prosecute perpetrators of intimate image abuse, ensuring justice and better protections for survivors,\" she said.<br/>However, others have highlighted that more needs to be done to fully address image-based abuse.<br/>Honza \u010cervenka, a lawyer at McAllister Olivarius, said the changes were welcome but pointed out there were likely to be \"jurisdictional issues\".<br/>\"Some of these websites may not be easily traceable, others may be hosted in countries specifically chosen for their lax laws when it comes to online harm and harassment,\" he told the BBC.<br/>\"Very often, victims become aware of images resurfacing months or even years after their apparent takedown.\"<br/>Rani Govender, senior child safety online policy officer at the NSPCC, said it was a positive move but big tech firms needed to be held more accountable for what was posted on their platforms.<br/>\"More needs to be done if the Online Safety Bill is to tackle the creation and sharing of child sexual abuse material which takes place on industrial levels,\" she said.<br/>\"The government should act today by closing a loophole in the legislation that will let tech bosses off the hook if they fail to address the way their products contribute to child sexual abuse.\" <br/>Trauma of deepfake porn can be 'life-shattering'<br/>Sharing pornographic deepfakes to be illegal<br/>Inside the secret world of

I wouldn't wish it on anybody.\"<br/>New figures released by Police Scotland show there has been a 68% increase in fraud since 2018, with 17,000 cases recorded last year - the vast majority online. <br/>Mr Donald's company Robop, now based in Arisaig, makes robot peregrine falcons for bird pest control.<br/>The firm sold its products in 17 countries but was hit hard by Covid.<br/>At 16:30 one Friday afternoon in December 2020, Mr Donald was agonising over the company's future when he received a call.<br/>It set in motion one of the worst experiences of his life.<br/>Speaking in a well-to-do Edinburgh accent, the caller said they were from a joint banking task force and had discovered fraud in his account.<br/>\"I was under a lot of stress at the time and the way it was done was very, very sophisticated,\" said Mr Donald.<br/>His gut instinct told him something was badly wrong.<br/>But when he asked questions, it became clear that the caller knew a great deal about him and his business. Mr Donald felt their answers were plausible.<br/>Using another phone, he tried to call his bank but couldn't get through. <br/>The caller then ramped up the pressure.<br/>\"They basically said we've got this time window because there's a gap between what we see on our system and what you see on yours, so we need to get this wrapped up as quickly as possible,\" said Mr Donald.<br/>\"They asked me to transfer money out of an account into another account in my name.<br/>\"This wasn't a five minute affair. This went on for an hour.<br/>\"I felt incredibly stupid afterwards but at the time it seemed like the only option that I had.\"<br/>A friend put Mr Donald in touch with the Cyber and Fraud Centre Scotland and six weeks later, his bank refunded the missing money.<br/>The centre's chief executive Jude McCorry said others had not been so fortunate.<br/>She added: \"We've seen a recent fraud where there was \u00a3700,000 transferred on a property deal that went to the wrong account. <br/>\"That involved an individual rather than a company. It was huge and the investigation is still going on.<br/>\"Instead of always reacting to these crimes, we need to look at how we prevent it.\"<br/>Senior officers at Police Scotland believe cyber-crime is massively under-reported and the latest figures represent the tip of the iceberg.<br/>It has become such a challenge that the detection rate for fraud has halved in recent years and now stands at roughly 16% of cases.<br/>Assistant Chief Constable Andy Freeburn warned that Scottish crime groups were increasingly involved.<br/>He said: \"What we have seen over the last year is emerging serious and organised crime groups operating in that space, trying to exploit the Scottish public through cyber, through fraud, and we are now actively working against those gangs.<br/>\"This is something we are not going to arrest our way out of. There is a significant threat in Scotland.<br/>\"We are having successes in identifying people and recovering money in consultation with banking and financial partners.<br/>\"But we are also improving our prevention messaging, making it very clear to the public how they can help themselves by not giving out details, making sure their software is up to date on their computers and reporting anything suspicious to us.\"<br/>Police Scotland is investing an additional \u00a34.3m in its cyber-crime strategy to buy new equipment and provide training for all of its operational officers.<br/>The force has also drawn up a protocol to ensure its use of new technology is ethically sound.<br/>Meanwhile, Mr Donald said the public need to know how sophisticated cyber scams can be.<br/>He added: \"My simple advice is, have your bank's fraud line on speed dial on your mobile phone. <br/>\"And, for the bank, to please answer when people call these numbers.\"<br/>Cyber and Fraud Centre Scotland<br/>Contact Police Scotland<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Could the attack, and the response from the Russian government, be rewriting the narrative of who the good guys and bad guys are in cyber-space?<br/>Camaro Dragon, Fancy Bear, Static Kitten and Stardust Chollima - these aren't the latest Marvel film superheroes but the names given to some of the most feared hacking groups in the world.<br/>For years, these elite cyber teams have been tracked from hack to hack, stealing secrets and causing disruption allegedly under orders from their governments.<br/>And cyber-security companies have even created cartoon images of them.<br/>With dots on a world map, marketeers at these companies regularly warn customers about where these \"advanced persistent threats\" (APTs) are coming from - usually Russia, China, North Korea and Iran.<br/>But parts of the map remain conspicuously empty.<br/>So why is it so rare to hear about Western hacking teams and cyber-attacks?<br/>A major hack in Russia, unearthed earlier this month, might provide some clues.<br/>From his desk overlooking the Moscow Canal, the cyber-security worker watched as strange pings began to register on the company wi-fi network.<br/>Dozens of staff mobile phones were simultaneously sending information to strange parts of the internet.<br/>But this was no ordinary company.<br/>This was Russia's biggest cyber company Kaspersky, investigating a potential attack on its own employees.<br/>\"Obviously our minds turned straight to spyware but we were pretty sceptical at first,\" chief security researcher Igor Kuznetsov says.<br/>\"Everyone's heard about powerful cyber tools which can turn mobile phones into spying devices but I thought of this as a kind of urban legend that happens to someone else, somewhere else.\"<br/>After painstaking analysis of \"several dozen\" infected iPhones, Igor realised their hunch had been right - they had indeed unearthed a large sophisticated surveillance-hacking campaign against their own staff.<br/>The type of attack they had found is the stuff of nightmares for cyber defenders.<br/>The hackers had invented a way to infect iPhones simply by sending an iMessage that automatically deletes itself once the malicious software is injected into the device.<br/>\"Wham, you're infected - and you don't even see it,\" Igor says.<br/>The victims' entire phone contents were now being pinged back to the attackers at regular intervals. Messages, emails and pictures were shared - even access to cameras and microphones. <br/>Keeping to Kaspersky's long-standing rule of not pointing fingers, Igor says they are not interested in from where this digital espionage attack was launched. <br/>\"Bytes don't have nationalities - and anytime a cyber-attack is blamed on a certain country, then it's done with an agenda,\" he says.<br/>But the Russian government is less concerned about that. <br/>On the same day Kaspersky announced its discovery, Russian security services put out an urgent bulletin saying they had \"uncovered a reconnaissance operation by American intelligence services carried out using Apple mobile devices\". <br/>The Russian cyber-intelligence service made no mention of Kaspersky but claimed \"several thousand telephone sets\" belonging to both Russians and foreign diplomats had been infected.<br/>The bulletin even accused Apple of actively helping in the hacking campaign. Apple denies it was involved. <br/>The alleged culprit - the United States National Security Agency (NSA) - told BBC News it had no comment.<br/>Igor insists Kaspersky did not coordinate with the Russian security services and the government's bulletin took them by surprise. <br/>Some in the cyber-security world will be surprised by this - the Russian government had appeared to be issuing a joint announcement with Kaspersky, for maximum impact, the kind of tactic increasingly used by Western countries to expose hacking campaigns and loudly point fingers.<br/>Only last month, the US government issued a joint announcement with Microsoft - Chinese government hackers had been found lurking inside energy networks in US territories. <br/>And this announcement was swiftly and predictably followed by a chorus of agreement from America's allies in cyber-space - the UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand - known as the Five Eyes.<br/>China's response was a rapid denial saying the story was all part of a \"collective disinformation campaign\" from the Five Eyes countries. <br/>Chinese Foreign Ministry official Mao Ning added China's regular response: \"The fact is the United States is the empire of hacking.\"<br/>But now, like Russia, China seems to be adopting a more aggressive approach to calling out Western hacking.<br/>State-run news outlet China Daily has warned foreign-government-backed hackers are now the country's biggest cyber-security threat. <br/>And that warning came with a statistic from Chinese company 360 Security Technology - it had discovered \"51 hacker organisations targeting China\".<br/>The company did not respond to requests for comment.<br/>Last September, China also accused the US of hacking a government-funded university responsible for aeronautics and space research programmes.<br/>\"China and Russia have slowly figured out the Western model for cyber exposure is incredibly effective and I think we are seeing a shift,\" Rubrik Zero Labs head and former cyber intelligence worker Steve Stone says.<br/>\"I'll also say I think that's a good thing. I have zero issue with other countries revealing what Western countries are doing. I think it's fair play and I think it's appropriate.\" <br/>Many brush off the Chinese charge of the US being the empire of hacking as hyperbole - but there is some truth in it.<br/>According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), the US is the only tier-one cyber power in the world, based on attack, defence and influence. <br/>Tier two is made up of:<br/>The National Cyber Power Index, compiled by researchers at the Belfer Centre for Science and International Affairs, also deems the US the world's top cyber power. <br/>The paper's lead researcher, Julia Voo, has also noticed a shift.<br/>\"Espionage is routine for governments and now it's so often in the form of cyber-attacks - but there's a battle of narrative going on and governments are asking who is behaving responsibly and irresponsibly in cyber-space,\" she says.<br/>And compiling a list of APT hacking groups and pretending there are no Western ones is not a truthful depiction of reality, she says. <br/>\"Reading the same reports about hacking attacks from only one side adds to a general ignorance,\" Ms Voo says.<br/>\"A general education of the public is important, because this is basically where a lot of tensions between states are going to be playing out in the future.\" <br/>And Ms Voo praises the UK government for publishing its inaugural transparency report into National Cyber Force operations. <br/>\"It's not super-detailed but more than other countries,\" she says.<br/>But the lack of transparency could also stem from cyber-security companies themselves. <br/>Mr Stone calls it a \"data bias\" - Western cyber-security companies fail to see western hacks, because they have no customers in rival countries.  <br/>But there could also be a conscious decision to put less effort into some investigations.<br/>\"I don't doubt that there's likely some companies that may pull the punch and hide what they may know about a Western attack,\" Mr Stone says.<br/>But he has never been part of a team that deliberately held back.<br/>Lucrative contracts from governments such as the UK or US are a major revenue stream for many cyber-security companies too.<br/>As one Middle Eastern cyber-security researcher says: \"The cyber-security intelligence sector is heavily represented by Western vendors and greatly influenced by their customers' interests and needs.\"<br/>The expert, who asked to remain anonymous, is one of more than a dozen volunteers regularly contributing to the APT Google Sheet - a free-to-view online spreadsheet tracking all known instances of threat-actor activities, irrespective of their origins.<br/>It has a tab for \"Nato\" APTs, with monikers such as Longhorn, Snowglobe and Gossip Girl, but the expert admits it is pretty empty compared with tabs for other regions and countries. <br/>He says another reason for the lack of information on Western cyber-attacks could be because they are often stealthier and cause less collateral damage.<br/>\"Western nations tend to conduct their cyber operations in a more precise and strategic manner, contrasting with the more aggressive and broad attacks associated with nations like Iran and Russia,\" the expert says.<br/>\"As a result, Western cyber operations often yield less noise.\"<br/>The other aspect to a lack of reporting could be trust. <br/>It is easy to brush off Russian or Chinese hacking allegations because they often lack evidence. <br/>But Western governments, when they loudly and regularly point the finger, rarely, if ever, provide any evidence either.<br/>Did hackers start this steel factory fire in Iran?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Cyril had pitched to over 100 investors and was unable to secure any funding.<br/>Having faced so many rejections, he tells me how difficult it was to find funding.<br/>\"I had to deal with a lot of no's and eventually I realised I was not the only black entrepreneur finding it hard to grow my business,\" he says.<br/>\"The founders we work with now need three things: capital, connections and access. We work to provide all of those things.\" <br/>Talking to the founders, it's clear that the scope of Black Seed goes far beyond just investing in companies - it's about community too. <br/>\"There are certain challenges that black entrepreneurs face that their peers don't. We speak to many start-up founders who have no mentor or network of support,\" says Yvonne Nagawa.<br/>The 30-year-old left her full time job in finance a few years ago to work with Black Seed full time.<br/>\"I was tired of angrily protesting and I wanted to make a difference,\" she explains.<br/>\"I feel super privileged to set up a fund in the heart of Brixton and give back to the community that essentially raised me.\"<br/>Up to now Black Seed has been hosting regular community events, from fireside panels with successful entrepreneurs to networking dinners. The trio plan to continue these in addition to making investments.<br/>\"We've worked with around 2,500 to 3,000 companies so far, providing them with anything from mentoring, to networking opportunities, to investment,\" Yvonne says.<br/>One of the companies that caught the eye of Black Seed is a mother and daughter duo who run an online fashion and wellness brand.<br/>Caliya and Rose Sterling from Ealing, west London, set up The Pro Box seven years ago and have been receiving support from the entrepreneurs.<br/>Rose says Black Seed has \"helped us expand our network and we've been able to meet up with other entrepreneurs to share ideas.<br/>\"They have validated who we are as founders and allowed us to build more conviction around our proposition.<br/>\"It's super challenging to get funding for your business in the UK and being connected to Black Seed has opened so many doors for us.\"<br/>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The convenience and breadth of an AI chatbot can't compete with the pleasures of chatting with someone whose personality quirks I've learned over the course of years. It is however a useful supplement.<br/>And I'm just one of many people who have discovered in recent months the benefits of AI-based chat for language learning.<br/>A Costa Rican who works in the construction industry tells me that his AI-powered keyboard has been useful for polishing up his technical vocabulary in English. For instance, it's saved him a great deal of time to be able to find an English word for a tool by describing it. <br/>A South African caf\u00e9 owner has gone further in improving his Spanish grammar with the aid of AI. He had a hard time finding simple study tools, especially given his ADHD, so he started using ChatGPT to quickly generate and adapt study aids like charts of verb tenses. <br/>Developers have been quick to jump on this wave of interest, and there are now numerous apps that have drawn on open-source code to customise AI for language learners. These can be more appropriate for learners than general chatbots like the virtual companion Replika. <br/>Blanka Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, an associate professor of applied linguistics at the University of Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 in Czechia, says that Replika has been useful for her students to practise informal English. <br/>But the conversations could become repetitive, language corrections were missing, and the chatbot would sometimes ask students for sexy pictures. \"This was quite abusive.\"<br/>In contrast, one of the specific language-learning chatbots is LangAI, launched in March by Federico Ruiz Cassarino. Mr Ruiz Cassarino drew on his own experiences of learning English after moving from Uruguay to the UK. His English skills improved dramatically from speaking every day, compared to more academic methods. He's now using his own app to work on his Italian.<br/>Many people get self-conscious about making mistakes in a language they barely speak, even to a tutor, Mr Ruiz Cassarino notes. But a chatbot won't judge you. And the new wave of generative AI is so advanced that it can cultivate AI penpals, which is how he sees his product.<br/>Rather than sticking to boring pre-scripted roleplays, with current AI \"you can speak about things that are interesting to you, which makes it feel like not as much of a chore to learn\".<br/>While many language learners are using popular chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard to practice, Mr Ruiz Cassarino believes that specific language-acquisition apps like his are useful.<br/>\"We worked really hard to make this well tailored for somebody who wants to learn languages,\" he says. The team customised LangAI's user interface to match users' vocabulary levels, added the ability to make corrections during a conversation, and enabled the conversion of speech to text.<br/>According to Mr Ruiz Cassarino, they're seeing some impressive retention numbers for an education app. Of users who try the app for around 10 minutes, roughly 45% will still be using it a month later. They're now focused on building the subscriber base of people willing to pay for unlimited use. <br/>Related to that, they're planning advancements like tracking of improved skills and the ability to personalise the chatbot's tone and personality (perhaps even to practise a language while conversing with historical figures).<br/>Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1, who is also a member of the research project Language in the Human-Machine Era, has assessed the useability and usefulness of AI chatbots for students of foreign languages. This research suggests that AI chatbots are helpful for vocabulary development, grammar and other language skills, especially when they offer corrective feedback.<br/>To stay ahead of the trend, well-established language-learning apps have been integrating AI into their own platforms. Duolingo began collaborating with OpenAI in September 2022, using that company's GPT-4.<br/>It seems unlikely that AI chatbots will replace Duolingo altogether. Joy Ehonwa, an editor and writer in Lagos, mainly uses Duolingo to learn French.<br/>But lately she's also been using an AI chatbot developed in Nigeria to help with her French.<br/>She interacts with this chatbot, Kainene vos Savant, the way she would with \"an all-knowing human friend\". <br/>Ms Ehonwa explains, \"My questions revolve around 'why'? When I fail an exercise on Duolingo, the app is not great at helping me understand why the thing that was wrong, was wrong. So, I ask Kainene. Also, when I think a sentence should be a certain way and it isn't, I ask Kainene why and she helps me understand why it cannot be the way I expect it to be, as an English speaker.\"<br/>If the older language-learning platforms have weaknesses, so does AI-powered language learning. Users are reporting that chatbots are well versed in widely spoken European languages, but quality degrades for languages that are underrepresented online or that have different writing systems. Many of the AI language-learning apps are available for a limited set of languages.<br/>Even in common languages, the chatbots make errors - sometimes even inventing words. One problem is that they deliver text so confidently, it would be easy for a relatively new learner to take what they say as correct.<br/>Emily M Bender, a professor of computational linguistics at the University of Washington in the US, has concerns, \"What kind of biases and inappropriate ways of talking about other people might they be learning from the chatbot?\" Other ethical issues, such as data privacy, may also be neglected.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Still, Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 believes that there will be an enormous market for such technologies. And like a number of language learners, she points out that GPT-4, available with a paid subscription to ChatGPT, has made astonishing strides on accuracy.<br/>Though many teachers disagree, she believes, \"It's just a matter of time when artificial intelligence will replace us as teachers of foreign languages.\"<br/>While that may sound extreme, \"teachers will still have an important role as mentors and facilitators, particularly with beginner learners and older people since teachers have a strong understanding of the individual learning styles, language needs, and goals of each student.\"<br/>It will be key for language teachers to assess the added value of AI and their role in relation to it, as more sophisticated self-directed learning becomes possible. As Assoc Prof Kl\u00edmov\u00e1 advises, \"Technology is here to stay, and we have to face it and reconsider our teaching methods and assessments.\" <br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The service, which offers shipping perks, access to streaming movies and more, costs $139 a year or $14.99 monthly in the US and \u00a395 per year in the UK. <br/>The FTC said Amazon used website designs that pushed customers into agreeing to enrol in Prime and have the subscription automatically renew as they were making purchases. <br/>The company attempted to make it difficult for users to opt out of auto-enrolment because \"those changes would also negatively affect Amazon's bottom line\", the agency alleged in the complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle. <br/>It also said Amazon put customers seeking to cancel through a cumbersome \"four-page, six-click, fifteen option\" process, which the FTC said was known internally as \"Iliad\" in a nod to the Greek epic about the \"long, arduous Trojan War\". <br/>Though Amazon altered the cancellation process shortly before the lawsuit was filed, the FTC said the company's tactics broke laws aimed at protecting shoppers.<br/>\"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,\" FTC Chair Lina Khan said.<br/>The FTC is seeking a court order to force Amazon to change its practices, as well as financial penalties in an unspecified amount.<br/>Amazon said it had been in the middle of discussing the issues with the agency when the lawsuit was filed without notice. <br/>\"The truth is that customers love Prime, and by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership,\" the company said. <br/>The FTC has repeatedly warned online firms against using \"dark patterns\" to manipulate shoppers.<br/>It had been investigating Amazon's Prime programme since 2021.<br/>It said the company had attempted to delay the probe on multiple occasions, including by refusing to deliver documents in a timely manner. <br/>Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, a senior analyst at Insider Intelligence analyst said the FTC was \"making an example of Amazon\".<br/>\"It's quite common for companies to make it more difficult to cancel an account than it is to create one,\" she said.<br/>Ms Khan, who was appointed to her post by President Joe Biden, made her name critiquing US competition policy related to Amazon.<br/>She has promised to move more aggressively to police online shopping and the power of America's tech giants. <br/>The lawsuit marks the third action from the FTC involving Amazon in recent weeks.<br/>The company agreed to pay $25m last month to settle charges it had violated child privacy laws by keeping recordings children made on Alexa. <br/>It agreed to pay another $5.8m to resolve claims that Ring, the doorbell company Amazon purchased in 2018, had violated privacy protections by giving staff unrestricted access to customer videos and failing to implement precautions against hackers. <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

A huge margin of users voted for r/pics to \"only allow images of John Oliver looking sexy\", with 37,331 votes for and -2,239 votes against. Other subreddits saw similar results.<br/>And it isn't just John Oliver that Reddit has to contend with.<br/>Other subreddits are similarly remaining active while changing their communities to fit within Reddit's rules, with r/iPhone now dedicated to \"dashing images\" of Apple chief executive Tim Cook, and moderators of r/scams approving content deliberately slowly, taking up to 14 days to review a post rather than a few minutes.<br/>Reddit communities go dark in protest at changes<br/>Twitch scraps ad changes after streamers leave<br/>Social media platform Reddit files to go public<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Last year, it resisted calls to cut ties with its controversial star Joe Rogan, who reportedly received $200m in 2020 for giving the streamer exclusive listening rights.<br/>But Mr Rogan's show offers several multi-hour episodes each week, which reportedly command an average audience of 11 million people. <br/>Meghan by contrast delivered just 12 episodes of her Archetypes podcast last year.<br/>The joint statement announcing the split said the Sussexes and Spotify were \"proud\" of the material they made together. <br/>And a string of accolades showed why.<br/>Archetypes' debut last year hit the top of Spotify's charts in six markets, including the US and UK. The show, in which Meghan interviewed fellow celebrities such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling, also won a People's Choice Award.<br/>But crisis communications guru Mark Borkowski says the show may not have been compelling enough when Spotify reviewed the numbers.  <br/>\"It's always about the content.... clearly there hasn't been a big enough audience for it,\" he says. \"If you can't deliver your fee, no one's going to pay it.\"<br/>Mr Borkowski says there is little doubt that the duke and duchess still have value as a media brand. But it may not be what it once was. <br/>Polling for Newsweek earlier this year suggested the couple's popularity in the US suffered following the publicity blitz surrounding their Netflix documentary series and the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare. \"The more Prince Harry and Meghan say, the less Americans like them,\" was Newsweek's headline.<br/>Mr Borkowski says the pair, who stepped back as working royals in 2020, will have to \"think hard\" about what they can offer in whatever they do next.<br/>\"It's a thread that's been pulled out of the brand,\" he says of the Spotify break-up. \"If they want to stop it unravelling they've really got to think hard. The biggest question is are they going to learn from this setback or are they going to ignore it as just a blip.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the Hollywood talent agency now representing the duchess told the Wall Street Journal this week: \"Meghan is continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform.\"<br/>Max Willens, senior analyst at Insider Intelligence, says Spotify is not the only tech giant that spent heavily in recent years to sign talent who failed to live up to the promise implied by the money they commanded. <br/>Those heady days ended last year, as economic sentiment soured and share prices sank. <br/>But shares in Spotify, which continues to add users and has seen its catalogue of podcasts jump to more than five million, are up nearly 90% this year, as investors welcome Mr Ek's promises to stay focused on \"efficiency\". <br/>In announcing the \"next phase\" for its podcasting business this month, the company signalled it would embrace lower-cost, third party creators, while pushing investment towards \"always on\" programming. <br/>\"The platforms that have gotten into [podcasting] had to take some time to figure out what constituted a good investment,\" Mr Willens says. He calls the decision by Spotify and the duke and duchess to part ways an \"understandable and natural part of that that process\". <br/>\"Those were big, big deals designed to generate buzz and grab headlines and they accomplished that. Whether they made good long-term economic sense is a different question.\"<br/>Spotify podcast deal with Harry and Meghan ends<br/>Where do Harry and Meghan get their money?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It is a well-trodden and often profitable process.<br/>\"Once Clop names companies to its data leak site, the group will start its rounds of negotiations with affected organisations, demanding ransom payments in order to avoid their data being breached, said Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at ReliaQuest.<br/>Mr Morgan says the hackers will hope that the victims make contact and set a deadline of how long they have before their data is made public. <br/>Clop has been known to demand ransoms of hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars but police forces around the world discourage victims from paying as it fuels these criminal gangs.<br/>The MOVEit hack was first disclosed on 31 May when US company Progress Software said hackers had found a way to break into its MOVEit Transfer tool. <br/> MOVEit is software designed to move sensitive files securely and is popular around the world with most of its customers in the US.<br/>Progress Software said it alerted its customers as soon as the hack was discovered and quickly released a downloadable security update.<br/>But the criminals were already able to use their access to get into the databases of potentially hundreds of other companies.<br/>Payroll services provider Zellis, which is based in the UK, was a MOVEit user which was subsequently breached.

Now it is one of the world's most powerful technology companies, with an annual revenue of $200bn (\u00a3158.2bn). <br/>It is best known for making more than half of Apple's products - from iPhones to iMacs - but it also counts Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Amazon among its clients.<br/>For decades, it has thrived on a playbook perfected by multinational corporations - they design products in the US, manufacture them in China and then sell them to the world. That is how it grew from a small component-making business to the consumer electronics giant it is today.<br/>But as global supply chains adjust to souring ties between Washington and Beijing, Foxconn finds itself in an unenviable spot - caught between the world's two biggest economies, the very nations that have powered its growth until now. <br/>The US and China are at loggerheads over many things, from trade to the war in Ukraine. But one of the biggest potential flashpoints is Taiwan, where Foxconn is headquartered.<br/>Taiwan has been a thorny issue for a long time but Chinese leader Xi Jinping's repeated pledges of \"reunification\" have upset the uneasy status quo. Meanwhile, the US, under President Joe Biden, has been more vocal in its support for Taiwan in case of an attack.<br/>Some US voices have crossed China's red line, calling for independence, although the White House has reaffirmed its position that it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei.<br/>There are hopes of a thaw with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting China this weekend. But there are also fears of a conflict - one US general has estimated it could happen as soon as the next few years.<br/>\"The United States and China are engaged in what we see as strategic competition,\" said Shihoko Goto, the deputy director for the Asia programme at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.<br/>\"Foxconn wants to do business with both, but there can only be one winner.\"<br/>But Mr Liu does not think it is that simple. For one, he said, Foxconn's business model, which relies on US designs and Chinese manufacturing, is far from over.<br/>\"We hire a lot of workers and most countries, including China, want to support their workers,\" Mr Liu said, adding that the Chinese government wants companies like Foxconn to keep going because of the huge number of jobs they create.<br/>Are rising tensions putting pressure on the model? \"So far? We haven't seen it,\" he told us.<br/>But the West and its allies have called for countries and companies to \"de-risk\" from China - a long-term shift to curb global reliance on China that is yet to play out.<br/>When asked if that was impacting business, Mr Liu responded cautiously. <br/>Some overseas clients had pushed to move production out of China, he said, but this was their decision to make, not Foxconn's.<br/>\"They get the push from their government about de-risking, and then they will let us know.\"<br/>Geopolitics aside, Covid-19 is another reason companies might consider \"de-risking\" from China.<br/>A mix of harsh Covid policies, a lack of space for quarantine and the infectiousness of the Omicron variant led to protests and riots at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou - the world's biggest iPhone plant - in late 2022. Hundreds of workers, who feared the spread of the virus, fled the campus on foot.<br/>Mr Liu said the scenes that played out for the world to see were caused by a lack of transportation due to Beijing's unyielding zero-Covid policy.<br/>But when pressed further, he admitted that he should have handled things differently.<br/>\"If the same situation occurs again, I would stop production altogether,\" he said, reiterating that he would have made that decision even at the risk of irking clients like Apple.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory<br/>The company's success certainly rests on its impressive client base, but Foxconn is just as indispensable to those clients.<br/>To understand how essential it is to Apple, for instance, you just need to look at how much of the iPhone is made by Foxconn - around 60%, by some estimates. The factories in China make some of the most essential parts of the device - camera modules, connectors, even the back of the phone casing.<br/>That expertise is also what Mr Liu is hoping will fuel Foxconn's next big bet: electric cars.<br/>\"Look at this - this is a big iPhone, so we're very familiar with this,\" he said, pointing to a panel that controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in.<br/>Built for families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the shiny white SUV is one of several models manufactured by Foxconn. <br/>\"The reason why we think this is a great opportunity for us is that with the traditional gas engine, you have engines which are mostly mechanical. But with EVs, it's batteries and motors,\" he explains. <br/>That is a familiar language for a technology company like Foxconn, he added. <br/>Foxconn's hopes to capture about 5% of the global electric vehicle market in the next few years - an ambitious target given the firm has only made a handful of models so far. But it is a gamble that Mr Liu is confident will pay off.<br/>\"It doesn't make sense for you to make [EVs] in one place, so regionalised production for cars is very natural,\" he added. Foxconn car factories will be based in Ohio in the US, in Thailand, Indonesia and perhaps even in India, he said. <br/>For now, the company will keep focusing on what it does best - making electronic products for clients. But perhaps not too far in the future, Foxconn will do the same for clients with electric cars.<br/>Either way, with the foray into electric cars, Foxconn is diversifying not just production but also supply lines - both of which, Mr Liu believes, hold the key to the company's future.<br/>iPhone maker hikes pay ahead of new model launch<br/>iPhone maker sees revenue slump as demand weakens<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

CGI said  it was more than 90% accurate during a test run.<br/>It's being trialled in what's known as the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a 55-sq-mile (142-sq-km) protected area that includes important natural habitats as well as farmland and small towns. <br/>\"We'll give (the AI) the history,\" said CGI's chief sustainability officer Mattie Yeta. \"We'll give it all of the geographic information, as well as data sets from the sensors for it to learn and develop the predictive mechanisms to be able to inform where these incidents are occurring and indeed when they will take place.\"<br/>It's hoped the project could clean up the seaside resort town of Combe Martin, where the quality of bathing water has long been a concern. <br/>\"It's always been bumping along the bottom in terms of water quality,\" says Andy Bell from the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.<br/>Though the water at Combe Martin was last year rated by the Environment Agency as 'good', Mr Bell says that was mainly down to dry weather.  More typical years, he says, were 2018 and 2019 when it received a 'poor' rating, which meant a notice being posted advising people not to swim. <br/>\"There is very much a fear in the community of what would happen if the bathing water status was rescinded.\" Andy says <br/>\"It would impact on the cafes, the restaurants, the B&B's\u2026 people want to come to a clean place to enjoy themselves.\"<br/>The River Umber is the main culprit, according to Mr Bell. It reaches the sea through a corridor of lush green algae on the edge of the beach. The Umber is usually little more than a stream but it receives discharges both from a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff from farms. <br/>Cleaning up the Umber is seen as a first step towards improving the water quality on the beach and the key to that, according to the artificial intelligence project, is a huge amount of real-time information.  <br/>A couple of kilometres upstream from Combe Martin beach, a floating water sensor is being installed in the river. It's a square black box with solar panels on top and is moored by a cable to the bank. <br/>It automatically transmits a stream of data on six key indicators of water health including acidity (pH), ammonia, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and how clear the water is (turbidity).<br/>\"It's a really good overview of water quality,\" said Glyn Cotton, the chief executive of environment-focussed technology company Watr, which is supplying the \u00a32,000-a-go ($2,557) sensors to the project. <br/>\"If sewage was being discharged upstream we would see spikes in things like ammonia and pH and we can then cross-reference that with temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.\"<br/>About 50 connected sensors are being used across the catchment area, a mix of water, soil and rain gauges. Mapping company Ordnance Survey are providing the expertise to integrate that information with location specific data and satellite imagery. <br/>\"We can start training the model using data to get it understanding that when there was a pollution event - whether it was associated with a particular area?\" said Donna Lyndsay from Ordnance Survey. \"Was there for example a particular rainfall event that washed it all off?\"<br/>The hope is that the AI might, for example, advise a farmer to stop putting more fertiliser on his field, if the soil is dry and heavy rain forecast because of the likelihood of it being washed into the waterways. <br/>Preventing raw sewage being discharged by water treatment plants - a practice allowed when heavy rainfall overwhelms facilities -  is more complicated. The AI might see it coming after heavy rainfall but that doesn't mean the water company has the capacity to stopped it being released. <br/>The first phase of the AI project was a desk-based model using historic data, with CGI saying it predicted pollution events with 91.5% accuracy. Now the AI model is being unleashed 'in the wild' and the question is whether it can do the same.<br/>\"We're starting very small here (in North Devon) \u2026 but the idea is very much to scale up and roll this out to different parts of the UK.\" said CGI's Mattie Yeta. <br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing fast, and transforming many aspects of life.

No, this is a projection of human nature on machines\" he said. It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research \"under lock and key\", he added.<br/>People who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.<br/>\"It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.\"<br/>\"Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,\" and the same would happen with AI he said.<br/>Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.<br/>Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.<br/>He said there was \"no question\" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.<br/>When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.<br/>There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists \"get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes\", he said. \"That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.\"<br/>In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued \"it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch\". He added: \"And if you realise it's not safe you just don't built it\".<br/>It has been argued that AI has the potential to replace many jobs, and some companies have paused recruiting for certain roles as a result. <br/>Prof LeCun told the BBC: \"This is not going to put a lot of people out of work permanently\". But work would change because we have \"no idea\" what the most prominent jobs will be 20 years from now, he said.<br/>Intelligent computers would create \"a new renaissance for humanity\" the way the internet or the printing-press did, he said.<br/>Prof LeCun was speaking Tuesday ahead of a vote on Europe's AI Act which is designed to regulate artificial intelligence.<br/>He said from his conversations with AI start-ups in Europe \"they don't like it at all, they think it's too broad, maybe too restrictive\". But he said he wasn't an expert on the legislation, <br/>Prof LeCun said he was not against regulation - but in his view each application would need its own rules, for example different rules would govern AI systems in cars and those scanning medical images.<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>AI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's work<br/>AI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

This is where the focus of strict controls on the tech will be.<br/>But as AI continues to develop quickly, Ms Vestager said there was a need to be pragmatic when it comes to fine-tuning rules around this technology. <br/>\"It's better to get, let's say 80% now than 100% never, so let's get started and then return when we learn and then correct with others,\" she said.<br/>Ms Vestager said there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence the next elections. <br/>She said the challenge for police and intelligence services would be to be \"fully on top\" of a criminal sector where there is a risk they get ahead in the race to utilise the tech. <br/>\"If your social feed can be scanned to get a thorough profile of you, the risk of being manipulated is just enormous,\" she said, \"and if we end up in a situation where we believe nothing, then we have undermined our society completely.\"<br/>Many tech leaders and researchers signed a letter in March calling for a pause in the development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4. <br/>But Ms Vestager said this was not realistic.<br/>\"No-one can enforce it.

The UK has blocked buyout while the European Union approved it. In order for the deal to go through, Microsoft and Activision need approval from regulators in the UK, the EU and the US.<br/>The FTC has argued that the deal would give Microsoft's Xbox console exclusive access to Activision games, leaving competitors Nintendo and Sony out in the cold.<br/>Microsoft and Activision now have until 16 June to submit legal arguments to oppose the preliminary injunction and the FTC will have to reply on 20 June.<br/>Microsoft has said a takeover of Activision would benefit gaming companies and players.<br/>It has offered to sign a legally binding agreement with the FTC to provide Call of Duty games to rivals including Sony for a decade.<br/>The European Commission has approved the acquisition, saying that Microsoft's offer of 10-year free licensing deals - which promise European consumers and cloud game streaming services access to Activision's PC and console games - mean there would be fair competition in the market.<br/>But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) blocked the deal in April, saying it was concerned the takeover would offer reduced innovation and less choice for gamers.<br/>Microsoft and Activision hit out at the CMA's decision and said they would appeal.<br/>Microsoft president Brad Smith said it marked the company's \"darkest day\" in its four decades of working in Britain.<br/>In response to the announcement by the FTC on Monday, Mr Smith said Microsoft welcomed the \"opportunity to present our case in federal court\" in its attempt to persuade US regulators to allow the deal to be completed.<br/>\"We believe accelerating the legal process in the US will ultimately bring more choice and competition to the market,\" he added.<br/>The purchase of Activision, which also makes Candy Crush, is seen to be important for Microsoft, which is trying to catch up with its main competitor Sony. <br/>However, this attempted investment from Microsoft could be seen as a play for the future of video games, with the firm betting big on its Xbox Game Pass service, which has been described as the \"Netflix of games\".<br/>Microsoft believes the future lies in players having subscriptions to libraries and streaming games through \"cloud gaming\", rather than making one-off purchases - which is the main way of accessing games at the moment.<br/>US moves to block Microsoft's Activision takeover<br/>Microsoft's big deal - what you need to know<br/>Microsoft's $69bn Activision deal approved by EU<br/>Microsoft's Activision takeover blocked in UK<br/>Xbox showcase: Is Microsoft back in the game?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It lets Spotify, YouTube and BBC iPlayer suggest what you might want to play next, and helps Facebook and Twitter decide which social media posts to show users.<br/>AI lets Amazon analyse customers' buying habits to recommend future purchases - and the firm is also using the technology to crack down on fake reviews. <br/>Two powerful AI-driven applications or apps which have become very high profile in recent months are ChatGPT and Snapchat My AI. <br/>They are examples of what is called \"generative\" AI. <br/>This uses the patterns and structures it identifies in vast quantities of source data to generate new and original content which feels like it has been created by a human. <br/>The AI is coupled with a computer programme known as a chatbot, which \"talks\" to human users via text. <br/>The apps can answer questions, tell stories and write computer code. <br/>But both programmes sometimes generate incorrect answers for users, and can reproduce the bias contained in their source material, such as sexism or racism.<br/>With few rules currently in place governing how AI is used, experts have warned that its rapid growth could be dangerous. Some have even said AI research should be halted. <br/>In May, Geoffrey Hinton, widely considered to be one of the godfathers of artificial intelligence, quit his job at Google, warning that AI chatbots could soon be more intelligent than humans.<br/>Later that month, the US-based Center for AI Safety published a statement supported by dozens of leading tech specialists. <br/>They argue AI could be used to generate misinformation that could destabilise society. In the worst-case scenario, they say machines might become so intelligent that they take over, leading to the extinction of humanity.<br/>However, the EU's tech chief Margrethe Vestager told the BBC that AI's potential to amplify bias or discrimination was a more pressing concern. <br/>In particular she is concerned about the role AI could play in making decisions that affect people's livelihoods such as loan applications, adding there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence elections.<br/>Others, including tech pioneer Martha Lane Fox, say we shouldn't get what she calls \"too hysterical\" about AI, urging a more sensible conversation about its capabilities.<br/>Governments around the world are wrestling with how to regulate AI. <br/>Members of the European Parliament have just voted in favour of the EU's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act, which will put in place a strict legal framework for AI, which companies would need to follow. <br/>Margrethe Vestager says \"guardrails\" are needed to counter the biggest risks posed by AI. <br/>The legislation - which is expected to come into effect in 2025 - categorises applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>Higher-risk systems like those used to evaluate credit scores or decide access to housing would face the strictest controls. <br/>These rules will not apply in the UK, where the government set out its vision for the future of AI in March. <br/>It ruled out setting up a dedicated AI regulator, and said instead that existing bodies would be responsible for its oversight.<br/>But Ms Vestager says that AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\", and wants to build a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries. <br/>US lawmakers have also expressed concern about whether the existing voluntary codes are up to the job.  <br/>Meanwhile, China intends to make companies notify users whenever an AI algorithm is being used.<br/>AI has the potential to revolutionise the world of work, but this raises questions about which roles it might displace. <br/>A recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe, as certain tasks and job functions become automated. That equates to a quarter of all the work humans currently do in the US and Europe. <br/>The report highlighted a number of industries and roles that could be affected, including administrative jobs, legal work, architecture, and management.<br/>But it also identified huge potential benefits for many sectors, and predicted that AI could lead to a 7% increase in global GDP. <br/>Some areas of medicine and science are already taking advantage of AI, with doctors using the technology to help spot breast cancers, and scientists using it to develop new antibiotics. <br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,\" she says.<br/>Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal.<br/>However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies.<br/>\"We are at a real inflection point,\" she says. \"The showdown is here.\"<br/>Treat cryptocurrency as gambling, MPs say<br/>US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens<br/>NatWest limits crypto transfers over scam fears<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government. The government says the rules are meant to tackle misinformation and hate speech, but experts worry it would lead to censorship.<br/>Mr Musk, who succeeded Mr Dorsey, said in April that \"rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict\".<br/>In Monday's interview, Mr Dorsey compared India's actions to those by governments in Turkey and Nigeria, which have briefly restricted the platform in the past.<br/>\"Turkey is very similar [to India], we had so many requests from Turkey. We fought Turkey in their courts and often won, but they threatened to shut us down constantly,\" he said. <br/>\"Nigeria is another example... The situation was such that we could not even put our employees on the ground in the country out of fear of what the government might do to them.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\".<br/>Home Office drops 'racist' visa decision algorithm<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe? Here are five of the challenges ahead.<br/>The European Parliament has taken two years to come up with a definition of an AI system - software that can \"for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments they interact with\". <br/>This week, it is voting on its Artificial Intelligence Act - the first legal rules of their kind on AI, which go beyond voluntary codes and require companies to comply.  <br/>Former UK Office for Artificial Intelligence head Sana Kharaghani points out the technology has no respect for borders. <br/>\"We do need to have international collaboration on this - I know it will be hard,\" she tells BBC News. \"This is not a domestic matter. These technologies don't sit within the boundaries of one country <br/>But there remains no plan for a global, United-Nations-style AI regulator - although, some have suggested it - and different territories have different ideas:<br/>\"If people trust it, then they'll use it,\" International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation EU government and regulatory affairs head Jean-Marc Leclerc says.<br/>There are enormous opportunities for AI to improve people's lives in incredible ways. It is already:<br/>But what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?<br/>The European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product. <br/>Companies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover. <br/>But can developers predict or control how their product might be used?<br/>So far, AI has been largely self-policed.<br/>The big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>But will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?<br/>You can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.<br/>And Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations. <br/>\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.<br/>Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\". <br/>It can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".<br/>Chatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.<br/>And in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.<br/>But others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.  <br/>ChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.<br/>Now, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams. <br/>The capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.<br/>And two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm. <br/>The Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 -  \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says. <br/>She is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks.<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>Powerful AI ban possible, government adviser warns<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Shells struck the house, she says.<br/>There's emotion in her voice as she explains what the building used to be like. <br/>An old photo she sends via WhatsApp shows a large property with balconies and a pond in the front garden. Images taken after the attack capture the soot-stained, crumbling walls left by the assault.<br/>But Mrs Pylypenko and her family now have a new home in the garden of their old one - a factory-made house that was assembled in just a few days last autumn.<br/>The building, a donation to the family, was one of the first homes of its kind built by Ukrainian firm HOMErs, which says its designs could benefit millions of refugees and people still in Ukraine who have lost their properties in the conflict. <br/>HOMErs, previously known as Tera Monada, has a range of modular houses, made from standardised factory-made units that slot together quickly to achieve the desired final design. <br/>Given the extent of damage in Ukraine, any reconstruction efforts will have to be both fast and cost-effective. In March, the World Bank estimated that it could take $411bn (\u00a3323bn) to rebuild the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has, in the past, put the figure at $1tn.<br/>\"There are about 200 destroyed houses in my community,\" says Mrs Pylypenko. \"Modular houses are absolutely important for us.\"<br/>Her new property is significantly smaller than her old one, she notes. But it is the only such building in her village and accommodates six, including Mrs Pylypenko's 10-month old granddaughter. Her daughter, who was pregnant at the time of the Russian attack on the village last year, was brought to Poland by volunteers where she gave birth.<br/>Lots of Ukrainians, sadly, know this predicament, says HOMErs co-founder Alex Stepura.<br/>\"In our own company, so many of our people lost their accommodations, their houses, their apartments,\" he says, pointing out how makeshift shipping container homes have become a common sight in the country during the past year or so.<br/>In order to provide a more appropriate solution, Mr Stepura and his colleagues have developed modular homes that are comprised of multiple three-by-three metre units. An entire house as well as furniture and white goods can be flat-packed and loaded on a single lorry, he says.<br/>To date, the company has supplied around 50 homes to families in Ukraine, a spokesman for HOMErs says. In a video shared by the firm, factory workers slot a wall section into a foundation piece and rotate a lever downwards, locking the two tightly together, demonstrating the ease of construction.<br/>HOMErs' Kyiv factory is currently producing around 10 homes per month, according to Mr Stepura's business partner Chris Baxter, a British investor. But the pair are hoping to raise roughly \u20ac5m (\u00a34.2m) to build a new factory in Slovakia, which would boost production to a couple of hundred homes per month, or so.<br/>Mr Stepura has decades of experience in engineering and robotics. His companies produce vending machines and drones, for example. Some of those drones are currently deployed on reconnaissance missions for the Ukrainian military, he adds.<br/>The modular homes should be high-tech but also intuitive and easy to use - the architectural equivalent of a new smartphone, he suggests.<br/>It must be said that there's nothing new about this idea. Modular homes been around for decades and many companies, including Ikea, have invested in the concept. Mr Baxter argues that the HOMErs modules will attain a good balance of quality and affordability. <br/>One grid-connected, fully furnished, three-module home costs $18,000 (\u00a314,000), with additional modules priced at $6,000. The designs might offer a good solution for Ukrainian refugees currently living abroad who hope one day to return home, suggests Mr Baxter.<br/>\"Those houses can be packed up and moved together with the people to repopulate the country as quickly as possible without having to wait for all of this construction to take place,\" he says.<br/>Such a thing is possible in theory, though \"little tested\" says Gemma Burgess at the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research.<br/>That said, rebuilding towns and cities with modular properties could be a smart way to go, she adds.<br/>\"In Ukraine, if you're trying to build large volumes of housing, it might be a much cheaper, more efficient way to do it.\"<br/>There are other ventures in Ukraine using the latest technology to help communities rebuild after shelling or missile strikes. Take the 3D-printed school in Lviv, which is currently undergoing a second phase of construction. Or the prefabricated concrete building panels developed by Ukrainian firm Well-being ConTech.<br/>All such efforts ought to avoid repeating the rush to build properties - often of low standard - that followed the Second World War in countries including the UK, adds Dr Burgess: \"Quality and sustainability is going to be key.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Mr Stepura emphasises his commitment to high quality design and accurate manufacturing. Mr Baxter is taking delivery of one of the modular homes himself, where he will live while his UK house is renovated in the coming months.

And although the house is small - there are bunk beds for the adults, as well as a cot for the baby - it is a big step up from living in the damaged basement of her former house, a situation she had endured for months.<br/>\"We didn't know how to live,\" she says.

But Mr Namasivayasivam recently divulged his blunder to dozens of people at an event in Toronto, Canada.<br/>His mistake seven years ago involved his work trying to ensure that when bands and solo artists submitted 10-second long, looping videos to accompany their songs, they would play smoothly on people's mobile phones.<br/>At the time the videos were being trialled in Canada.<br/>They should have been streamed to users' handsets just the one time, but due to Mr Namasivayasivam's error they were constantly re-downloaded onto people's phones every 10 seconds.  <br/>For those not connected to wi-fi, it quickly used up all their data.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam only became aware of the mistake when he read complaints on an online forum. One person had written that it had \"killed his data\".<br/>Another said: \"I hate this feature so much. Whoever came up with this, should be fired and shot.\"<br/>While most of us might have wanted to keep such memories locked away, Mr Namasivayasivam revealed all into a microphone while standing on a stage in front of room full of strangers.<br/>The gathering was part of a global movement, with more than 250 cities now participating in public showcases of how entrepreneurs and other business leaders, mainly in the tech space, fail and then recover from their gaffes.<br/>The idea is that it is cathartic to talk about such things, and everyone in attendance can learn from the mistakes, and ask questions.<br/>Mr Namasivayasivam told the crowd in Toronto: \"It was at this moment that I messed up, and this is where the feelings of imposter syndrome and anxiety and shame came flooding in.\"<br/>He was one of three speakers at the event. Afterwards he told the BBC that it felt good to share his face-palm moment, \"and how someone can bounce back from that embarrassment\".<br/>Today Mr Namasivayasivam is the founder and chief executive of Skillify, a Toronto-based provider of software coding training.<br/>Bill Murray (not the famous actor), works for Canadian software firm Padiem, which makes systems that enable firms to handle timesheets and wages.<br/>He was in the audience watching Mr Namasivayasivam, and says that the story particularly resonated with him. <br/>\"If you've never made any mistakes as a coder, you probably weren't innovating enough,\" says Mr Murray.<br/>\"Most people want to hide their embarrassing moments or failures, but because the speakers open the floor with some of their toughest moments, it sets the stage for everyone attending to let their guard down and really get to know one another.\"<br/>Tech entrepreneurs shouldn't only celebrate their wins, Mr Murray adds. \"When you study someone's success, it's almost like asking them what lottery numbers they played to win.<br/>\"Of course you can learn lots from successful people, but to me the concept of openly talking about your failures felt like there was much more to learn from.\"<br/>Marsha Druker, who organises the regular failure talks in Toronto, says she looks for speakers willing to not just be open about their professional failure story.<br/>Instead she also wants them \"to tell audiences about what they learned about that mistake, now that they have had time to reflect on it\".<br/>She says a common theme to what tech entrepreneurs face when they fail is \"a story of resilience and coming out at the other side, and recognising that failure shouldn't be a taboo topic we don't talk about openly\".<br/>Venturing into that often off-limits topic is the reason why such celebrations of failure began in Mexico City in 2012, says Carlos Zimbr\u00f3n, a Mexican tech entrepreneur who first came up with the idea for the evenings.<br/>During a barbeque at home with other friends, Mr Zimbr\u00f3n says he expressed how boring it was to attend \"typical conference with keynote speakers talking about their successes, and how it was rare to hear the B-side of that story\".<br/>Soon after, he and his friends held the first failure talk in the same backyard space.<br/>As word spread about the Mexico City event, other entrepreneurs in cities in 80 countries around the world have since started their own parallel nights. They hold monthly talks, coupled with a Q&A session after each speaker.<br/>Mr Zimbron says that the talks, many of which are later uploaded to YouTube, \"can be inspiring for people who may have gone through the same problems\".<br/>He adds: \"When you can connect to someone else's mistakes, and can see how vulnerable they are in sharing that story, that's where you can connect with other entrepreneurs.\"<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Leah Edwards, is both a director at US investment fund Lighter Capital, and a lecturer on leadership and innovation at University of California, Berkeley.<br/>She says she loves that these public talks about business failure are \"normalizing the fact that something is hard, and that it takes a number of at-bats [a baseball term for a batter's turn] in order to find the right combination of teams and market opportunity, and the right product or service\".<br/>Ms Edwards adds Silicon Valley has long had a high tolerance for start-ups not succeeding, and that it is good to see this spreading.<br/>\"There will always be entrepreneurs whose companies don't work out in the end, but they pick themselves back up and try again,\" she says. \"I'm excited to see this recognition of that kind of resilience spreading into other geographies and cultures.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It rattled me, there was a lot of swearing and finger pointing. But it was very well done. It was uncomfortable in a good way.\" <br/>The play, called Smile, was about the life of legendary Dundee United manager Jim McLean. <br/>Ms Doyle had been expecting a conventional performance of a play featuring the blunt-spoken manager when she arrived at the Dundee Repertory earlier this year. <br/>Before the curtain rose she accepted an invite to a section of the foyer where VR headsets were on offer to curious theatre-goers.<br/>The intense preview sequence came from Box Office VR, a firm founded by Kelman and Gemma Greig-Kicks of Box Office VR.<br/>Having spent careers in film-making and touring theatre, the husband and wife team, hope that VR can extend the reach of theatre to untapped audiences.<br/>Anyone who wants to use the service would have to buy their own headset, but Box Office VR is designed to work on cheap systems like Google Cardboard VR Glasses. <br/>To watch a show the customer has to insert their phone into the VR device.<br/>Once the phone is place, the users strap the box, effectively a pair of cardboard goggles, around their head and plug in their own headphones. <br/>The app then streams a recorded performance to the phone, which the VR headset amplifies, taking the viewer into a 180 degree view of the stage and auditorium. <br/>It is aimed at anyone who might not think of visiting the theatre, or who cannot physically reach a venue. <br/>So far that's a small audience. Around a 100 people have downloaded a show through Box Office VR.<br/>Ms Greig-Kicks admits that Box Office VR is \"a passion project\" for her and her husband.<br/>Yet she says the potential is real. \"It means they can host shows that wouldn't otherwise be able to tour due to size or cost.\" <br/>Box Office VR has filmed other productions, including one for London's Sadler's Wells dance theatre which has a Digital Stage label for its own online repertoire. <br/>Other established names such as the York Theatre Royal have also experimented with making shows available via VR headsets.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>While an interesting use case for virtual reality, it's not going to make much of a dent in the billions of dollars invested in VR by technology giants like Meta (the owner of Facebook) and more recently Apple, which launched its VR system in June.<br/>But for cash-strapped regional theatre any exposure or extra revenue is welcome. <br/>The technology is also an exciting way to introduce schoolchildren to theatre.<br/>Lisa Kilbride teaches drama at Monifieth High School in Dundee and has harnessed Box Office VR for her mission to spread a love of theatre. <br/>The school has a large rural catchment area, meaning some pupils have to travel in for nearly an hour by bus. So bolting on a trip to see a play in the evening creates problems for pupils with a far-flung home to return to. <br/>Her drama teaching covers much more than acting. Ms Kilbride's pupils are studying for Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) exams and picking up skills needed in theatre directing, lighting or sound. <br/>The VR headset sparked excitement in her 12 and 13 year old SQA students. No-one turned down the chance to pull on the simple goggles. <br/>She is sure they're a valuable addition to her teaching toolkit and uses them to lure reluctant theatre-goers into a whole new experience. <br/>\"It's easy to pause and rewind the action and all of the kids talked about the lighting, the sound, the set.\"<br/>Sharing the thrill of theatre means everything to Ms Kilbride. \"If one child says 'I want to go to the theatre' after using the headset then I'm happy.\"<br/>The action on stage unfolds in front of the viewer, but the VR goggles also let them look about the theatre. <br/>Ms Kilbride wanted her students to become familiar with a whole world surrounding the stage, one they had never visited.  <br/>When she asked her students why they were tilting their heads up and around they explained they were glancing at the theatre itself. They had never seen anything like the interior of the Dundee Rep before. <br/>Liam Sinclair, business manager at the Dundee Rep, knows about the impact an early encounter with theatre can have. He owes his career to \"a brilliant drama teacher at school\" who left him intrigued by the whole question of how theatre works. <br/>Mr Sinclair explains how Smile brought a new audience, who loved both football and the Dundee United team, to his venue. <br/>And Box Office VR made a huge impression on the late manager's living relatives. <br/>\"We did this film version of it with Box Office VR and created the sample sessions using VR goggles. Jim's family came to the press night of the show and got really involved, putting the googles on. When they watched the VR they teared up. It was really like Jim was present and in the room.\" <br/>He realised that in this case technology had triggered deeper emotions than a stage performance. \"VR is a very personal experience as opposed to theatre, which is communal.\" <br/>Ms Doyle confirms this take on her memorable night out. \"Once you're sworn at by Jim McLean you stay sworn at!\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

He also had a short period as chief executive of US giant Hewlett-Packard.<br/>He believes Europe has got a lot to offer.<br/>Partially retired, the 69-year old divides his time between Paris and London and has spent the last decade advising small software companies.<br/>Today he has a new role, as one of a team of tech veterans determined to end Europe's underwhelming record of producing giant technology firms.<br/>Mr Apotheker is part of Boardwave, the brainchild of Phill Robinson. Mr Robinson is a British former software boss who has lived in Silicon Valley and retired after a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease. <br/>Boardwave grew out of Mr Robinson ruminating on what he could do to lift Europe's tech scene to Californian levels.<br/>Mr Apotheker joined Boardwave the day after its website went live. As Mr Robinson puts it, \"we're grateful for the careers we've had and the opportunity to share what we know.\" <br/>Both are driven by a pressing sense of passing time and a desire to spare future generations of tech pioneers the pains they endured.<br/>Mr Apotheker points out that Europe does have some leaders. He highlights specialist fields such as industrial design programs and the UK's lead in financial software. London's financial technology (fintech) scene wins his approval. <br/>But why aren't there more?<br/>He rejects the traditional argument that finding money is much easier in the US. <br/>\"I don't think this is about raising capital, Europe is awash with venture capital companies.\" <br/>Investors will sink $50bn into European tech businesses in 2023, according to venture capital firm Atomico.  <br/>One problem for European tech entrepreneurs is a lack of peers. <br/>\"I lived in Silicon Valley and there's always a group of people around who can give you advice. When I ran SAP and needed advice I talked to the wall!, \" says Mr Apotheker.<br/>\"Boardwave is trying to mentor other company bosses to help them grow. Being in charge can be a very lonely job. You worry about something in the middle of the night and it keeps on chewing at you. The value of picking up the phone and talking to someone is huge.\"<br/>He sees Boardwave's team saving his youthful successors from those sleepless nights and guiding the big ideas to fruition. <br/>More technology of business:<br/>Mr Apotheker still wishes he could have had a sympathetic guide to share concerns with when he ran SAP. \"There were a lot of decisions I struggled with at SAP and I wish I could have talked with someone who'd been there before me, someone I could bounce ideas off.\"  <br/>Boardwave was also born out of a sense that time is not on the side of wise older guys. \"Of the few hairs I have left lots of them are grey. So I'm willing to spend the time I have left on this.\" <br/>That includes talking about decisions that did not work out.<br/>\"We talk about mistakes we've made. We've made a lot of mistakes, and got a few things right!\" <br/>European scepticism is often cited as a poor contrast to the overwhelming optimism of Silicon Valley.<br/>Yet Mr Apotheker values the ability to ask penetrating questions in an industry with its fair share of fraudulent ventures such as Theranos, the Silicon Valley start-up whose founder Elizabeth Holmes has just begun an eleven-year prison sentence for defrauding investors. <br/> \"I am of mixed German/French heritage and I can be cynical and sceptical but I turn that to an advantage.\" <br/>His colleague, 58-year old Mr Robinson, is candid about how Parkinson's Disease motivates him. \"I've accumulated a lot of knowledge of the software sector and I want to share it with others before my brain gets mushy.\"<br/>He took one of the first computer science degrees in the UK and  worked in Silicon Valley at the age of 23, beginning an impressive career in business software. <br/>\"I believe Europeans have a great talent pool but it's fragmented. We're 1,000 miles across while Silicon Valley is 40 miles long.\" He founded Boardwave on his kitchen table in 2022 and it now has 800 members, chief executives and founders across Europe. <br/>Start-ups registered with Boardwave can connect with these mentors. Boardwave aims to shepherd them towards the critical stage of \u00a3100m turnover when they can spread their wings on the international stage. <br/>Other established initiatives echo Boardwave's drive to expand Europe's top tier of tech. Finland hosts a huge annual gathering, Slush, where tech start-ups can meet potential investors. <br/>The boss of Finnish success story WithSecure, a cybersecurity business that confronts the global threat of malware, hacking and ransom demands, is Juhani Hintikka. <br/>He too does pro bono coaching for local start-ups and agrees with the concept behind Boardwave. \"People do ask for advice and I try to do my bit.\" <br/>But he admits innovators are curbed by Europe's fragmentation, with multiple business cultures as opposed to the vast home market US companies can tap into.<br/>Ever ambitious, Mr Apotheker cites planemaker Airbus as a great European guiding light. \"European airline makers came together to take on Boeing and Airbus is now the largest in the world.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It says the figure is likely to rise by 73% to 3.88 billion tonnes by 2050.<br/>Plastic is particularly problematic. From the start of large-scale production of the material in the 1950s until 2015, more than 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste was produced, research from the Universities of Georgia and California calculated.<br/>Someone who will not find those statistics surprising is Mikela Druckman. She has spent a lot of time looking at what we throw away, as the founder of Greyparrot, a UK start-up that has created an AI system designed to analyse waste processing and recycling facilities.<br/>\"In a single day you will have literally mountains of waste in one facility coming through, and what's very shocking and surprising is that it never stops,\" she says. There are no holidays for waste, it just keeps coming.\"<br/>Greyparrot places cameras above the conveyor belts of around 50 waste and recycling sites in Europe, utilising AI software to analyse what passes through in real-time.<br/>AI technology has come on in leaps and bounds over the past year, and its ability to process images is now very sophisticated. However, Ms Druckman says it was still hard to train a system to recognise rubbish.<br/>\"A product like a Coke bottle, once it goes into the bin, will be crumpled, crushed and dirty, and makes the problem much more complex from an AI standpoint.\"<br/>Greyparrot's systems now track 32 billion waste objects per year, and the firm has built up a huge digital map of waste. This information can be used by waste managers to become more operationally efficient, but it can also be shared more widely.<br/>\"It is allowing regulators to have a much better understanding of what's happening with the material, what materials are problematic, and it is also influencing packaging design,\" says Ms Druckman.<br/>\"We talk about climate change and waste management as separate things, but actually they are interlinked because most of the reasons why we are using resources is because we're not actually recovering them.<br/>\"If we had stricter rules that change the way we consume, and how we design packaging, that has a very big impact on the value chain and how we are using resource.\"<br/>She hopes that big brands and other producers will start using data generated by firms like GreyParrot, and ultimately design more reusable products.<br/>Troy Swope runs a company that is intent on making better packaging. Footprint has worked with supermarkets, and with Gillette to convert its plastic razor trays to ones made of plant-based fibre.<br/>In a blogpost on Footprint's website, Mr Swope claims that consumers are being misled by a \"myth of recycling\".<br/>He referenced a plastic salad container that was labelled \"ready to recycle\" and asked what that actually meant.<br/>\"It's less likely than ever that their discarded single-use plastic ends up anywhere but a landfill,\" wrote Mr Swope. \"The only way out of the plastics crisis is to stop depending on it in the first place.\"<br/>So-called greenwashing is a big problem, says Ms Druckman. \"We've seen a lot of claims about eco or green packaging, but sometimes they are not backed up with real fact, and can be very confusing for the consumer.\"<br/>To help retailers know that used plastic bottles are in fact being recycled, and in what numbers, UK-firm Polytag covers them with an ultraviolet (UV) tag that is not visible to the human eye.<br/>When the bottles then arrive at the determined recycling plants, the tags are read by a Polytag machine. The number of bottles is then uploaded to a cloud-based app in real time, which Polytag's customers can access.<br/>\"They can see exactly how many bottles are being recycled, which is something these brands never had access to before,\" says Polytag's project manager Rosa Knox-Bradley.<br/>So far the firm has worked with UK retailers Co-Op and Ocado.<br/>To make it easier for people to recycle, and encourage more to do so, the UK government and the administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland are due to launch a deposit return scheme in 2025.<br/>This is due to see \"reverse vending machines\" located in shops and other public areas, where people will be able to deposit used plastic bottles and metal drinks cans, and be paid money for doing so - around 20p per item.<br/>The search to find a planet-friendly way to get rid of rubbish remains a tough race, however, as seemingly every year a new trend comes along to throw a spanner in the works.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>The latest is an addiction to e-cigarettes, or vapes, which are creating a whole new mountain of electronic waste that is hard to recycle.<br/>\"It's a huge problem. And it's getting bigger,\" said Ray Parmenter, head of policy and technical at the Chartered Institute of Waste Management. <br/>He adds that the \"fundamental issue\" is disposable single-use vapes, which he says \"are basically an anathema to the circular economy\".<br/>Disposal vapes are composed of many materials - plastics, metals, a lithium battery and some even have LED lights or microprocessors.<br/>Research last year from Material Focus, an organisation that campaigns for more recycling of electrical products, suggests 1.3 million vapes are thrown away per week in the UK alone. This means that some 10 tons of lithium goes into landfill every year, enough to power 1,200 car batteries.<br/>\"The way we get these critical raw materials like lithium is from deep mines - not the easiest places to get to. So once we've got it out, we need to make the most of it,\" says Mr Parmenter.<br/>Vapes are a good example of how we need to change thinking, says Ms Druckman.<br/>\"It doesn't make economic sense, it doesn't make any sense. Rather than ask how do we recycle them, ask why we have single-use vapes in the first place?\"<br/>While industry and policy-makers have big roles to play in making products more recyclable or reusable, so do consumers, she adds. And the biggest change they can make is to \"consume less\".<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But a BBC investigation tracked one video that has been viewed millions of times - and found the company is struggling to stop false climate information from spreading across the platform.<br/>If you searched for \"climate change\" on TikTok in recent months, you might have come across a video featuring Dan Pe\u00f1a, a self-styled \"business success coach\" with thousands of followers on social media.<br/>The video, shot during the 2017 London premiere of a documentary film about Mr Pe\u00f1a, shows a heated exchange between the American businessman and a member of the audience.<br/>Asked what \"the people with the money\" will do about climate change, he replies: \"The financial institutions and the banks know [climate change] is not going to happen.\"<br/>He adds, without providing any credible evidence: \"It's the greatest fraud that has been perpetrated on mankind this century.\" <br/>Contacted by the BBC, Mr Pe\u00f1a stood by these comments, saying climate change was actually a \"historical norm\" over thousands of years and \"not new\".  He questioned whether it was a \"genuine threat\" as well as the effectiveness of measures proposed by climate change activists in the face of growing emissions from China.  <br/>The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence has found that world temperatures are rising because of human activity, leading to rapid climate change and threatening every aspect of human life.<br/>But while Mr Pe\u00f1a's statements conflict with that scientific evidence, this clip appears to have been edited and re-uploaded by other users from different TikTok accounts dozens of times, racking up more than nine million views in the process. <br/>Under new community guidelines unveiled by TikTok last April, content that \"undermines well-established scientific consensus\" on climate change will not be allowed on the platform. <br/>And yet, the clip depicting Mr Pe\u00f1a is far from an isolated occurrence: the BBC identified 365 different videos in English denying the existence of man-made climate change.  <br/>TikTok itself deems climate change denial to be \"harmful misinformation\". Using tools available to any TikTok user, we reported those videos to the platform under that category. We then waited for at least a day to find out whether they would be taken down. <br/>The company did not remove almost 95% of the posts we flagged up - videos that, having been watched almost 30 million times, appeared to be attracting significant attention. <br/>In a statement to the BBC, TikTok said it is working \"to empower informed climate discussions\", and that it is working with fact-checkers to tackle misinformation. <br/>The company also pointed out that, when users search for videos about climate change, they are being shown a link to a United Nations website on the topic. <br/>But the video of Mr Pe\u00f1a demonstrates how \"bad arguments can spread really fast on TikTok\", says Roshan Salgado D'Arcy, a science communicator who uses social media to debunk viral videos that contain false claims about climate change. <br/>\"There are no real checks and balances to make sure that the information is accurate.\"<br/>The problem is not exclusive to English-speaking TikTok either: BBC Monitoring found dozens of other climate change-denying videos in Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian. <br/>\"As a member of the public on social media, it must be very easy to get the wrong idea about how certain we are about climate change,\" says Dr Doug McNeall, a scientist from the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.<br/>\"Misinformation can really damage our discussion about what to do about climate change.\" <br/>TikTok is aware of the problem - which is why, to mark Earth month in April, it announced it would begin actively removing content that contradicts basic climate science. <br/>In a blog post published at the time, it listed as examples of rule-breaking content posts \"denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it\". <br/>But the reach of videos like those featuring Mr Pe\u00f1a raises questions about how successfully this new policy is being enforced. <br/>\"Rules become irrelevant, if they're not applied consistently, accurately and fairly,\" says Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a UK counter-extremism think tank.<br/>Ms King said this emboldens people to try \"to game the system even more, because they know they can ultimately act with impunity\". <br/>Paul Scully MP, the minister for technology and the digital economy, told the BBC that the government's proposed Online Safety Bill would guarantee that the responsibility of social media platforms to tackle disinformation was \"taken seriously\".<br/>After we shared the findings of our investigation with TikTok, 65 accounts that had been posting wrong information about climate change in breach of the platform's guidelines were permanently removed.  <br/>The company also removed most of the remaining videos that were still online - including several that featured Dan Pe\u00f1a's 2017 talk.  <br/>However, at the time of writing, several copies of the clip featuring Dan Pe\u00f1a describing climate change as the \"greatest fraud\" can still be found on the app. <br/>At the Met Office, Dr McNeall welcomes TikTok's efforts against misinformation, but he questions whether this is a battle the company can win. <br/>\"As a scientist I'm happy to be challenged,\" he says. <br/>\"Maybe we should focus on promoting good climate science information, rather than just removing the content that we perhaps don't like.\"  <br/>The 'ninjas' fighting climate denial on Twitter<br/>A band of volunteers is keeping climate denial off Wikipedia<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

These days pilots have a lot more assistance from tech in the cockpit. <br/>Project Dragonfly, conducted on an Airbus A350-1000, extended the plane's autonomy even further.<br/>The project focused on three areas: improved automatic landing, taxi assistance and automated emergency diversion.<br/>Perhaps the last of those is the most dramatic. <br/>Malcolm Ridley, Chief Test Pilot of Airbus's commercial aircraft, reassured us that the risk of being involved in an air accident is \"vanishingly small\".<br/>However, aircraft and crew need to be ready for any scenario, so Project Dragonfly tested an automatic emergency descent system.<br/>The idea is this technology will take over if the pilots need to focus on heavy decision-making or if they were to become incapacitated. <br/>Under its own control, the plane can descend and land, while recognising other aircraft, weather and terrain.<br/>The system also allows the plane to speak to air traffic control over the radio with a synthetic voice created through the use of artificial intelligence. <br/>It is a lot for the plane's systems to take on. <br/>One of the challenges was teaching the system to understand all of the information and create a solution, says Miguel Mendes Dias, Automated Emergency Operations Designer. <br/>\"The aircraft needs to, on its own, recover all the information. So it needs to listen for the airport messages from air traffic control. <br/>\"Then it needs to choose the most suitable airport for diversion,\" he said. <br/>Project Dragonfly performed two successful emergency descents.<br/>During the test flights, French air traffic controllers fully understood the situation and the aircraft landed safely. <br/>\"It was really an amazing feat,\" says Mr Mendes.<br/>Thankfully, almost all landings are much less dramatic, and Project Dragonfly looked at the more usual kind as well. <br/>Most big airports have technology which guides the aircraft on to the runway, called precision approach. <br/>But not every airport in the world has that tech, so Airbus has been looking at a different way to land. <br/>Project Dragonfly explored using different sensors to help an aircraft make an automated landing.<br/>It included using a combination of normal cameras, infrared and radar technology.<br/>The team also gathered data from around the world, so all sorts of weather conditions could be modelled.<br/>As well as giving the plane more information, the extra sensors give the pilot extra clarity, when monitoring the landing.<br/>For example, infrared cameras are useful in cloudy conditions, as the closer you get to objects the more heat an infrared sensor can pick up.<br/>The tech \"will make the pilot comfortable in the fact that he's really aligned and on the good path to go to the runway,\" says Nuria Torres Mataboch, a computer vision engineer on the Dragonfly project.<br/>Project Dragonfly also looked at taxiing. Although this might seem like a basic task, it can be the most challenging part of the job, especially at the world's busiest airports.<br/>In this case, the pilot was in control of the aircraft.<br/>The technology provided the crew with audio alerts. So when the aircraft came across obstacles it issued an alert. It also advised pilots on speed and showed them the way to the runaway. <br/>\"We wanted something that would assist and reduce the pilots' workloads during the taxi phase,\" said Mr Ridley.<br/>What do pilots make of such developments? Some do not want the technology pushed too far. <br/>\"I don't know if any pilot is particularly comfortable with the computer being the sole arbiter of whether or not a flight successfully lands,\" said Tony Lucas, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, he is not convinced that self-flying planes will be able to deal with complex scenarios that come up.<br/>\"Automation can't replace the decision making of two well-trained and rested pilots on the flight deck,\" he said from his base at Sydney airport. <br/>Mr Lucas used the example of the Boeing 737 Max, where an automated system led to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. <br/>Airbus is quick to point out that further automation will only be introduced when safe and that the objective is not to remove pilots from the cockpit.<br/>But could passenger planes be pilot-free one day?<br/>\"Fully automated aircraft would only ever occur if that was clearly and certainly the safe way to go to protect our passengers and crew,\" says Mr Ridley.<br/>You can watch more on this story on BBC Click.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

What might take a human copywriter between 60 and 90 minutes to write, the AI could do in 10 minutes or less.<br/>Around four months after the AI was introduced, Mr Meadowcroft's four-strong team was laid off.<br/>Mr Meadowcroft can't be certain, but he's pretty sure the AI replaced them.<br/>\"I did laugh-off the idea of AI replacing writers, or affecting my job, until it did,\" he said.<br/>The latest wave of AI hit late last year when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.<br/>Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT can give human-like responses to questions and can, in minutes, generate essays, speeches, even recipes.<br/>Other tech giants are scrambling to launch their own systems - Google launched Bard in March.<br/>While not perfect, such systems are trained on the ocean of data available on the internet - an amount of information impossible for even a team of humans to digest.<br/>So that's left many wondering which jobs might be at risk.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Earlier this year, a report from Goldman Sachs said that AI could potentially replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.<br/>Any job losses would not fall equally across the economy. According to the report, 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance.<br/>The report also points out that the introduction of AI could boost productivity and growth and might create new jobs.<br/>There is some evidence of that already. <br/>This month IKEA said that, since 2021, it has retrained 8,500 staff who worked in its call centres as design advisers.<br/>The furniture giant says that 47% of customer calls are now handled by an AI called Billie. <br/>While IKEA does not see any job losses resulting from its use of AI, such developments are making many people worried.<br/>A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which polled 12,000 workers from around the world, found that a third were worried that they would be replaced at work by AI, with frontline staff more concerned than managers. <br/>Jessica Apotheker from BCG says that's partly due to fear of the unknown. <br/>\"When you look at leaders and managers, we have more than 80% of them that use AI at least on a weekly basis. When you look at frontline staff, that number drops to 20% so with the lack of familiarity with the tech comes much more anxiety and concern on the outcomes for them.\"<br/>But perhaps there is good reason to be anxious.<br/>For three months last year, Alejandro Graue had been doing voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel.<br/>It seemed to be a promising line of work, a whole YouTube channel in English had to be re-voiced in Spanish. <br/>Mr Graue went on holiday late last year confident that there would be work when he returned.<br/>\"I was expecting to have that money to live with - I have two daughters, so I need the money,\" he says.<br/>But to his surprise, before he returned to work, the YouTube channel uploaded a new video in Spanish - one he had not worked on.<br/>\"When I clicked on it, what I heard was not my voice, but an AI generated voice - a very badly synced voiceover. It was terrible. And I was like, What is this? Is this like going to be my new partner in crime like the channel? Or is this going to replace me?\" he says.<br/>A phone call to the studio he worked for confirmed the worst. The client wanted to experiment with AI because it was cheaper and faster.<br/>That experiment turned out to be a failure. Viewers complained about the quality of the voiceover and eventually the channel took down the videos that featured the AI-generated voice.<br/>But Mr Graue did not find that very comforting. He thinks the technology will only improve and wonders where that will leave voiceover artists like him.<br/>\"If this starts to happen in every job that I have, what should I do? Should I buy a farm? I don't know.  What other job could I look for that is not going to be replaced as well in the future? It's very complicated,\" he says.<br/>If AI is not coming for your job then it is likely you might have to start working with one in some way.<br/>After a few months of freelance work, former copywriter Dean Meadowcroft took a new direction.<br/>He now works for an employee assistance provider, which gives wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. Working with AI is now part of his job.<br/>\"I think that is where the future is for AI, giving quick access to human-led content, as opposed to completely eliminating that human aspect,\" he says.<br/>You can see the full interviews with Dean Meadowcroft and Alejandro Graue on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC News.<br/>Viewers in the UK can watch on BBC iPlayer from 11:30 on Saturday.

I asked him if it's good to be tailoring again and he gives me a big smile.<br/>Mr Zaitoun's work is a small part of Amsterdam's effort to become a circular economy.<br/>A traditional industrial economy uses raw materials to make products which are discarded when they are no longer wanted, sometimes before the end of their useful lives. <br/>The circular economy aims to break the link between economic activity and using up the earth's resources. This may involve reusing, repairing, and sharing materials and products. <br/>\"Circularity is the hottest topic in the fashion industry right now,\" says Thami Schweichler, chief executive at URC, an organisation he set up through his social enterprise Makers Unite, a creative textile platform.<br/>\"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable. Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

People who would kill him.<br/>\"This is the only game I've ever seen that actually confuses my brain into thinking it's real,\" reads the top comment below the YouTube video of gameplay from Unrecord, an upcoming title by French indie game studio Drama.<br/>The video chalked up millions of views in just a few weeks and caused a sensation in the games industry. Some commentators on social media questioned if it really was a game and, if so, whether it was actually a little too real - too raw - an experience.<br/>Drama declined an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We are currently busy with investors and publishers.\"<br/>But graphics in many different games have been getting noticeably more sophisticated, arguably approaching what's known as \"photorealism\" - indistinguishable from photos or videos of the real world.<br/>The Unrecord demo looks so lifelike partly thanks to some clever techniques, says Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analytics.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points to the shaky camera, which imitates actual crime scene footage. The dull lighting, grittiness and urban bustle audible in the background all help, too.<br/>But could it make some people uncomfortable?<br/>\"That setting for it is quite reminiscent of some of the more horrendous footage you get out of real life,\" notes Mr Harding-Rolls. <br/>In a statement posted on Twitter, Drama said the game is not inspired by specific real-life events.<br/>Also, look closely at still images from the video and it's possible to see some objects and textures that don't look realistic at all. This might not matter - but it does undermine the idea that the game is photorealistic.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points out that, in general, advances in graphics matter for the games industry: \"Consumers definitely want that. They love looking at things and thinking, 'Wow, this looks amazing'.\"<br/>Rachel McDonnell, professor in creative technologies, Trinity College Dublin agrees that the Unrecord video is impressive, though she notes that certain character animations are a little clunky.<br/>They call to mind the movement of characters in other games falling over and dying in pre-programmed sequences.<br/>\"Animation hasn't caught up with the rendering at all in games yet,\" she says, adding that crowds are particularly tricky to make lifelike.<br/>\"You'll still see them doing very strange behaviour, running around in circles and getting stuck - that instantly breaks you from your presence in the game.\"<br/>Experiments she and her colleagues have conducted suggest that, for players' immersion in games, how an on-screen character looks is much less important than how they move.<br/>Marc Whitten, president of Create Solutions at game software firm Unity notes that today's most realistic content relies on highly-detailed 3D modelling of objects.<br/>Last year, Unity showed off a computer generated clip of a lion and its cub featuring two million individually rendered strands of fur.<br/>\"If you don't do that, it does not come across as photorealism,\" argues Mr Whitten. The firm has also developed highly lifelike models of humans, where digital puppetry controls their subtle facial expressions.<br/>There's still room for improvement, he adds. There are many other difficult-to-simulate materials, such as clothing, which are still a long way from looking photorealistic in games.<br/>One important emerging technology for game graphics is neural radiance fields, or NeRFs. California-based Luma AI specialises in this and says it already has customers using the tech to make games.<br/>A NeRF is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can represent objects or scenery captured in photographs or video footage in the real world. <br/>\"When you show it these images from different sides, the network learns how light is bouncing off of everything,\" explains Luma AI co-founder Amit Jain. \"It measures light and it learns from light.\"<br/>The way light reflects off a motorbike's leather seat versus a headlamp, for example, is completely different and simulating that in a game is very challenging. Nerfs could help to automate the process.<br/>Some of the best game graphics today use what's known as ray-tracing - accurate simulations of the way light bounces off surfaces or creates glowing effects around neon signs and so on. <br/>AI is making it possible to produce these effects in games despite only modest improvements in chip performance, says Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research, Nvidia.<br/>\"We have to be smarter in how we construct the world and how we render it,\" he explains.<br/>A new mode for Cyberpunk 2077, an action-adventure game, called Ray Tracing: Overdrive, demonstrates the difference this can make.<br/>Nvidia says its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology allows developers to create high resolution, high frame-rate graphics featuring ray-tracing with the help of AI.<br/>\"The model's trained to know what things in the real-world look like,\" explains Mr Catanzaro.<br/>Games are increasingly difficult to tell apart from real life at times, says Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering, Epic Games.<br/>However he says it is still very hard to render certain materials convincingly - such as an iridescent layer of oil on a puddle of water.<br/>\"Those are aspects that we don't yet have the power to simulate in real time,\" he says.<br/>And doing that on games consoles or home PCs is what matters. For movies featuring computer generated imagery, it's possible to use huge computers and take many minutes or more to render individual frames.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The most popular games of the future might not need to be photorealistic. Consider Minecraft or Epic's own Fortnite - both enormously successful, both very far from photoreal. <br/>Improved lighting effects and material simulations help artists working on all kinds of games, though, argues Mr Penwarden. It can give stylised or cartoonish environments more depth and complexity, too.<br/>\"One of the great benefits about having the ability to do photoreal images is the tech can start to do a lot of the work for you,\" he says.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes<br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\"<br/>Inside the routine at Elizabeth Holmes' prison<br/>Elizabeth Holmes to begin jail sentence this month<br/>The prison experience Holmes is desperate to avoid<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

And it would take less time than Kenneth Branagh's film version of Hamlet.<br/>\"We can do this in less than four hours,\" explains Raymond Decorvet, who works in business development at MAN ES. \"Or we could freeze the whole thing in about 11 hours.\"<br/>Theirs is among the largest heat pump units in the world. Heat pumps work by compressing gently warmed refrigerants to raise the temperature of these fluids. That heat can then be passed on to homes or industrial machinery.<br/>Heat pumps require electricity to work but can produce around three or four kilowatt hours of heat for every kilowatt hour of power they consume.<br/>Heat pumps are increasingly popular with some home owners but domestic devices are relatively small and tend to have outputs of several kilowatts or so. MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat.

There has been extensive (and controversial) testing of the chips on animals. <br/>A complaint filed in February to the US Department of Agriculture alleged cruel treatment of macaque monkeys who are being used to test the technology. <br/>The fact that the FDA has approved the start of human testing, however, implies the company has overcome some of the challenges. <br/>Maybe the more serious concerns come around the long-term consequences of having a device like this operating within the human brain, a vastly complex organ we are only beginning to understand. <br/>Understandably there is no data as to what the potential harms may be. That will change with testing on humans and will be key to the development of similar products. <br/>The final element, ethical safety, is more subjective. Technology like this is riven with concerns about data protection, potential uses and the possibility of human enhancement. <br/>This means augmenting or enhancing the capabilities of the human brain beyond what we are currently capable of doing. For example, improving human cognition, sensory perception, or physical abilities. This always stirs strong emotions and raises ethical questions so there will be calls for close regulation of the sector.<br/>The firm was founded in California by Elon Musk and a team of seven scientists and engineers in 2016.  But of last year, of the eight cofounders, only two remained at the company.<br/>Elon Musk brings an entrepreneurial approach to tackling an issue which many see as fundamentally scientific. He also inevitably brings something else - publicity. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial people on the planet. <br/>When he speaks, generally people listen and react. His involvement in Neuralink is one of the reasons people are talking about it today. <br/>Yes, quite a few are, with some said to be further on in their research than Neuralink. Black Rock Neuro Tech are working on a similar product, also implanting chips into the human brain. <br/>There's lots of different work being done, however, not all of it so invasive. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, are thought to be working on wearable tech that would allow people to type with their minds. <br/>Last week news emerged of a paralysed man helped to walk again by Swiss scientists. In short, this is a rapidly expanding field with many players. <br/>Elon Musk's involvement guarantees that Neuralink will often win the race for publicity, but that will not ultimately decide which firms succeed. <br/>That will come down to which technology works best and who can prove to regulators and markets that it is safe. <br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging. While Graphcore too has software to make its technology accessible, it is hard to orchestrate a switch when the world has built its AI products to run on Nvidia GPUs. <br/>Mr Toon hopes that over time, as AI moves away from cutting-edge experimentation to commercial deployment, cost-efficient computation will start to become more important.<br/>Back at Nvidia, Ian Buck is not overly concerned about the competition. <br/>\"Everyone has the need for AI now,\" he says. \"It is up to others to work out where they are going to make a contribution.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

And there is already the possibility that current restrictions on semiconductor exports to China could hamper Beijing's technological progress.<br/>But China could catch up, according to analysts, as AI solutions take years to be perfected. Chinese internet companies \"are arguably more advanced than US internet companies, depending on how you're measuring advancement,\" Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Trivium China tells the BBC.<br/>However, she says China's \"ability to manufacture high-end equipment and components is an estimated 10 to 15 years behind global leaders.\"<br/>The US' biggest advantage is Silicon Valley, arguably the world's supreme entrepreneurial hotspot. It is the birthplace of technology giants such as Google, Apple and Intel that have helped shape modern life.<br/>Innovators in the country have been helped by its unique research culture, says Pascale Fung, director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.<br/>Researchers often spend years working to improve a technology without a product in mind, Ms Fung says.<br/>OpenAI, for example, operated as a non-profit company for years as it researched the Transformers machine learning model, which eventually powered ChatGPT.<br/>\"This environment never existed in most Chinese companies. They would build deep learning systems or large language models only after they saw the popularity,\" she adds. \"This is a fundamental challenge to Chinese AI.\"<br/>US investors have also been supportive of the country's research push. In 2019, Microsoft said it would put $1bn (\u00a3810m) in to OpenAI.<br/>\"AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time and has the potential to help solve many of our world's most pressing challenges,\" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said.<br/>China, meanwhile, benefits from a larger consumer base. It is the world's second-most populous country, home to roughly 1.4 billion people.<br/>It also has a thriving internet sector, says Edith Yeung, a partner at the Race Capital investment firm.<br/>Nearly everyone in the country uses the super app WeChat, for example. It is used for almost everything from sending text messages, to booking doctor's appointments and filing taxes.<br/>As a result, there's a wealth of information that can be used to improve products. \"The AI model is going to be only as good as the data that is available for it to learn from,\" Ms Yeung says.<br/>\"For good or bad, China has a lot less rules around privacy, and a lot more data [compared to the US]. There's CCTV facial recognition everywhere, for example,\" she adds. \"Imagine how useful that would be for AI-generated images.\"<br/>While China's tech community may appear to be lagging behind the US, its developers have an edge, according to Lee Kai-Fu, who makes the argument in his book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.<br/>\"They live in a world where speed is essential, copying is an accepted practice, and competitors will stop at nothing to win a new market,\" wrote Mr Lee, a prominent figure in Beijing's internet sector and the former head of Google China.<br/>\"This rough-and-tumble environment makes a strong contrast to Silicon Valley, where copying is stigmatised and many companies are allowed to coast on the basis of one original idea or lucky break.\"<br/>China's copycat era has its problems, including serious issues around intellectual property. Mr Lee writes that it has led to a generation of hardy and nimble entrepreneurs ready to compete.<br/>Since the 1980s, China has been expanding its economy, which used to be based mainly on manufacturing, to one that is technology-based, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"In the last decade, we have seen more innovation from Chinese consumer-driven internet companies and high-end Chinese designs,\" she adds.<br/>While Chinese tech companies certainly have unique advantages, the full impact of Beijing's authoritarianism is still unclear.<br/>There are questions, for instance, about whether censorship would affect development of Chinese AI chatbots. Will they be able to answer sensitive questions about President Xi Jinping?<br/>\"I don't think anyone in China will ask controversial questions on Baidu or Ernie in the first place. They know it's censored,\" Ms Yeung says. \"Sensitive topics are a very small part of the usage [of chatbots]. They just get more media attention,\" Ms Fung adds.<br/>The bigger concern is that US attempts to restrict China's access to specialised tech can stymie the latter's AI industry.<br/>High-performing computer chips, or semiconductors, are now the source of much tension between Washington and Beijing. They are used in everyday products including laptops and smartphones, and could have military applications. They are also crucial to the hardware required for AI learning.<br/>US companies like Nvidia currently have the lead in developing AI chips and \"few [Chinese] companies can compete against ChatGPT\" given export restrictions, Ms Fung says.<br/>While this will hit China's high-tech industries like cutting edge AI, it won't affect the production of consumer technology, such as mobiles and laptops. This is because \"the export controls are designed to prevent China from developing advanced AI for military purposes,\" Ms Schaefer says.<br/>To overcome this, China needs its own Silicon Valley - a research culture that attracts talent from diverse backgrounds, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"So far it has relied on both domestic talent and those from overseas with Chinese heritage. There is a limit to homogeneous cultural thinking,\" she adds.<br/>Beijing has been trying to close the gap through its \"Big Fund\", which offers massive incentives to chip companies.<br/>But it has also tightened its grip on the sector. In March, Zhao Weiguo became the latest technology tycoon to be accused of corruption by authorities.<br/>Beijing's focus on certain industries can bring financial incentives and loosen red tape, but it may also mean greater scrutiny, and more fear and uncertainty.<br/>\"Zhao's arrest is a message for other state-owned firms: don't mess around with state money, particularly in the chip space,\" Ms Schaefer says. \"Now it's time to get on with the job.\"<br/>How that message will affect the future of China's AI industry remains to be seen.<br/>China bans major US chip maker from key projects<br/>China tech giant Alibaba to roll out ChatGPT rival<br/>OpenAI announces ChatGPT successor GPT-4<br/>Students warned against using AI for assignments<br/>'Google killer' ChatGPT sparks AI chatbot race<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Huge arrays of angled solar panels sit atop jet black steel supports, soaking up the sun and shading the vehicles beneath. <br/>Outside the offices of a major car manufacturer in the south of England, there are now more than 2,000 panels in total with a peak capacity of just under 1 megawatt (MW).<br/>That's enough to power hundreds of homes.<br/>\"They are looking stunning,\" declares Guy Chilvers, business development manager at SIG, the firm that supplied the solar canopies.<br/>These structures make car parks more visually appealing, he insists, while admitting, \"I would say that\".<br/>Solar car parks or car ports enable electricity production in open spaces that tend to be positioned conveniently near to energy-guzzling facilities such as hospitals, shopping centres or offices. The canopies have additional benefits in that they protect cars from rain and snow, or hot sun in the summer.<br/>In a drive to boost clean energy production, the French Senate recently approved legislation that makes it mandatory for all existing and new car parks with 80 spaces or more to be covered by solar panels. <br/>While there is no equivalent requirement in the UK, solar car parks have been around for years and there are signs that they are beginning to boom here. With electricity prices currently still elevated, many businesses are turning to on-site renewables to try to keep costs down in the long run. <br/>There is a huge opportunity to turn more British car parks into solar farms, according to a new report published by the countryside charity CPRE and the UCL Energy Institute.<br/>\"We think the total potential in the built environment is about 117GW,\" says Prof Mark Barrett of UCL. \"And of that, 11GW, we think, is car parks.\"<br/>For context, the UK currently has around 15GW of solar capacity in total and requires 40GW by 2030 in order to meet net zero targets, according to Solar Energy UK.<br/>Prof Barrett notes that the figure of 11GW is conservative and is based on an estimate of 130 sq km of available car parks in the UK - lower than the 200 sq km estimated by estate agents Knight Frank. The CPRE and UCL report also assumed that 50% of each individual car park would be covered by a canopy rather than 100%.<br/>Whichever way you look at it, there's plenty of space out there in car parks for solar panels and people are beginning to realise this. <br/>\"It's absolutely gone crazy,\" says Mr Chilvers, referring to his inbox. Lately, he's quoted for hotels, hospitals and leisure centres. Mr Chilvers and his colleagues design and build the steel structures for solar canopies while the panels are supplied separately.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Rival companies that spoke to the BBC also described high demand for solar car park canopies.<br/>Praxia Energy, based in Spain, supplies about 3MW of car park solar installations in the UK each year and says it expects this to grow tenfold by 2028. <br/>A spokeswoman for Veolia says the company recently installed a 1.1MW solar canopy system in the car park of Eastbourne Hospital and the firm has registered increased demand for solar infrastructure in the UK lately. <br/>Solarsense, a company in Clevedon, says it has also received rising enquiries in recent months.<br/>Tim Evans, chief executive of 3ti, argues that, in the past, the UK has been slow to pursue this technology in comparison with countries on the continent. \"We are quite some way behind the curve,\" he says.<br/>There are some flagship examples already in place, though. The largest solar car park installed to date in the UK is the one at the Bentley car factory in Crewe, which has a peak capacity of 2.7MW. <br/>Mr Evans says he is currently exploring four new potential projects with clients that could exceed 5MW peak capacity.<br/>Solar panels in car parks can also power electric vehicle (EV) charging. This works especially well at offices, where employees' cars are parked outside for many hours. Shopping centres, football stadiums, leisure centres and cinemas are also suitable venues, since cars tend to be parked for two hours or more to allow sufficient charging, says Mr Evans. <br/>But the steel supports required for many solar canopies do add to the cost. It is often cheaper to simply put solar panels on the roof of large buildings, such as supermarkets. Mr Evans estimates that rooftop solar yields electricity at about 9p per kWh currently, versus 14p or 15p per kWh from panels in car parks.<br/>There aren't many other obvious downsides to the canopies, though, says Richard Watkins at the University of Kent. He notes that installers might want to fit them with efficient under-canopy lighting so that they don't result in dark, potentially dangerous spaces at night.<br/>One hiccup facing many renewable energy projects at the moment is a lack of grid connections, since surplus energy generated by solar panels, for example, must be handled by the grid. Billions of pounds worth of renewable installations are effectively on hold because of this issue, according to BBC research.<br/>\"I've just had a megawatt car park, beautiful car park, for a factory turned down because it can't get a grid connection,\" says Mr Chilvers. <br/>A spokesman for Solar Energy UK also highlights this problem, saying that solar car parks becoming a common sight will remain a \"distant prospect\" until it is resolved.<br/>The energy industry regulator Ofgem is looking at ways to speed up connections and National Grid also has a plan to improve the process.<br/>There are lots of other locations around the UK, besides car parks, that could also accommodate solar installations and help us ditch fossil fuels, notes Prof Sara Walker at Newcastle University. Cycle paths and railways, for instance, or reservoirs that can be covered with floating solar panels. These also help reduce the evaporative loss of water from reservoirs.<br/>\"Where we can co-locate solar photovoltaics alongside infrastructure that would be there anyway, like a car park, it enables us to get double use out of the land surface,\" she says.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

On inspection, the gel has been pushed around a bit but, amazingly, is still intact.<br/>What's important is that the metal plate behind the gel is not damaged. Without the gel the basalt would have torn a chunk out of the plate.<br/>Talin can absorb force thanks to unique mechanical properties. Its structure includes spirals of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - which form bundles. When pulled the bundles unfurl, increasing the length of the protein by a factor of 10.<br/>When the stress is released the bundles snap back into their original position, kind of like a spring.<br/>Prof Ben Goult worked out the structure of talin and how it responds to forces and, with his colleague Prof Jennifer Hiscock, they came up with the idea of making talin into a shock-absorbing material.<br/>\"I literally wandered into Ben's office and he was talking about his wonderful protein. And I said we have to make a bulletproof vest - this is what we have to do,\" she says.<br/>Starting in 2016 their team developed a way to join the talin proteins together into a lattice - like a net with an almost cartoon-like ability to stretch and rebound.<br/>It's been a long haul for Prof Goult who has been involved with working out the mechanical properties of talin and its structure since 2005.<br/>\"It wasn't easy. It took a team of six of us over four years to work out the protein structure of talin, and another four years to work out how talin responded to force\" he says.<br/>Proteins are complicated molecules to decipher. They are made up of a chain of amino acids, a bit like beads on a string. There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids - or beads - so there are a bewildering number of ways they can combine. <br/>Traditionally working out those structures was done using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a process which could take years.<br/>But in recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised the process, predicting the structures of hundreds of millions of proteins.<br/>A key event came in November 2020, when AlphaFold performed best at CASP 14, an assessment every two years where different computer programs predict the structure of proteins. <br/>Not only did AlphaFold outperform rival systems, it predicted the structure of the proteins with a level of accuracy way beyond its rivals.<br/>\"That was pretty crazy,\" says Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, who helped develop AlphaFold, along with others at London-based DeepMind, the AI division of Alphabet, the parent company of Google.<br/>\"We knew that we had pretty good results internally going into that CASP. But it wasn't at all clear whether other people would have similar results. It was, I guess, a bit of a surprise to us to see just how large the margin was compared to other groups,\" says Ms Tunyasuvunakool.<br/>That version of AlphaFold - AlphaFold2 - was so good, that in the next competition all the best performing teams used versions of it. <br/>Thanks to AlphaFold and its offspring the database of protein structures has gone from a few hundred thousand to hundreds of millions.<br/>For scientists and researchers, particularly in drug development, this is a bonanza. Proteins with structures that look promising for certain uses, like binding to a cancer cell, can be identified more quickly than ever before - the pace of research has been accelerated.<br/>But even AlphaFold has its limitations. Proteins often work by interacting with other molecules and at the moment AlphaFold can only predict the protein part.<br/>And as Prof Goult discovered with talin, proteins are dynamic molecules that change form. AlphaFold can gives researchers a static picture, but can't model those changes.<br/>Also, scientists might also want to design proteins from scratch, to do specific tasks. That's the focus of Prof David Baker, head of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, just outside Seattle.<br/>His team has developed an artificial intelligence based on DALL-E, an AI which generates original images.<br/>Called RF Diffusion, it was trained by breaking down known proteins and then reassembling them in steps. <br/>Scientists using RF Diffusion decide on a particular characteristic they want from a new protein - perhaps a catalyst for a certain kind of chemical reaction, or a protein that can bind to a particular target.<br/>They can feed their requirements into RF Diffusion and it will come up with a suitable protein structure.<br/>\"I think RF diffusion is a step change compared to what we had before,\" says Prof Baker.<br/>\"The potential of designing proteins that solve so many different problems is really great,\" he adds.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Industry might benefit from catalysts which can speed up reactions or make them more efficient.<br/>Plus, according to Prof Baker, whole new materials could emerge. For him, the possibilities make protein research a compelling place to work. <br/>\"It's an extremely exciting area right now. For young scientists just starting out on a career, it's probably one of the most exciting areas in science today,\" he says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Back in Kent, Professors Goult and Hiscock are working on scaling up production of their protein talin, with investment coming from the Ministry of Defence.<br/>The idea is to make enough of their shock-absorbing gel for a much bigger test. The Kent scientists think that one day their gel might be able to reduce the amount of heavy ceramic used in today's bulletproof plates. <br/>For now, Prof Hiscock still marvels at how their protein gel comes together.<br/>\"It's a beautiful process, the spontaneity of it, and the fact that all those molecules can come together to form those fibrous networks.\" <br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Star Jen Shah is serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence there for wire fraud.<br/>The celebrity entrepreneur might have roommates in prison. Inmates are typically housed in dormitory-style two-person bunk beds, and four to eight person cubicles, according to Pink Lady Prison Consultants, a prison consulting group led by formerly incarcerated people. <br/>Life at the federal facility is centred around work and extracurricular programmes, the prison handbook says. <br/>All inmates are expected to work, and earn between 12 cents and $1.15 (\u00a30.90) an hour for their jobs. Many are involved in food service and factory work. <br/>Outside of their work, female inmates can take classes on business skills and foreign languages, watch television, play sports and go to religious services, according to the handbook.<br/>Holmes would be allotted an hour for each meal at the facility, which offers a standard Federal Bureau of Prisons menu, consisting of foods like chicken, hamburgers, hotdogs, tacos and macaroni. <br/>As per the prison handbook, she could speak to her family via video calls. Inmates are also allowed visitors during weekends and holidays, but like other inmates, Holmes would be allowed limited physical contact with her partner and young children.<br/>Rules at the female-only facility are also strict, the handbook says, adding that inmates are \"treated in a mature and responsible manner\" and are \"expected to act accordingly\". <br/>Inmates can face disciplinary measures for a number of actions, including not keeping their cell or room neat, sleeping past the early designated wake-up hour, sharing their phone account with other inmates, and leaving an area during an official inmate rollcall, which happens five times a day. <br/>Holmes' time behind bars will stand in stark contrast to her past life. Once lauded as the \"next Steve Jobs\", the start-up founder was said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire, making the cover of Forbes and other prominent magazines. <br/>She started Theranos shortly after dropping out of Stanford University. As the leader of the company, she raised millions of dollars from high-profile investors, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.<br/>But the start-up fell apart in 2018 after it was revealed Holmes and other executives had lied about the company's technology. The blood-testing device was purported to be able to run a multitude of tests from just a few drops of blood.<br/>In addition to serving time in prison, Holmes has been ordered to pay $452m to the victims of her fraud. She will split the amount with her former romantic and business partner, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, who started serving a 13-year sentence in prison in April. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes<br/>The prison experience Holmes is desperate to avoid<br/>Elizabeth Holmes to begin jail sentence this month<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

So his grandparents gave him $200 (\u00a3159) Apple credit for Christmas.<br/>\"To my shock, he spent all of it in a matter of days,\" says Ms Ward. \"After that, I gave him no more than $10 worth of robux per month. He quickly became frustrated and bored with the game.\" <br/>Leif moved on to World of Tanks, which also requires players to upgrade their weaponry using PlayStation credit. <br/>\"However, this game has the option to watch ads to gain credit,\" says Ms Ward. \"He would do that out of desperation when he had used up his monthly gaming allowance.\"<br/>Ms Ward says her younger son has yet to learn self-control or money-sense. <br/>\"It's something that I have to police constantly.\"<br/>Rather than profiting from the initial sale of a video game, many of today's gaming companies rely on revenue generated by in-game purchases, or microtransactions.<br/>The content purchased can be purely aesthetic - dance moves, skins or clothing. <br/>Alternatively, in-game purchases can provide a tactical advantage to the gameplay - extra lives, character upgrades or weapons - providing a lead over players who did not purchase the additional content.<br/>The global online microtransaction market is forecast to grow from $67.94bn in 2022 to $76.66bn in 2023.<br/>However, there are signs of a backlash from experts and consumers alike. Also, some companies are promising new releases that are in-game purchase-free.<br/>Gaming companies use behavioural psychology to manipulate users into spending, says Prof Sarah Mills, and the link between gaming and gambling is becoming \"increasingly blurred\", she explains.<br/>Ms Mills is professor of human geography at Loughborough University. Her research found gambling techniques make gamers play for longer and spend more money, and drive repeat buying.<br/>Vicki Shotbolt, chief executive of Parent Zone, an organisation which helps parents navigate the digital world for their children, is more specific about how games incentivise players to part with their money.<br/>By spending players can \"avoid the grind\" - where making an in-game purchase means you avoid hours of monotonous gaming to progress to another level.<br/>\"Fun pain\" is where you risk losing something important if you don't make a purchase.<br/>Meanwhile, \"obfuscation techniques\", like in-game currencies, make it hard to see how much you're really spending.<br/>Another tactic is the use of \"loot boxes\". Players buy a box without knowing what's inside. It could contain a game-changing item - but more often than not the prize is nothing more than a mediocre customisation. <br/>\"Young people recalled senses of shame when they reflected on the amount they spent trying to gain a rare item, even if they were successful,\" says Prof Mills.<br/>And - despite many children saying they dislike in-game purchasing - spending money on microtransactions has become an expectation.<br/>While spending on games has risen, some argue that playing games can benefit young people and fears are exaggerated.<br/>Gaming as a form of play has been found to relieve stress, help develop cognitive skills and combat loneliness.<br/>As a teenager Zhenghua Yang, from Colorado, spent two years in hospital.<br/>\"I played a lot of video games. The single-player games made me feel like a hero. The multiplayer games connected me to other people. I made life-long friends all over the world.\"<br/>In 2014, Mr Yang founded Serenity Forge, a gaming company on a mission to help others. To date, more than 20 million people have played the firm's games.<br/>\"We are in the business of expanding people's horizons,\" says Mr Yang.<br/>Serenity Forge does not use microtransactions but, says Mr Yang, that could change in the future if they found them to contribute to \"meaningful, emotionally impactful games that challenge the way you think\".<br/>The impact of microtransactions, says Mr Yang, depends on the vulnerability of the user.<br/>\"Like a credit card can be dangerous for someone in an inappropriate context, so too can microtransactions. However, credit cards can also serve an important function and in-game purchases can be important to a gamer engaging with their favourite game.\"<br/>Sarah Loya's son Andrew, 14, spends almost all his pocket money on gaming but, she says, that isn't a problem and gaming makes him happy.<br/>\"He plays daily, after school and on the weekends. I don't really see much of a negative. He's a smart kid and knows the difference between reality and fantasy.\"<br/>Ms Loya lives in Texas with Andrew, and his brother Rex, 6.<br/>\"My bank account is linked to Andrew's subscription, so I would see if he purchased something without permission,\" says the 43-year-old, \"but he always asks me before making a purchase.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>While it can be difficult for parents to keep track of registered emails, passwords and payment cards across various platforms and devices - there are ways that you can protect your teen and your bank account.<br/>Child accounts and parental controls can be used to disable purchases or set a spending limit. Parents can set up email notifications to flag purchases, and use gift cards rather than credit cards.<br/>Perhaps most importantly, adds Mr Yang, talk to your child.<br/>\"In my experience, friction stems from a lack of parental presence,\" he says. \"I now have two kids and, instead of using games as a babysitting tool, I make sure I'm present in their lives as they consume media.\"<br/>Back in Barbados, Ms Ward has set up screen time limits and passcodes to keep Leif gaming safely. <br/>\"My password is needed to make any purchases and if he wants money added to his account he has to ask me.

In a bid to encourage homeowners to decarbonise their heating, Germany introduced a rebate scheme in January 2023 that offers up to 40% back on the cost of buying and installing a heat pump. <br/>Heat pumps use energy taken from the air, water or ground to provide both heating and cooling. They have been proven to work even in extreme temperatures and can drastically reduce energy bills once installed.<br/>The scheme is just one of a host of heat pump subsidies in place across Europe and part of a broader push to reduce carbon emissions. From 2024, every new heating system installed in Germany must run on 65% renewable energy.<br/>Bastian Distler, a product manager in Ketsch in south-west Germany, was considering upgrading to a heat pump anyway for environmental reasons, but admits that he wouldn't have been able to without the subsidy. Purchase and installation can cost anywhere from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac30,000 (\u00a38,700 to \u00a326,000; $11,000 to $33,000) compared to around \u20ac7,000 for a new gas boiler.<br/>\"I have two little children which makes you question some behaviours and you feel better if you do something good for the environment. But to be very honest, if it had been very, very expensive and it didn't pay off, I probably would not have done it,\" says Mr Distler.<br/>While the scheme is certainly making it easier for Germans to invest in heating system upgrades, heat pump sales were already on the increase. <br/>\"We had a market growth of 53% last year,\" says Martin Sabel, managing director of the German Heat Pump Association. \"The year before it was around 30% and the year before that around 40%. So we've had a good growth rate for several years now.\"<br/>The dramatic uptick in demand caught many manufacturers off guard, leaving some homeowners waiting up to 10 months before their new heat pumps could be supplied and installed by trained technicians, who are also in short supply.<br/>Manufacturers like Viessmann are scaling up production to solve the shortfall, as well as pouring huge investment into training installers, providing educational materials for would-be buyers, and helping customers navigate often complex subsidy applications.<br/>G\u00fcnther Schlachter, vice president of residential electric solutions at Viessmann, believes that supporting and training installers is key to decarbonising home heating. <br/>\"Our installer... can consult with their customers [and advise against] the cheapest gas or oil option to make use of the subsidies that are now in place for a future-proof solution,\" says Mr Schlachter.<br/>J\u00fcrgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danfoss agrees. \"Typically, installers focus on gas. For a heat pump, they need to also understand electrics and refrigeration. So educating the end user is important, but it's more important to educate the person selling the system because 80% of the decision-making process happens with the installer.\"<br/>Most European countries currently face the same issues with supply, installer training and cost, but geography and culture also heavily influence what we expect and demand from our heating systems.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>So perhaps it is not surprising that Europe's coldest countries, with the best insulation, have the highest heat pump penetration. According to the International Energy Agency, 60% of Norway's buildings are fitted with a heat pump, followed closely by Sweden at 43% and Finland at 41%. <br/>In Germany the figure is a little over 4% and in the UK just 1%.<br/>\"Scandinavia is much more advanced because they have higher insulation standards and moved from direct electric heating to heat pumps early because it's saved them from day one,\" says Thomas Nowak, secretary general of the European Heat Pump Association.<br/>Central Europeans also tend to have high expectations of heating and insulation whereas people in the UK have long accepted the need for draught excluders and chunky indoor jumpers.<br/>Southern countries tend to eschew heating in favour of cooling and use instantaneous gas boilers to heat water, whereas Eastern Europeans often rely on solid fuel stoves. <br/>Regardless of where you live or how old your building is, there's an easy way to find out if your home is suitable for a heat pump. <br/>If you can feel comfortable at home when the flow temperature on your boiler is reduced to 55C, then you can install a heat pump straight away without retrofits or insulation upgrades. <br/>Of course, not everyone can choose how their home is heated. Germany has one of the lowest home ownership rates in Europe, which means the onus is on landlords and housing management companies to upgrade heating to serve the country's approximately 40 million tenants. <br/>The German Heat Pump Association has seen housing providers begin to understand that decarbonisation will soon begin to affect their bottom line. <br/>\"They have the goal of decarbonising their building stock because they realise that if they don't, in 10 or 20 years, they won't be able to rent these flats anymore,\" says Martin Sabel. <br/>Tenants who would prefer to take matters into their own hands may soon be able to access smaller-scale heat pump solutions for heating and cooling individual rooms.<br/>US start-up Gradient hopes to enter the European market in 2023 and is working on producing small, affordable, self-install heat pumps that fit over window sills and can replace existing air conditioning units. <br/>For Viessmann, the long-term vision is to build a holistic low-carbon, low-cost energy system where heat pumps, high-quality insulation, solar energy, rerouted waste heat, other renewables, and smart technology work in tandem to provide a circular system of heating and cooling, charging cars, and meeting other energy needs for homeowners and their wider community. <br/>Germany may still be a long way from that, but heat pumps are a good step on that road. When asked what message homeowners should take home about heat pumps, Thomas Nowak has a simple answer. <br/>\"They work. That's all. Don't trust anybody who tells you they don't.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But that is changing. <br/>Operators are increasingly adopting turbines designed to withstand tropical cyclones. One of the latest examples is a \"typhoon-resistant\" floating wind turbine, which will soon help to power an offshore oil platform in China. <br/>According to the manufacturer, MingYang Smart Energy, this 7.25 megawatt (MW) turbine can survive wind speeds of up to 134mph for 10 minutes. It has been installed at a facility 136km off the coast of the island province of Hainan.<br/>MingYang did not respond to a BBC request for comment but theirs is not the first turbine designed to face down such an onslaught. In 2021, US firm GE received typhoon-certification for its mammoth Haliade-X turbine. It is fixed, not floating, and has a capacity of up to 13MW.<br/>The blistering growth of the wind energy industry is pushing turbines to their limits and some question whether the pace of the rollout is wise.<br/>While components such as turbine blades are remarkably strong, they are not indestructible. And the forces of nature, especially out at sea, are notoriously unpredictable, meaning the pressure is on to prove that wind turbines really are hurricane-ready.<br/>Tropical cyclones - often called typhoons or hurricanes depending on location - are a familiar threat in certain parts of the world, including in the Gulf of Mexico or around much of Southeast Asia.<br/>Such storms can produce wind speeds well in excess of 100mph. The strongest one-minute sustained winds on record, of 215mph, were created by Hurricane Patricia in the Eastern Pacific in 2015. <br/>Despite the meteorological challenges in such regions, the expansion of wind energy is expected there in the coming years and decades.<br/>Today's turbines already put up with some powerful gales. Those positioned off the northeast coast of the UK in the North Sea operate in wind speeds of up to 50mph or so, after which point they are switched off, notes Simon Hogg at Durham University, who holds the \u00d8rsted chair at the university, which is funded by energy firm \u00d8rsted. <br/>Technically, such turbines are designed to survive even higher wind speeds.<br/>Leon Mishnaevsky of the Technical University of Denmark suggests that wind turbine blades are generally quite reliable. These days, they are made from strong but lightweight carbon fibre composites and automated manufacturing processes help to ensure the uniform placement of the fibres, which is important for the blades' robustness, he notes.<br/>Wind turbine makers also perform a range of stress tests on blades to ensure that they are up to scratch.<br/>This can include attaching large \"exciters\" to the blades, which bounce up and down, simulating the repeated stresses of winds on the structure. Giant blades are also sometimes bent to the point of breaking, says Prof Hogg, which helps to confirm the maximum loads they can bear.<br/>But the fallibility of turbines, especially the biggest ones, is becoming more apparent as time goes by. Insurer GCube notes in a recent report that offshore wind losses rose from \u00a31m in 2012 to more than \u00a37m in 2021.<br/>Plus, machines with capacities larger than 8MW can suffer component failures within just two years of installation, the firm says, more than twice as fast as 4-8MW devices.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Some of the most dangerous forces to trouble turbine blades are torsion, or twisting, loads, says Find M\u00f8lholt Jensen, chief executive of Bladena, a firm that specialises in diagnosing and repairing large turbine blades around 60m in length, or longer. <br/>Repeated twisting of blades can induce difficult-to-spot fractures, he says: \"The damage cannot be seen from the outside.\"<br/>The longer the blade, the greater the risk, comments a spokesman for Bladena.<br/>Current testing and industry standards are not sufficient to prove that the largest turbine blades can withstand these stresses, argues Dr Jensen.<br/>New designs could help, though. In Japan, Challenergy has been working on a turbine with tall, vertical blades that spin around a central tower.<br/>While currently much smaller and less powerful than the biggest traditional, three-bladed turbines in operation today, Challenergy's device is intended to cope with very high winds. <br/>When a powerful typhoon called Hin Nam No struck the Philippines and Japan last August, it passed over two of the company's turbines. One of the devices, at Ishigaki City in Okinawa, recorded wind speeds of around 64mph. The turbine continued to operate without any problems, according to Challenergy.<br/>In the US, a research team has taken a cue from nature in their design of an alternative hurricane-resistant turbine. <br/>\"We were inspired by palm trees,\" explains Lucy Pao at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"In high winds they kind of go with the flow, they bend with the wind.\"<br/>She and her colleagues designed a prototype two-bladed wind turbine design with flexible blades. Plus, the rotor faces downwind rather than into the wind, as is common in traditional configurations, helping it to absorb the impact of strong gales.<br/>During tests at an onshore site in Colorado, the blade tips were observed deflecting by up to 600mm, more than half a metre. \"None of them snapped,\" says Prof Pao.<br/>Wind speeds in the area can reach 100mph in the wintertime, she adds.<br/>However, the wind energy industry has almost universally adopted the upwind, three-bladed design so selling a new concept is difficult, Prof Pao explains. Currently, her research in this area is on hold, pending further funding.<br/>She shares the concerns of other observers who question whether wind turbines are really ready for some of the strongest winds nature can hurl at them.<br/>\"The novel materials, they are stronger, they are pretty amazing, but I don't know that they've been tested out as thoroughly as maybe they should be,\" she says.<br/>Then there are the tricky economics of siting turbines in places where winds are especially variable. James Martin is chief executive at Gulf Wind Technology, a company exploring the deployment of turbines in the Gulf of Mexico. <br/>In this area, low wind speeds are common for most of the year - with the occasional hurricane blasting its way through. <br/>\"If you design that turbine to be strong enough to withstand the peak wind event, then you'll be carrying a lot of extra cost for the times that you've got light wind,\" notes Mr Martin. He declines to share details of the turbines or technologies his firm is considering.<br/>In the coming years, you can expect to see more and more turbines arriving in regions affected by cyclones, though.<br/>\"We need [turbines] there as much as we need them in any other area of the globe,\" argues Prof Hogg. \"I don't think we should shy away from it.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

We each have our own stick and box, and are meant to strike the box with the stick in sync with a light pattern. But of course I'm also watching the robot - and I'm aware that it's watching me.<br/>This drumming experiment has been designed to test how the presence of a robot doing the same task affects a human's behaviour.<br/>It's one of many experiments of human-robot interaction being carried out by the research group CONTACT (Cognitive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.<br/>Though I'm aware of the lights and the other people in the room, my gaze keeps being drawn to the iCub's heavy white eyelids.<br/>For one thing, there's a noticeable noise when the robot blinks every few seconds. And, because this childlike robot has expressive, oversized eyes, its gaze is compelling. <br/>This matters because with blinking, as with other aspects of eye gaze, there's more than strictly meets the eye.<br/>\"While it is often assumed that blinking is just a reflexive physiological function associated with protective functions and ocular lubrication, it also serves an important role in reciprocal interaction,\" comments Helena Kiilavuori, a psychology researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland.<br/>Human blinking conveys attention and emotion. As a means of non-verbal communication, it expresses a number of things we aren't consciously aware of, such as who should take a turn in a conversation.<br/>Thus, it's just one of many social signals humans exchange constantly without being aware of them, yet while deriving a great deal of information and comfort from them.<br/>So social roboticists have been studying both the physical and psychological properties of human blinking to understand why it might be useful to match it in robots.<br/>\"Due to the many important functions of blinking in human behaviour, it could be assumed that having robots blinking their eyes could significantly enhance their perceived human-likeness. This could, in turn, facilitate human-robot interaction,\" says Ms Kiilavuori.<br/>Put another way, \"When the robot's blinking well,\u202fpeople feel for your character,\" says David Hanson, who leads Hanson Robotics.<br/>Indeed, CONTACT research with 13-year-olds and adults in Italy shows that both groups simply like blinking robots more. An unblinking robot can give a person the unpleasant impression of being stared at, points out Alessandra Sciutti, who leads the CONTACT unit.<br/>Humans also perceive robots that blink more naturally as more intelligent. And intelligence matters in situations where humans depend on robots to provide information, such as in train stations.<br/>Despite the benefits of natural-looking blinking, integrating it into robots (apart from avatars and robots with screen displays for faces) is technically challenging.<br/>\"Blinks are one of the subtlest of human movements, so designing mechanisms that can mimic these movements require advanced technology, such as high-precision motors,\" Ms Kiilavuori explains. The roboticists at Engineered Arts, for example, use expensive, aerospace-grade motors as well as designing their own control electronics.  <br/>Specifically, says Mr Hanson of Hanson Robotics, \"The speed of the motors moving skin material when blinking is really challenging and making the shape of the eye look natural while blinking is happening is also challenging. As well as reducing friction between artificial eyelids and the eye surface itself.\"<br/>Another issue here is a trade-off between the speed and sound of motorised blinking. Francesco Rea, a senior technician at the CONTACT unit, says that in the iCub robot a quieter motor could dampen the sound of a blink. But the slower movement then makes the robot look sleepy or catlike. <br/>Very slow blinks also risk a loss of visual information, as the iCub's camera is located behind the eyes. \"In vision, missing two frames is not that big an issue,\" says Mr Rea. \"Missing ten frames starts to be an issue.\"<br/>Ms Kiilavuori adds, \"Another challenge is the correct timing and duration of blinks.\" The different functions that blinking performs - such as how a person changes blinking speed while telling a lie - involve different eyelid dynamics as well as different emotional states.<br/>\"Any deviation from the natural and appropriate blinking times and duration, in a given context, can make the robot appear odd and disturbing,\" she says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The CONTACT team use a software program that partially randomises the intervals between single and double blinking. After all, blinking fixedly wouldn't look very natural either. <br/>Over at Disney Research, roboticists have joined forces with character animators to develop a research prototype for realistic robotic gaze. The aim is to design an expressive system of eye gaze that is easy for animators to control in order to convey subtle emotion.<br/>With elements like motion curves of eyelids, \"we can kind of isolate these individual behaviours, which makes it much easier to really concentrate on getting small aspects and small details correct,\" says James Kennedy, a research scientist at Disney Research.<br/>They've patented their system of robotic sensing and control of eye gaze. This includes software for processing images taken by a camera in the robot's chest, and generating control signals for movements like opening and closing the eyelids. <br/>Mr Kennedy says that the research remains more experimental, and isn't yet being applied in Disney's theme parks. \"The goal here was to really select a single social cue that we were interested in and push it as far as we could in making lifelike believable motion and behaviour\u202fthat we felt would provide a platform for engagement with people.\" <br/>The technology would need to be refined in order, for instance, for the eye gaze system to remain believable in longer close-up interactions with humans.<br/>Another general challenge would be getting humanoid robots to begin syncing their blinking patterns to those of humans, as humans do in conversation. <br/>These types of challenges remain compelling to some roboticists. And, contrary to exaggerated pop culture depictions of androids that are indistinguishable from humans, blinking is one tiny example of the many complexities that still keep robotic interactions from seeming completely natural.  <br/>When trying to replicate a mechanism as tiny and sometimes underappreciated as blinking, \"actually you reveal how complex this mechanism is, and then how much subtle movement there is,\" notes Mr Kennedy. \"And that's where we have this really great opportunity for exploration and invention.\"\u202f <br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Or was it?<br/>Coral, who is based in Malaysia, heard of a website called TimeRepublik, which describes itself as \"a timebank for the internet era\".<br/>Time banking is in essence a more sophisticated form of bartering. You don't pay someone in money for a job that they do for you. Instead you give that person time credits that they can then use to get a service without financial payment from someone else.<br/>Via the TimeRepublik website, Coral was able to connect with Cherish Cullison, a New York-based professional wardrobe stylist and costume designer.<br/>Over Zoom, Cherish was able to help Coral find the modern clothing that best suited her.<br/>\"She styled me very well,\" says Coral. \"No money can pay for such a transaction, it is priceless, it is based on trust.\"<br/>The two have stayed in touch after they first met on TimeRepublik a few years ago. This has included Coral returning the favour of assistance, and giving Cherish some meditation lessons.<br/>Cherish says it is good that \"the expectation of money is out of the way\". <br/>\"Instead you really get to the core of things and you discover something, I think, that's greater and sort of priceless.\"<br/>TimeRepublik is the brainchild of Swiss co-founders Gabriele Donati and Karim Varini. They launched the first version in Switzerland back in 2012, but international expansion has come in the past couple of years.<br/>The website is free to use for members of the public. Users offering a service earn a \"TimeCoin\" credit. This amounts to 15 minutes no matter what job you provide, be it cutting the lawn of a neighbour, or maths tuition via a video call.<br/>You simply advertise what you are offering and how long it would take in TimeCoins. <br/>\"We wanted to distance ourselves from financial transactions and find something that could create relationships between people,\" says Mr Donati. \"Because we truly believe that only through our relationships, you can gain the trust of another person.\"<br/>TimeRepublik is today based in both Lugano, Switzerland and New York, and says it has more than 100,000 users around the world. It makes money by selling the service to companies who then offer it to their staff via their internal websites. <br/>The concept of time banking has been around since the 19th Century. Mr Donati says that he wanted to bring it to a younger, and more digitally-savvy audience.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Another organisation helping to take time banking online is charity Timebanking UK. This offers assistance and software to help communities and organisations across the UK set up their own time-banking schemes.<br/>The platforms allow users to post offers and requests, log hours and leave feedback.<br/>Timebanking UK's chief executive Sarah Bird highlights the built-in safeguarding features, such as users being able to flag any problems. \"So if something goes wrong with the local time bank, we can just jump in there and see if we can fix things,\" she says.<br/>Ms Bird also explains that while time banking does not replace professional services or government programmes, it can underpin them, and engage people who would not usually do traditional volunteering.<br/>She adds that the Department for Work and Pensions allows jobseekers to claim time-banking hours towards their time spent looking for paid employment.<br/>\"Time banking might be the first step that someone will take from long-term unemployment before they go on to maybe volunteer or on a training course, because it's a method of making that person feel more confident about themselves,\" says Ms Bird.<br/>Timebanking UK has also set up similar schemes overseas, in countries including China, Russia, India, South Korea and Thailand.<br/>At Cardiff-based Tempo Time Credits, its time-sharing model is a bit different. Instead of participants earning credits that they can redeem from someone else doing a job for them, they get credits that they can redeem at affiliated businesses, such as local gyms, cinemas, food shops and tourist attractions.<br/>Rachel Gegeshidze, chief executive of Tempo Time Credits, says its online-based system is a way of attracting and rewarding volunteers. It is used by local authorities across the UK to help develop projects aimed at key community improvements, such as addressing loneliness or tackling poverty.<br/>\"It really supports people to do new things and try new experiences... but also, we have programmes to engage tenants in their communities and to improve health and wellbeing,\" she says.<br/>The charity's 2022 Impact Report showed that there were 10,731 active participants and about 1,100 involved organisations. The study also found that 84% of people taking part felt more positive about their future.<br/>Back at TimeRepublik, it says it doesn't wish to be seen as a replacement for cash economies, and that instead it was \"built to coexist\" with them.<br/>Cherish Cullison says that from her experience \"everyone has been very happy about the exchanges and I've met some really interesting people\".<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Now they are experimenting with nets that can protect against insects.<br/>The mesh size of insect-proof nets is determined by the local conditions, including the nature of the insects.<br/>Of course that could shut out the insects that farmers really do want - pollinators like bees. <br/>One option is to apply the nets after the pollination period. Another is to open the nets during the day, while bringing in beehives.<br/>Tree nets are particularly well established in French and Italian apple orchards, where nets draped over rows of apple trees limit the movements and egg laying of codling moths. This has helped farmers to get rid of persistent pests and reduce their use of costly and environmentally damaging chemical pesticides. <br/>There are benefits to fruit lovers as well. \"When you know that you have less pesticide residues from crops that are under exclusion nets, it's good news for consumers,\" says Prof Aoun.<br/>Nets are also seen as a way of tackling the effects of climate change. Warmer conditions have seen the resurgence of some types of insects and diseases. <br/>Some regions are seeing more intense periods of drought and heavy rain and nets can help with that.<br/>For instance, depending on the location, the type of net, and the way it is used, a netting system can shield against the solar radiation that leads to heat stress and inhibits trees' photosynthesis. <br/>But the introduction of a net could mean a more humid environment around the tree - not helpful for crops prone to fungal diseases in wetter climates like the northeastern US and Canada.<br/>But some researchers are working on hydrophobic nets, where a treatment using a botanical pesticide essentially makes the nets water repellent.<br/>Photoselective (coloured) nets can also affect the penetration of light. Dark, opaque nets reduce light intensity but not light quality.<br/>Pearl-coloured nets can scatter light better so that it reaches more parts of the vegetation. Meanwhile, blue, red and yellow nets filter certain solar wavelengths and thus can stimulate specific responses in plants related to fruit quality.<br/>Fine-tuning the net usage often leads to an increase in high-calibre fruit, according to Prof Aoun. As her research in the Mediterranean has shown, trees covered by coloured shade nets can produce larger and more vividly coloured fruit.<br/>Nets are not always the answer. They may not be appropriate for smaller, more varied orchards. Nor are they necessary for all climate conditions. <br/>Also, the nets used for fruit trees are typically made of polyethylene, which isn't ideal for a world attempting to move away from plastic dependence. <br/>More technology of business:<br/>One of the companies working on non-plastic nets is Texinov, a French technical textiles firm. Texinov is researching various types of biodegradable nets, such as ones made from flax. <br/>It has already introduced a biodegradable net made out of polylactic acid (PLA), which is produced from fermented corn. Industrial composting is needed to break down this type of net, which sales manager Adrien Etienne says is about 10% more expensive than a conventional net.<br/>Mr Etienne says that the biodegradable nets are currently more popular in Europe than in North America. This may be linked to European policies intended to reduce insecticide use. \"The nets, I think, will become more and more popular because insecticides are less popular,\" Mr Etienne says, for instance among French cherry farmers. <br/>The upfront cost has been a barrier for some farmers. \"Nets are of course a little bit expensive compared to insecticides,\" Mr Etienne acknowledges. <br/>Texinov's cheapest net sells for around \u20ac0.50 (44p) per square metre for private use in France, according to Mr Etienne. This type of net lasts for only one or two seasons, although the heavy climate protection nets can last much longer. Durability depends on factors like solar exposure. \"The nets are more and more fragile because of the sun,\" says Mr Etienne.<br/>Overall, Prof Aoun says that prices are dropping as products become more varied and accessible. \"In general the positive impact of the net is overwhelming the negative side,\" she summarises.<br/>Jean-Marc Rochon heads the apple tree nursery P\u00e9pini\u00e8re Rochon in Quebec and is keeping an eye on advances in netting.<br/>\"In my eyes, this technology is more in the development and improvement phase rather than in large-scale application,\" he says. <br/>For Mr Rochon to begin using nets on his apple trees, the cost of the netting wouldn't be the only factor. \"I see it more as a way of rethinking our ways of doing things,\" he explains. <br/>To be viable for his nursery, the netting would have to be reliable and not create a work overload. It would also need to be useable on large orchard sections.<br/>Clearly, technological refinements and communication will be necessary to convince more fruit growers that netting would be useful. <br/>But Prof Aoun believes, \"As we move toward more climatic challenges and unpredictable weather, protective cultivation using nets is the way forward.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The current level is 6.17%, compared to the peak last year of 6.51%.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice.

Figures published on Tuesday show UK wages have risen at a record annual pace, fuelling fears that inflation will stay high for longer.<br/>The expectation of further increases has pushed up the cost of funding mortgages, and so lenders have been raising the rates they charge customers. <br/>At the hearing, Andrew Assam, homes director at Lloyds Banking Group, told MPs this was changing the plans of first-time buyers.<br/>\"People are either putting down a larger deposit or buying a smaller property because affordability is tighter,\" he told MPs. \"We won't lend as much now, so people are moderating what they can afford to buy.\"<br/>People coming off fixed deals and looking for a new one could potentially have to pay hundreds of pounds more a month.<br/>Around 2.4 million fixed-rate mortgages are due to end between now and the end of 2024, according to figures from banking trade association UK Finance.<br/>Aaron Strutt, from mortgage broker Trinity Financial, said that the uncertainty of the situation made it difficult for lenders to price mortgages. A rush of people trying to secure deals at lower rates had meant the money allocated by some providers to lend in mortgages was drained. <br/>He added that there was evidence of a split with large numbers of people renewing with their existing lender, without the requirement for further affordability assessments.<br/>The recent rises in mortgage costs are also likely to have a knock-on effect on renters who could face higher payments as landlords seek to recoup the rising cost of higher mortgages. Squeezed landlords may decide to sell properties, which could lead to fewer homes available to rent, according to the National Residential Landlords Association.<br/>Following a meeting with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, lenders agreed to some flexibility and making sure homes are not swiftly repossessed from those struggling to pay.<br/>Labour is also planning to hold its own mortgage summit in the coming days.<br/>Read more here<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Are you struggling to pay your mortgage?

They will also discuss providing more weapons and ammunition. <br/>On the membership issue, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky wants Nato to say Ukraine could join as soon as possible after the fighting ends - setting out explicitly how and when this could be achieved. <br/>But some Nato nations are reluctant to go too far, fearing the promise of near-automatic membership could give Russia an incentive both to escalate and drag out the war. <br/>Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, said no final decision had been made on the language of the final communiqu\u00e9, but added: \"I am absolutely certain that we will have unity and a strong message on Ukraine.\"<br/>But after late night talks on Monday, he announced that Turkey had agreed to support Sweden's application to join Nato. The news was welcomed by the US and Germany, as well as Sweden itself.<br/>Turkey had spent months blocking Stockholm's application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. Mr Stoltenberg said the two sides had worked together to address Turkey's \"legitimate security concerns\".<br/>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier suggested he would back Sweden if the EU re-opened frozen membership talks with Ankara - a request that was rejected by EU officials.<br/>Over their two-day meeting, Nato leaders are expected to agree new plans to deter and defend the alliance against future Russian aggression by beefing up their forces in the east. <br/>And they are also expected to step up their financial commitment, making the target of spending 2% of national wealth on defence a minimum figure, rather than a general ambition. Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the UK prime minister would call on allies directly to meet this target. <br/>Security is tight in Vilnius, with Nato forces - including Patriot air defence missiles - defending a summit taking place only a short distance from Belarus and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. <br/>The overarching aim of the meeting is for Nato to convince President Vladimir Putin of the alliance's long-term military commitment to Ukraine. <br/>Officials hope this could begin to change the Russian leader's thinking, putting doubt in his mind that he can outwait the West. <br/>As such, some see this summit as potentially as important as military gains on the battlefield in persuading Mr Putin to change his strategy. <br/>So some Nato members will promise Ukraine new security guarantees. US President Joe Biden has suggested Ukraine could get the kind of military support his country gives Israel - long-term commitments designed to deter potential aggressors. <br/>The alliance will also deepen its institutional links with Ukraine. An existing forum - the Ukraine Nato Commission - will be upgraded to a Ukraine Nato Council. This will give Ukraine the ability to summon meetings of the alliance as an equal partner round the table. \"The right to consult is not insignificant,\" said one official.<br/>But perhaps most importantly, some members are expected to set out more explicitly Ukraine's pathway to joining the alliance. <br/>Nato agreed at its 2008 summit in Bucharest that Ukraine \"will\" become a member and supported its application. But the alliance did not say how and when this might happen. Critics say giving Ukraine a destination but no itinerary allowed Mr Putin to risk his invasions in both 2014 and 2022. <br/>Mr Biden will meet Mr Zelensky at the summit, a US official told Reuters, although the Ukrainian president is yet to officially confirm his participation at the event.<br/>Kyiv accepts Nato cannot formally invite Ukraine to join while fighting rages. That would risk plunging the alliance into war with Russia, as Nato would be obliged under Article 5 of its treaty to defend any member that is under attack.<br/>Instead, Kyiv wants a clear promise of post-war membership with a timeline, so it knows victory will bring the security guarantee of Nato's nuclear umbrella.  <br/>One way for Nato to signal its desire to welcome Ukraine into its ranks would be to shorten the so-called membership application plan, known as the MAP. This is the formal process which tests whether a country meets Nato's strict military and governmental standards - and it can take decades. <br/>But it is what Nato might actually say about Ukraine's potential membership that is dividing the alliance. <br/>The Baltic states and eastern European nations are pushing for as much clarity as possible. They want the alliance to make clear how much progress Ukraine has made towards membership, especially how much more closely its army can operate with other Nato forces, now that it shares similar weapons and strategies. They also want Nato to make clear what further conditions Ukraine must meet to achieve membership. <br/>Gitanas Nauseda, the president of Lithuania, said Nato should avoid Ukraine's membership becoming a horizon: \"The more you walk towards it, the farther it is.\"<br/>But some allies - including the US and Germany - are cautious about promising Ukraine too much. They want Ukraine to do more to tackle corruption, strengthen its judiciary and ensure civilian control over its military. <br/>Some also worry about Nato getting dragged into open conflict with Russia. They fear promising Ukraine membership after the war would give Putin an incentive both to escalate the conflict and drag it out, maintaining low-intensity fighting to prevent Ukraine ever joining. <br/>Other allies also fear losing room for manoeuvre in any post-war negotiations. They want to use the promise of Nato membership as a carrot for Ukraine and a stick for Russia, but only after the fighting has ended. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>What is Nato and why is Sweden joining?<br/>Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' weapons?<br/>Poland strengthens Belarus border over Wagner fears<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Israel sees it antisemitic and has supported moves by other governments to outlaw such boycotts by public bodies. The issue is highly controversial, often sparking rows and protest among rival groups supportive of Israel or the Palestinians. <br/>In a sign of deep unease within the Foreign Office over the impact of the bill as drafted, a letter sent from a senior official in Mr Cleverly's office to Downing Street on 12 May warned of damaging consequences for the UK if the legislation went ahead in its current form.<br/>It suggests Moscow would use it to show the UK did not uphold the international rules-based system and was therefore \"being hypocritical in our treatment of 'annexed territory'\" in relation to Britain's condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  <br/>Foreign Office lawyers advised a clause in the bill \"would significantly increase the risk of the UK being in breach of our commitments under [United Nations Security Council Resolution] 2334.\" <br/>This appears to contradict Levelling Up Minister Felicity Buchan, who told MPs at the end of the debate on the bill: \"The government's view is that the bill is compliant with UN Security Council resolution 2334.\"<br/>A United Nations Security Council resolution, or UNSCR for short, is a formal commitment made by member states of the UN's Security Council. <br/>The council is currently chaired by the UK, and is responsible for maintaining international peace and security. <br/>The UN Security Council resolution 2334, passed in 2016, sees Israeli settlements in the occupied territories as a \"flagrant violation\" of international law and a \"major obstacle\" to peace.  It also calls on countries \"in their relevant dealings\" to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies. <br/>The Foreign Office lawyers warned that the bill could breach this commitment because it does not distinguish between boycotts against Israel and those against settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories and Golan Heights.<br/>Officials said such a breach of the resolution \"would provide ammunition to Russia in its attempt to undermine our narrative that its invasion of Ukraine is in violation of the UN charter and a number of Security Council resolutions\" and that Russia was likely to accuse the UK of being \"hypocritical\".<br/>The letter adds: \"Russia (and to an extent China, with an eye on Taiwan) would likely seize any opportunity to challenge the legitimacy of our voice on responsible multilateralism.<br/>\"In this context, the foreign secretary believes that the legislation, as drafted, will create difficult handling issues\u2026 and that Moscow will use it against us.\"<br/>It says while Mr Cleverly noted the BDS Movement is \"divisive\", the official said he recommended removing the specific references to Israel and the occupied territories from the face of the bill. <br/>It adds that the prime minister decided in December 2023 to include Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories in the bill.<br/>The bill gives the government the power to make certain countries exempt from the restrictions - meaning public bodies would be allowed to introduce their own sanctions, campaigns and boycotts against them.<br/>For example, the government intends Russia and Belarus to be exempted.<br/>Public bodies would also not be barred from complying with UK-wide sanctions. <br/>But the bill specifically singles out Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories or the Occupied Golan Heights saying they cannot be made exempt - so public bodies could not boycott them without a further law change. <br/>In doing so it groups the three together, which critics argue undermines the UK's foreign policy position by suggesting boycotting Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories or Golan Heights would be the same as boycotting Israel - despite the illegality of the former two under international law.<br/>Longstanding UK government policy calls for an end to Israel's military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories as part of a negotiated \"two-state solution\".<br/>The UK has for decades endorsed the position of international law, under which Israeli settlements are seen as illegal - although Israel disputes this - and sees their expansion as an \"obstacle to peace\".<br/>This has received criticism from some Tory MPs as well as Labour. The bill passed its first stage in the Commons last week, with two Conservative MPs voting against it.<br/>On 3 July, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Alicia Kearns, asked Michael Gove in the House of Commons if any diplomatic posts had \"specifically advised the government\" that the bill could contravene our UN security council resolutions. <br/>Mr Gove responded saying: \"I know of no such advice.\" <br/>Conservative MP William Wragg also asked him if he had read the \"write-round\" from the Foreign Office advising against this clause and asking if he had spoken to the foreign secretary about it. <br/>Mr Gove said: \"Every minister supports the bill, and quite rightly\", despite the concerns that had been raised on behalf of Mr Cleverly in the Foreign Office letter to Downing Street.<br/>In a subsequent letter to Ms Kearns, Mr Gove said: \"In line with the longstanding principle of collective agreement, the government's position was agreed by the FCDO [Foreign Office], as indeed it was by all government departments.\"<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"The Economic Activity Bill is compliant with international law and our obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 2334.<br/>\"Public bodies should not be pursuing their own foreign policy agenda and the bill will ensure that the UK speaks with one voice internationally.\"<br/>Backlash over bill banning boycotts of Israel goods<br/>Israeli military launches major operation in Jenin<br/>The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained<br/>US declares Israel boycott group BDS anti-Semitic<br/>Germany labels Israel boycott anti-Semitic<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

This will only end in further disputes that are entirely avoidable.\"<br/>Asked if the government had any plans to introduce tax cuts, Ms Atkins said: \"We do not have the headroom at the moment to look at tax cuts.  <br/>\"But as soon as we can, as soon as we have taken the measures that we are taking to reduce inflation, then we will be able to start having those conversations.\"  <br/>Appearing on the same programme, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour would \"not play fast and loose\" with the nation's finances, if it returned to power after the next general election. <br/>She said she was confident the party could meet its pledge to borrow money to fund green policies - but only if it didn't conflict with her fiscal rules. <br/>In 2021, Ms Reeves had promised to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year up to 2030, on projects such as offshore wind farms, planting trees and developing batteries.<br/>However, earlier this year she watered down the plans, saying instead that a Labour government would ramp up investment over time, aiming to reach \u00a328bn a year after 2027. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves: UK needs to get a grip on its debt<br/>Asked if she would fulfil the pledge, Ms Reeves said she was \"confident\" but added that it was subject to her limits on spending.<br/>\"Debt is now the same size as our whole economy - we've got to get a grip of that,\" she said. <br/>The shadow chancellor insisted that Labour's spending plans were \"not on the same track\" as the Conservatives, pointing to her policy to scrap the non-dom tax status as an example of how her party differed from the government. <br/>Nicola Headlam, a chief economist at Red Flag Alert, a business intelligence company, told BBC Radio Five Live that \"bearing down\" on public sector workers and not meeting the recommendations of the pay review bodies was not the answer because other people in the workforce earn more. <br/>\"If you're a public sector worker, you're paying a mortgage, you've still got to pay the prices you see in the supermarkets. <br/>\"You've got a triple impact on you - thunder, lightning and rain and there are some other people with a larger umbrella who are still stoking inflation.<br/>\"We're starting to run out of good choices and it's because of a lack of growth in the economy, because of this inflation we seem to be unable to get a handle on, because of rising interest rates.

They've had massive increases in the cost of that debt,\" he said.<br/>However, he said the committee, which would also be questioning water companies on Wednesday, wanted to know where the debt came from. <br/>Sir Robert believed the firm was taking money out in the form of debt payments, instead of dividends. \"Our suspicion is that a lot of this debt is with these very funds that own the shares,\" he said. <br/>The committee chairman said the MPs would want to know: \"Have Ofwat been asleep at the wheel or have they just not had the powers to inquire into some of the finance structures?\"<br/>Ofwat's appearance on Wednesday will be the second appearance in as many weeks in front of politicians. Last week its chief executive David Black gave evidence to the Lords' business committee when he denied the watchdog had failed to regulate the industry well.<br/>But he admitted there were \"hard lessons to learn\" and that he had been \"angered\" by excessive chief executive pay in the industry.<br/>Thames Water is not the only water company in the spotlight. The management of Southern Water is also up for scrutiny. <br/>\"It does seem rather reckless,\" Sir Robert said. \"Southern Water's credit rating has been downgraded yet again. The owners of these companies are having put to put money in yet again. My worry is the money that we're paying as water users will be going to service that debt, rather than what we want to see, which is paying to clean up our rivers and improve sewage treatment.\"<br/>However, the chair of the select committee argued a return to nationalisation was not the answer: \"I can remember when water investment was way back in the queue behind hospitals and education and to be fair, we have seen massive investment in improving our infrastructure.<br/>\"The general problem with pollution is when it rains. Many older houses have the water from their roofs going straight into the sewer, which massively overloads the system, and that's something that can be addressed with storm-water tanks. It can also be addressed by people putting in water bowsers or catching the grey water and using that to flush their toilets.\"<br/>Thames Water, which is due to publish its annual results on Monday, said it would be making no comment.<br/>In a statement to the BBC on Sunday Ofwat said: \"Thames Water need to develop a robust and credible plan to turn around the business and transform its performance for customers and the environment. For a long time, we have been pushing them to improve their financial resilience, including to cut debt. We will continue to safeguard customers' interests as they do that.\"<br/>The BBC has also approached Southern Water for comment. <br/>Water firms planning to raise bills, says regulator<br/>Thames Water needs 'substantial' sums of money<br/>Why is sewage pumped into rivers and the sea?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

For households who pay their bills by direct debit, the support was given through monthly payments from October to March.<br/>However, for those with non-conventional energy set-ups the government launched the \u00a3400 Energy Bill Support Scheme Alternative Funding earlier this year.<br/>BBC Verify analysis of data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero shows that of the more than 200,000 applications made under the scheme:<br/>Matt Cole from the charity, the Fuel Bank Foundation, said it was disappointing that so many people had missed out and believed it was down to a number of factors.<br/>\"The launch of the scheme in spring this year rather before winter when it was needed most, the reliance on families self-identifying that they were eligible rather than them automatically receiving it, and the somewhat complex process to claim help will all have contributed.\"<br/>The government said it had spent more than \u00a350m \"supporting 130,000 households without a domestic energy supplier\".<br/>This data suggests just over \u00a3300m of the possible \u00a3360m in Great Britain had not been claimed before the deadline.<br/>People who thought they were eligible needed to apply on the government website or call a helpline, which is what Mark, who lives on his narrowboat, did.<br/>\"A lot of people [on canal boats] tried to put an application through for claiming for it [but] we hit a barrier when it said: 'Do you live in a marina or are you off grid?'<br/>\"The minute you clicked 'off grid' you went through to a box that said 'you are not eligible at this time'.\"<br/>Mark uses three and a half bags of coal for his multi-fuel stove each week in winter.

That money's had to come from somewhere so it's had to come out of the rest of my budgeting or my savings.<br/>\"It would've made my winter a bit easier, maybe I could have spent a bit more money on the grandkids.\"<br/>A government spokesperson said: \"We spent billions to protect families when prices rose over winter, covering nearly half a typical household's energy bill.<br/>\"We're now seeing costs fall even further with wholesale energy prices down by over two thirds since their peak.<br/>\"We are urging councils to process applications and complete final checks as quickly as possible to ensure all those eligible receive the support they need.\"<br/>The government said anyone who did not apply before the deadline should visit its Help for Households page.<br/>Carol lives on a park home site south east of Runcorn. She says the application process was simple, but she was forced to apply three or four times because she kept getting rejected.<br/>\"We got refused, I don't know how many times. I kept going, I wouldn't give up. Because I thought, 'Why should I give up?' I've worked all my life, I've paid into the system.<br/>\"[The \u00a3400] was very important because 99.9% of people on these sites are all retired and a lot of them only have a basic pension, or maybe a bit of a top-up pension.<br/>\"But it's not going very far because food's gone up, petrol's gone up, so the \u00a3400 was absolutely a godsend.\"<br/>Park homes were the largest single group seeking the \u00a3400 support, with 47,400 households out of the 203,580 who applied.<br/>Tenants in private accommodation had the highest rejection and cancellation rates, with 47% of applications from this group being stopped. Applications were rejected if people had already received support, made a duplicate application or were not eligible.<br/>The Office for National Statistics estimated that about 137,000 care home residents in England pay for some or all of their care, and these were eligible to apply for the support.<br/>There were just under 22,000 applications from households in care homes across Great Britain.<br/>In a similar scheme for Northern Ireland, 28,000 households were eligible for \u00a3600 worth of support, totalling around \u00a316.8m.<br/>There were just over 8,000 applications in Northern Ireland from those without a domestic electricity supply, with just over 4,000 already paid by 1 June 2023 and 160 awaiting payment.<br/>Of the rest, just over 2,700 were cancelled or rejected and just over 1,000 were still being worked on.

This means they can explode at a later date, killing or injuring people.<br/>Neither the US, Ukraine or Russia are signatories of the international treaty - the Convention on Cluster Munitions - banning the use or stockpiling of them over the indiscriminate damage they can inflict on civilian populations.<br/>Speaking to reporters in Selby, Yorkshire, on Saturday, Mr Sunak said the UK is \"signatory to a convention which prohibits the production or use of cluster munitions and discourages their use\".<br/>\"We will continue to do our part to support Ukraine against Russia's illegal and unprovoked invasion, but we've done that by providing heavy battle tanks and most recently long-range weapons, and hopefully all countries can continue to support Ukraine,\" he added.<br/>\"Russia's act of barbarism is causing untold suffering to millions of people.\"<br/>Mr Sunak is due to meet with Mr Biden in London on Monday, ahead of a Nato summit in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Tuesday.<br/>Rishi Sunak spoke carefully when asked for his response to the US now giving cluster munition to Ukraine. <br/>He didn't criticise the US's decision but did point out that the Convention discourages use of the bombs. <br/>The UK is the second largest provider of military assistance to Ukraine - only behind the US. <br/>As the conflict in Ukraine evolves, so too are the responses of Kyiv's allies - on this issue the US and UK have gone in different directions. <br/>Mr Biden justified supplying the weapons by saying the \"Ukrainians are running out of ammunition\". <br/>Speaking to CNN in an interview due to air on Sunday, he said it had taken \"a while to be convinced\" to make the \"very difficult decision\" to send them.<br/>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has hailed the \"timely\" move to deliver the bombs.<br/>Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said his troops would not use them in urban areas to avoid risking civilian lives, adding \"these are our people, they are Ukrainians we have a duty to protect\".<br/>But Spanish Defence Minister Margarita Robles has said her government's position is that cluster bombs should not be used for the \"legitimate defence of Ukraine\".<br/>Germany, which has also signed the convention, said it would not provide them to Ukraine but that it understands the American position.<br/>In a statement, the Canadian government said it does not support the use of the weapons and emphasised its commitment to \"putting an end to the effects cluster munitions have on civilians - particularly children\".<br/>Human Rights Watch said both sides had used the weapons in the war, causing \"numerous deaths and serious injuries to civilians\".<br/>These comments were echoed by Amnesty International, who said cluster munitions pose \"a grave threat to civilian lives, even long after the conflict has ended\".<br/>The UN human rights office has also been critical, calling for their use to \"stop immediately\". <br/>Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said the military alliance takes no position on cluster munitions.<br/>Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the UK's defence select committee, urged the US to \"reconsider\" its decision - which he said was the \"wrong call and will alienate international goodwill\".<br/>\"Their use leaves deadly unexploded ordnance over the battlefield, killing and injuring civilians long after the war is over,\" the Conservative MP added. <br/>Russia described the US decision as an \"act of desperation\" in the face of the \"failure of the much-touted Ukrainian counteroffensive\".<br/>US allies troubled by cluster bombs to Ukraine<br/>Biden defends sending cluster bombs to Ukraine<br/>Why is US giving Ukraine 'abhorrent' weapons?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

We calculate there would need to be 3% on average [extra] funding for schools in order to do that.\"<br/>Asked whether she feared the government could overrule the pay review body, Dr Bousted said: \"Unfortunately I think that's entirely possible. We hope that that's not the case.\"<br/>The NEU is balloting for further strike action in the autumn, which could involve co-ordinated strikes with three other education unions.<br/>Dr Bousted said autumn strike action would not happen if a fully-funded 6.5% rise was offered, saying it was \"in the government's hands\".<br/>Most state school teachers in England had a 5% pay rise for the year 2022-23. <br/>The NEU wants teachers to have an above-inflation pay increase, plus extra money to ensure any pay rises do not come from schools' existing budgets. <br/>After intensive talks, the government offered an additional one-off payment of \u00a31,000. It also offered a rise for most teachers next year of 4.3%, with starting salaries reaching \u00a330,000. <br/>The Department for Education described it as a \"fair and reasonable offer\", and said schools would receive an extra \u00a32.3bn over the next two years.<br/>All four unions involved in the dispute rejected the offer. <br/>Almost 40,000 full-time working-age teachers left the profession last year - the highest level since records began in 2010 - according to government data released last month.<br/>However, overall the number of teachers has increased by 2,800 to 468,400, because more teachers have entered the profession.<br/>Are you a teacher with a view on the strike?

He said London needed a \"proper car scrappage scheme\" and more investment in public transport. <br/>The Green Party, whose candidate in Uxbridge is Sarah Green, supports the ULEZ expansion. A full list of Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election candidates can be found here.<br/>In his latest weekly column for the Daily Mail, Mr Johnson fired a broadside at the ULEZ expansion, calling it the \"Labour mayor's driving tax\" and condemning the scheme's \"sheer bone-headed cruelty\". <br/>If not even the Labour leader would wholeheartedly back it, the former prime minister said, then it was \"doomed\". <br/>Pressed on the issue during a radio phone-in, Sir Keir said Mr Beales was right to stick up for his area, but insisted the ULEZ expansion had to go ahead.<br/>He admitted it would cost motorists \"lot of money\" but said the government should add to the \u00a3110m provided by the mayor to help people replace their vehicles, as they had done in other areas with clean air zones. <br/>\"The government has given money to Portsmouth, Bristol and Birmingham to help - they haven't given a penny to London.<br/>\"I would use this opportunity to call on the government to make more money available in London.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Differing ULEZ views \"need to be accommodated,\" says Sir Keir Starmer<br/>The ULEZ was introduced in central London in 2019, developing a previous low emission zone (LEZ) for larger vehicles like buses, lorries and coaches that was first introduced in 2008.<br/>In 2021, it was extended to the North and South Circular roads, and from 29 August it will be further expanded to include the whole of Greater London.<br/>If it goes ahead, the expansion will see drivers in outer London pay a \u00a312.50 daily fee if their vehicles do not meet required emissions standards.<br/>The mayor's office have established a \u00a3110m scrappage scheme to help eligible people and businesses replace or retrofit their vehicles in order to comply with the standards. <br/>At the beginning of the year, Mr Khan wrote to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak asking him to \"help double the size\" of the scrappage scheme. <br/>The ULEZ expansion is currently facing a legal challenge, brought by five Conservative-led councils who argue Mr Khan does not have the legal powers to implement it. <br/>ULEZ expansion: Contested claims examined<br/>Why are councils taking London's mayor to court?<br/>Impact of mayor\u2019s ULEZ expansion questioned<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

In March, it extended the ban to unregulated placements for 16 and 17-year-olds. <br/>But many local authorities have continued to place children in unregulated accommodation.<br/>\"The reality is that hundreds of highly vulnerable children and young people will have nowhere to go,\" said a spokesperson for the Children's Homes Association, in a statement. <br/>It said a workforce crisis and a rise in numbers of children coming into care - with a significant increase in those facing sexual and criminal exploitation - meant there would be a shortfall in regulated placements. <br/>\"We face an unprecedented crisis in residential childcare without urgent action to address workforce challenges,\" the spokesperson added. <br/>In recent years, many local authorities have resorted to applying for court orders to restrict children's liberty as a solution to managing the risks they are facing, according to the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory. <br/>Such Deprivation of Liberty (DoL) orders can permit children to be kept under constant supervision behind locked doors and windows - in homes that need to be tailored to the risks they are considered to face. <br/>The Children's Homes Association estimates that at least 800 children on DoL orders will have to be re-homed from October. It says it is these children - which it describes as the most vulnerable in the care system - who face the most acute shortage of regulated placements. <br/>Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association's Children and Young People Board, said: \"We have long raised concerns over the availability of homes for children in care and it is vital government works with us to address these. <br/>\"The need for children's home accommodation currently outstrips supply, and this is undoubtedly driving the increasing use of unregulated and unregistered accommodation.\"<br/>A Department for Education spokesperson said it was the responsibility of local authorities to provide safe placements. <br/>\"Local authorities are responsible for providing safe, appropriate homes for children, and are held to account for the quality of care they provide.  <br/>\"We are investing over \u00a3142m over three years to make sure the transition to Ofsted registration is successful.\"<br/>Youth cuts create void for drugs gangs, MPs hear<br/>\u2018Abuse, assault, profit\u2019 - childcare staff speak out<br/>Children in care are being placed in caravans<br/>\u2018We tried 225 children\u2019s homes, none would take her\u2019<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Now he, in that instance, looked about as shocked as I did, and clearly instantly regretted what he'd done.<br/>\"But other incidents, where colleagues have put their hands on my thigh and told me at great length, how their wives don't understand them. It's just horrific.\"<br/>She said there were people she would not get in a lift with and female MPs would \"provide information to each other on who to trust, who not to trust, who we think is a little bit creepy\".<br/>Despite the increasing number of women in the Commons, there was still a \"really laddish culture where the 'banter' defence is used - 'oh well, she just can't take a bit of banter'\".<br/>\"It's just not acceptable in the 21st century workplace,\" she said. <br/>She called for a new code of conduct to be \"absolutely explicit\" in spelling out that touching colleagues or watching pornography in Parliament was unacceptable, urging whips in all parties to work together on new rules.<br/>\"There can't be any grey areas, and it has to apply equally to members of the House of Lords,\" she said.<br/>On Thursday, the Commons standards committee found that former Tory MP Chris Pincher, who now sits as an independent, should be suspended from the Commons for eight weeks for drunkenly groping two men. <br/>Mr Pincher's conduct at the private members' Carlton Club in London was \"profoundly damaging\" and \"especially grave\" because it amounted to an abuse of power and was an \"egregious case of sexual misconduct\", the committee said. <br/>Downing Street said it was a matter for Mr Pincher whether he should resign as MP for Tamworth, which would trigger a by-election. A by-election could also result if MPs approve the committee's report. <br/>The prime minister has been absent for Commons votes on other disciplinary matters, including the Privileges Committee report that found that Boris Johnson had deliberately misled Parliament. <br/>Ms Nokes said he should show support for the standards committee's findings in the Pincher case.<br/>She hoped a vote would not be needed, with MPs endorsing the report without dissent, but Mr Sunak had \"a role to play in accepting the recommendations\".<br/>Pushed on whether Mr Sunak should be in the Commons when Mr Pincher's case was considered, she said: \"I think the prime minister could do that for us.<br/>\"I think that would be a really strong signal that he's not going to tolerate it, and that would send a message to the chief [whip]: get this sorted.\"<br/>Earlier this week, five current and one former parliamentary staff members told Newsnight that inappropriate flirting and touching was common, with older MPs and staffers sometimes targeting younger women.<br/>On Tuesday, Mhairi Black, the SNP's deputy leader at Westminster, announced she was stepping down as an MP at the next general election, describing Westminster as an \"outdated, sexist and toxic\" working environment.<br/>She blamed safety concerns, social media abuse and unsociable hours.  <br/>MP Pincher faces 8-week ban over groping incident<br/>Westminster culture still 'predatory', say staff<br/>MPs' misconduct cases need proper HR - ex-whips<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It may also decide against making them public at all.<br/>Responding to the court's verdict, Deborah Doyle, a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK group, said: \"This judicial review was a desperate waste of time and money.<br/>\"A successful inquiry could save thousands of lives in the event of another pandemic, and it's a disgrace that the Cabinet Office is trying to obstruct it.\" <br/>Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner accused Rishi Sunak of \"wasting time and taxpayers' money on doomed legal battles\".  <br/>Earlier this year the Covid Inquiry - set up by the government to examine decision-making during the pandemic - requested to see WhatsApp messages on Mr Johnson's devices from a group chat set up to discuss the pandemic response. <br/>It also asked to see messages from other politicians including current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.<br/>The request triggered a row between the inquiry and the government, but also Mr Johnson.<br/>The former prime minister said he was \"more than happy\" for the inquiry to see his unredacted messages and threatened to send what material he had directly to the inquiry, by-passing the Cabinet Office. <br/>At a hearing of the case last month, government lawyer Sir James Eadie KC said the Cabinet Office had challenged the inquiry's request with \"considerable reluctance\". <br/>He argued that the government had a \"real concern\" about people's privacy and notes that some of the material included messages of a personal nature. <br/>In a confidential submission to the court, the Cabinet Office also flagged \"messages about border incursions by one foreign state into the territory of another foreign state\", as well as \"the trial of foreign nationals in the courts of another foreign state\".<br/>Representing the inquiry, Hugo Keith KC said letting the Cabinet Office decide which measures were relevant amounted to the government \"marking its own homework\".

I don't think we can dispute that.<br/>\"Our current drug law does not stop people from using drugs, it does not stop people from experiencing the harm associated and, critically, it does not stop people from dying.<br/>\"In fact, I would say today here, that criminalisation increases the harms people experience. Criminalisation kills.\"<br/>The call comes four years after the SNP backed decriminalising the possession and consumption of drugs at its party conference. <br/>A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Illegal drugs destroy lives and devastate communities. We are committed to preventing drug use by supporting people through treatment and recovery and tackling the supply of illegal drugs, as set out in our 10-year drugs strategy. \"We have no plans to decriminalise drugs given the associated harms, including the risks posed by organised criminals, who will use any opportunity to operate an exploitative and violent business model.\"<br/>The number of people who died of drug misuse in Scotland dropped slightly last year from 1,339 to 1,330 after eight consecutive years of increases, but the country continues to have by far the highest drug death rate recorded by any country in Europe.<br/>The crisis prompted more than \u00a3250m of investment by the Scottish government into the country's addiction services.<br/>Efforts to establish drug consumption rooms in Scotland have been ongoing for years. <br/>Campaigners say the facilities - where people can inject drugs under supervision - are needed and are backed by the Scottish government.<br/>However, an attempt to set up consumption rooms in Glasgow was blocked by UK government, which argued a range of crimes would be committed in the course of running such facilities.<br/>In 2021, a decision by the Lord Advocate meant people caught with Class A drugs in Scotland could be given a police warning instead of facing prosecution.<br/>Critics at the time said the move, which does not extend to drug dealing, was \"de facto decriminalisation\".<br/>Scottish Conservative justice spokesman Russell Findlay added: \"It is madness to try and solve Scotland's drug death crisis, the worst in Europe, by essentially legalising heroin, crack and other class-A drugs.<br/>\"This would put more drugs on our streets. It would put more lives at risk. \"<br/>The shift was also ruled out by UK Labour with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves telling journalists during a visit to Scotland:  \"I don't think this sounds like a good policy.\"<br/>A joint statement from 10 leading drugs charities welcomed the Scottish government's report, but said drug consumption rooms and drug testing facilities \"as a matter of urgency\".<br/>It's the first week of the Scottish Parliament recess.  It's a Friday.  It's the junior minister.<br/>An unusual way to launch a major policy change on drugs.<br/>The decriminalisation of personal drug possession is designed, as the minister says, to save lives.<br/>The Lord Advocate has already said there's a presumption against prosecution for personal drug possession - but that's only a presumption.<br/>This new policy draws a thick red line under that. <br/>Couple decriminalisation with drug treatment rooms and Scotland could have a very new approach to tackling a huge problem.<br/>We have more than three times the deaths from drugs overdoses than any European country. <br/>The Scottish government calls these plans ambitious and radical.<br/>Perhaps hard to argue with that.  This is a significant proposal - but is it one to take seriously, given the circumstances of the launch?<br/>Yes, say the government's partners the Scottish Green Party - and also the Scottish Liberal Democrats.<br/>Scottish Labour don't think it's the right approach.  One of the party's MSPs has consulted though on a potential bill for Overdose Prevention Centres.<br/>Labour add that communities blighted by drugs are often over-looked in the debate. <br/>The Scottish Conservatives think it's \"madness\" and Downing Street has already said \"no\".<br/>Both Conservatives and Labour claim this is another, cooked-up constitutional grievance from the SNP.<br/>So, once again more constitutional arguments - but some argue there's no time left for that. <br/>Warnings instead of prosecution for Class A drugs<br/>SNP formally backs decriminalisation of drugs<br/>Could drug consumption rooms become legal in Scotland?<br/>Rising drug deaths not due to ageing users - report<br/>Drugs death chief says punishing addicts must stop<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

under which there will be a by-election in his Tamworth seat if 10% of registered voters sign a petition calling for one.<br/>A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Mr Pincher was no longer a member of the government, and any sanction was up to MPs to decide.<br/>Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain called on Mr Sunak to confirm he would personally vote to endorse a suspension. <br/>\"Sunak promised to govern with integrity, he must vote with it,\" she added.<br/>Mr Pincher was elected as a Conservative MP, but was suspended from representing the party in Parliament last year after the allegations emerged.<br/>Following reports about his conduct at the club, Mr Pincher apologised for \"drinking far too much\" and embarrassing \"himself and other people\".<br/>Boris Johnson's handling of the allegations led to the downfall of his government, after a wave of ministers resigned.<br/>After the allegations emerged, ministers insisted the former prime minister was not aware of specific allegations against Mr Pincher when he appointed him to the deputy chief whip role.<br/>The BBC later reported that Mr Johnson was made aware of a formal complaint about Mr Pincher's \"inappropriate behaviour\" while he was a Foreign Office minister from 2019-20.<br/>Dozens of ministers submitted their resignations in the wake of the controversy, prompting Mr Johnson, who was already under pressure over the Partygate scandal, to resign as prime minister.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' -

This could range from \u00a3300m to \u00a31.5bn, the DWP has said.<br/>Its central estimate is that \u00a31bn is owed, to about 210,000 people, of which 43,000 have died.

But the UK research community has constantly and unanimously argued for membership of the European Horizon programme. <br/>If Mr Sunak rejects the options on his desk, the anger from the scientific establishment will be ''unimaginable\", according to a senior scientific leader.<br/>Should events go as expected, the deal will come as a huge relief to the scientific community. Many of the UK's leading researchers have been left in limbo over the future of their world-leading research projects and in some cases their own jobs and those of their teams.<br/>Associate membership had been agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement when the UK formally left the EU at the end of January 2020. But the arrangement was not activated because of a disagreement over the Northern Ireland protocol. This was resolved in February of this year and it had been hoped that a deal for Horizon would swiftly follow.<br/>The EU waived the UK's joining fee for the time it had not been a member, but it stuck to the arrangement agreed with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government about the funding the UK would be expected to receive. <br/>The government had agreed that if UK researchers received less than 12% of what the UK put in, Britain could terminate the arrangement. The figure for other associate members of Horizon is 8%, but it was thought to be a price worth paying for continuing to be part of the programme by the government at the time.<br/>Talks since the Windsor agreement have focussed largely on renegotiating this figure to be more in line with that of other associate members. It is understood that two formulae have now been agreed between the UK and EU, which await the prime minister's signature.<br/>The stand-off has bemused UK researchers because pre-Brexit the UK received around \u00a3500m more than the \u00a31.5bn a year it put in. For Horizon the government has agreed to pay approximately \u00a32bn a year and given the quality of British science, the research community believes it would get at least the same amount back. Many feel that months have been lost haggling over a hypothetical point.<br/>News that a draft agreement had been reached was reported on Wednesday afternoon by Politico, but was greeted by a terse statement from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. <br/>\"Talks are ongoing and, therefore, we have not yet agreed a deal.\"<br/>On Thursday morning Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said the Prime Minister was keen to seek \"value for money for taxpayers\" if the UK is to rejoin the scheme, with \"constructive\" discussions still going on.<br/>''I think overall we want to make sure that any deal, whether it is Horizon or the UK alternative Pioneer, is the one that produces the best value for UK science and research and also for taxpayers. That is what the Prime Minister will consider at the appropriate time.\" <br/>James Wilsdon, a professor of science policy at University College London, told BBC News what while this was \"wonderful news\" the uncertainty over the past three years had \"blighted\" UK-EU scientific collaboration.<br/>\"In haggling over the budget, the UK was in danger of being penny wise but pound foolish \u2014 emphasising short-term costs over the huge long-term gains that will flow from UK participation. <br/>\"Hopefully, a compromise has now been reached and the research community can move forward with the clarity and commitment that it has been crying out for.\"<br/>Professor Lord Krebs, a long-serving and respected scientific adviser to the government from the University of Oxford, said: \"Delays over two years have caused serious and lasting damage to UK R&D.\" <br/>Nobel prize winner Sir Paul Nurse said the prime minister should finalise the deal \"without further delay\", a view echoed by Prof Sarah Main, executive director of Campaign for Science and Engineering.<br/>\"I urge the prime minister and president of the European Commission to secure this agreement, enabling researchers to get on with the vital role they play in improving people's lives and livelihoods,\" she said. <br/>Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, also urged the prime minister to finalise the deal, saying there were a lot of people in Europe \"with their fingers and toes crossed that it gets across the line\". <br/>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said that among the benefits of joining the programme were greater opportunities for research collaboration - as well as access to larger grants for UK universities. <br/>The UK is also seeking to rejoin the Copernicus Earth observation programme.<br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Scientists warn Sunak on EU research programme<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

There will be a further day of debate in the Lords before it returns to the Commons. <br/>One amendment would make it a legal duty for ministers to create safe and legal routes to the UK for refugees by next spring. Two others reinstate and expand a right of appeal against age assessments for migrants claiming to be children.<br/>Ahead of Wednesday's debate, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York urged ministers to back changes to the legislation to ensure a \"just\" and \"compassionate\" asylum policy.<br/>In a letter to The Times signed by eight other faith leaders, the two archbishops warned the legislation \"falls short of our obligation to the most vulnerable\".<br/>The prime minister's official spokesman said he was not going to respond to individual opinions.<br/>But, he added, Mr Sunak was \"clear that stopping the boats, stopping the cruel cycle of vulnerable people being exploited by criminal gangs, is the fair and compassionate thing to do\". <br/>If passed, the bill would place a legal duty on the government to detain and remove migrants arriving in the UK illegally, either to Rwanda or another \"safe\" third country.<br/>The government has stressed it remains committed to its plan to remove migrants to Rwanda, and has said it will challenge a Court of Appeal ruling last week that this was unlawful.<br/>On Tuesday, Mr Sunak told the Liaison Committee of senior MPs the government's case would be made in the Supreme Court \"confidently and vigorously\".<br/>In the first six months of 2023, 11,434 people were detected making the journey from France, according to provisional Home Office figures.<br/>The June total of 3,824 was the highest since records began in 2018. In June last year, 3,140 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel.<br/>Despite the record June number, the total for the first half of the year was 10% lower than for January-June 2022 (12,747).<br/>In January, Mr Sunak set out five pledges which he said would address \"the people's priorities\", including passing new laws to stop Channel crossings. But he did not put a timescale on achieving the promise. <br/>Last month, he insisted his plan was \"starting to work\".<br/>Labour has accused the prime minister of chasing \"short-term headlines instead of doing the hard work needed to tackle the problem\".<br/>Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The numbers of dangerous crossings are rising again, hotel costs are spiralling, all while the government's flagship Rwanda policy unravels in front of their eyes.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Lords vote to keep child migrant detention limits<br/>Government defeated in Lords over small boats bill<br/>Is Sunak keeping his five key promises?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Earlier this week, their Uxbridge candidate Blaise Baquiche criticised the generosity of scrappage scheme for low-income Londoners with grants to replace polluting vehicles.<br/>The Green Party, whose candidate in Uxbridge is Sarah Green, supports the ULEZ expansion. A full list of Uxbridge and South Ruislip by-election candidates can be found here.<br/>At an election hustings earlier this week, Mr Beales said it was \"not the right time\" to expand ULEZ, amid current cost of living pressures. <br/>Pressed on whether he agreed with his by-election candidate, Sir Keir replied: \"I completely understand his position,\" adding: \"He's fighting for what he hopes will be his constituents in that by-election if he wins it\".<br/>But he added that Mr Khan had made the decision to expand the zone in the \"context\" of a legal requirement to reduce air pollution.<br/>\"So reducing this to a political argument for the sake of the by-election, without regard to the background, doesn't make any difference,\" he said.<br/>He added that he wanted central government to give more support for people and businesses affected by the expansion.<br/>Speaking earlier in the London Assembly, Mr Khan confirmed Mr Beales had lobbied him for a delay to the scheme, as well as more support for residents. <br/>\"Danny's got a different view to me and I respect him. He's a local champion, he's a fighter,\" the mayor added.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has repeatedly spoken out against ULEZ expansion, telling MPs last month that Mr Khan was \"not listening\" to the views of residents in outer London.<br/>Five Conservative-led councils have launched a legal challenge to the expansion, with their lawyers arguing in the High Court this week that Mr Khan lacks the legal powers to do so.<br/>The Conservatives recently cited a proposed congestion charge in Cambridge for winning theirfirst seat on the city council since 2012.<br/>Lib Dem MP tables motion to delay ULEZ expansion<br/>Labour MPs call for ULEZ scrappage scheme review<br/>Could the Conservatives lose five by-elections?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

has urged the watchdog, Ofcom, to decide whether politicians should be allowed to present TV programmes on news channels.<br/>Chris Banatvala said no-one foresaw the rise of politician presenters when the rules were being designed in the 2000s.<br/>He said Ofcom should take \"a view about whether what is emerging is acceptable in terms of due impartiality\".<br/>The regulator is reviewing its rules around politicians presenting TV shows.<br/>Under Ofcom's rules, news must be presented with due impartiality, and politicians are not allowed to be newsreaders, interviewers or reporters \"unless, exceptionally, it is editorially justified\".<br/>Ofcom says there are no rules against politicians hosting current affairs programmes, as long as they reflect a range of views.<br/>But there's been a debate about how these rules apply to the growing number of programmes fronted by politicians on GB News and Talk TV, both relatively new channels.<br/>Last month, Ofcom commissioned research into these programmes after receiving hundreds of complaints about politicians presenting shows.<br/>Then this week, the regulator launched two investigations into potential rule breaches on two programmes, including the GB News show presented by the former cabinet minister, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg.<br/>In the episode in question, Sir Jacob read out a breaking story about the jury verdict in a civil case involving the former US president, Donald Trump.<br/>Writing in the Telegraph this week, Ofcom's chief executive, Melanie Dawes, said the regulator had a \"crucial role in preserving the integrity of broadcast news\" and a duty to \"ensure our rules remain effective\".<br/>Mr Banatvala was Ofcom's director of standards when the regulator's rules around politicians presenting programmes were introduced in 2005.<br/>He told the BBC that in a changing media landscape, we need \"a grown-up debate about whether and how we want to apply due impartiality to news\".<br/>\"It's evident now that news channels are blurring the boundaries between genuine news, current affairs and opinion,\" he said. \"That may be a good reason for Ofcom to look at these rules in the round.\"<br/>He added: \"We may need to look at whether these rules are fit for purpose, and whether we need to amend or adjust them.\"<br/>He said the tenor of programme on some channels in the UK \"is something that's come across the pond from America\".<br/>It's long been common to see politicians hosting programmes that veer between partisan commentary and news coverage on channels such as Fox News in the US.<br/>The UK's impartiality rules go back decades and were included in Ofcom's broadcasting code following its creation as the communications regulator in 2003.<br/>If broadcasters are found to have breached the code, Ofcom has powers to impose fines and other sanctions.<br/>When the impartiality rules were drafted, Mr Banatvala said, they were felt to be \"ample and adequate to prevent any programme from using the same political party over and over again\".<br/>\"It wasn't ever envisaged that a news channel would use politicians from the same political party to present programmes, day in, day out,\" he said.<br/>Grilling two Ofcom directors at a meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in Parliament on Tuesday, SNP MP John Nicolson asked why the regulator was not taking more action over programmes fronted by sitting politicians.<br/>Singling out Mr Rees-Mogg's programme on GB News, Mr Nicolson said \"every day, he churns out the same pro-Brexit, right-wing stuff\", arguing \"what he's doing is blurring news presenting and commentary\".<br/>He asked: \"Why don't you act to stop this?\"<br/>Kate Davies, Ofcom's public policy director, said the watchdog looks at current affairs programmes \"differently\" to those focused solely on news.<br/>Following further frank exchanges, Mr Nicolson said \"we've lost all sight of objective journalism\" and suggested \"we're going to proceed down a route where we end up with awful, American-style ranting at the camera, we're already seeing it, masquerading as news\".<br/>Kate Biggs, Ofcom's content policy director, said the media watchdog takes its responsibility on impartiality and accuracy rules \"very seriously\".<br/>She said the regulator's investigations into programmes \"do set a precedent for other editors\".<br/>TalkTV said it \"will engage with the Ofcom process and looks forward to defending its output.\"<br/>GB News has also been contacted for comment.<br/>Sign up for our

We are going far beyond other countries and delivering tangible progress whilst bringing down energy bills with hundreds of pounds coming off bills.<br/>\"With a new department dedicated to delivering net zero and energy security, we are driving economic growth, creating jobs, bringing down energy bills, and reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels.<br/>\"The UK is also cutting emissions faster than any other G7 country and attracting billions of investment into renewables, which now account for 40% of our electricity.\"<br/>Mr Skidmore is one of the Conservative party's keenest advocates for pursuing net-zero policies - plans that ensure the UK is not adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. <br/>Last year, he was commissioned by then-Prime Minister Liz Truss to review the government's delivery of net zero to ensure it was \"pro-growth and pro-business\".<br/>Mr Skidmore, who is standing down as an MP at the next general election, told the Institute for Government event that having voted against the government on fracking In October, he had been \"fully prepared to be sacked\" from his climate role. <br/>However, the following day Ms Truss resigned, \"and I was left in post,\" he said. <br/>Addressing the same conference, Labour's shadow energy secretary Ed Miliband said climate change was a \"great threat\" but also provided a \"great opportunity\".<br/>He argued that changing the UK's sources of energy would ensure the country was not \"at the mercies of the Putins of this world\". The UK has been trying to decrease its reliance on Russian oil and gas since the invasion of Ukraine last year. <br/>Last month, Labour watered down its pledge to invest \u00a328bn a year in green industries.

Others on the left have been successful.<br/>And Neal Lawson, director of campaign group Compass and a stalwart of the soft left, recently said he is facing an official investigation over some old tweets calling for cross-party co-operation. <br/>The party says it is looking into his support for other political parties, which is a breach of Labour rules.<br/>In a statement, a spokesperson told the BBC said it had \"high standards\" for prospective election candidates, and this was \"absolutely right\".<br/>\"This is a changed Labour Party back in the service of working people so we can build a better Britain,\" they added.<br/>In his Newsnight interview, Mr McDonnell said: \"I've written to Keir a few times saying: Look, this factionalism is causing us real problems for the future\u2026There is a sort of a right-wing faction that have got into fairly senior positions and they seem be waging some form of purge against the left.<br/>\"And what I said to Keir, is we've always been a broad church. This doesn't help the party, and we're always successful when we're a broad church. <br/>\"Previous leaders and prime ministers of the Labour Party have always had in their cabinet a broad church approach - left, right and centre. They've tolerated different views within the party. <br/>\"In fact, many of them have welcomed it because you get better discussion, better debates and you get a better decision policy making as well.<br/>\"And I said: there's a faction here that actually are so intolerant of dissent that they're removing people, it will weaken our party. And I also said to him, if you stumble, these are the people that will come for you.\"<br/>Mr McDonnell, a close ally of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, has also raised concerns with Sir Keir over former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott's suspension as a Labour MP.<br/>The Labour whip was withdrawn from the veteran left-winger in April, pending an investigation into a letter she wrote about racism to the Observer.<br/>In the letter, she said \"many types of white people with points of difference\" can experience prejudice, but they were not subject to racism \"all their lives\". She later withdrew her remarks and apologised \"for any anguish caused\".<br/>Mr McDonnell said her comments had been \"wrong\", but added that he had given Sir Keir \"several examples of MPs where they've made similar mistakes, some of them worse,\" and had the party whip restored. <br/>\"Why are we discriminating against the first black woman in Parliament? Is it because she is on the left? And there's too many examples like that have taken place,\" he added.<br/>The former shadow chancellor said he had advised the Labour leader to ask barrister Martin Forde KC, who was commissioned by Sir Keir in 2020 to examine allegations of bullying, racism and sexism, to re-examine \"factionalism\" within the party.<br/>He added that he should also be consulted on \"some of these issues about the individual cases and complaints that have been made\".<br/>\"In that way, we might be able to restore confidence in the whole process within the party [around] selections and disciplinary process.\"<br/>The former shadow chancellor also said that former PM Tony Blair, who is reviled by many on the left, had tolerated different views when he was prime minister. <br/>Mr McDonnell said: \"If you look at [it] under Tony Blair, we didn't have mass expulsions like this or anything like that. We didn't have the withdrawal of the whip unless it was something very extreme. There was an atmosphere of tolerance, but actually respect as well.\"<br/>Josh Simons, director of the Labour Together think tank that is supportive of Sir Keir's leadership, denied there was a purge of the Labour left. <br/>He told Newsnight that Sir Keir was building a party \"capable and equipped to govern this country and transform it,\" including getting people \"with talent, with energy, with vigour and commitment into Parliament to do that\".<br/>He also added that the Labour leader was implementing recommendations from the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, which published a review in 2020 into how the party handled complaints of antisemitism within the party.<br/>\"And if there are people who have tweeted things, shared things on Facebook, engaged with posts that fall foul of those EHRC recommendations, then those people are and should be blocked from being part of the Labour party's leadership in the future,\" he added.<br/>You can watch BBC Newsnight's interview in full on Tuesday 4 July from 22.30 BST on BBC Two.<br/>Labour left-wing angry about candidates' blocking<br/>Labour mayor barred from party's NE mayoral list<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

All the allegations they made relate to the last two years.<br/>Ellie Varley, 25, said everyone who works in Parliament either has their own story of sexual misconduct, or knows someone with one. She said the problem \"transcends party politics\".<br/>She says she was asked to sit on a male MP's lap, in an incident that took place on the Parliamentary estate. \"He just kept saying just come sit on my lap. And I was like: 'I'm fine, thank you. I don't want to sit on your lap'.\" <br/>She said the MP was so persistent she felt she had no choice, and reluctantly agreed to \"get him off my case\". The MP is one of a number to be suspended over separate allegations.<br/>She said there was still a feeling among some MPs and senior staffers that they can do what they want without repercussions. \"There are big names in Westminster, and you kind of feel intimidated by them,\" she added. <br/>Ms Varley, who works as a parliamentary aide to Tory MP, Dehenna Davison, said incidents can include a \"hand on the hip in a social setting\". <br/>\"I [often think] am I reading too much into this? Are you just being friendly or are you touching me because you think you can?\" she added.<br/>\"I've had it when people have texted me incessantly being like: 'Are you out tonight?' 'What are you doing?' And not getting the hint if I don't reply after you've messaged six times.\"<br/>She said she was \"frankly just angry\" and claimed people in the palace do not feel safe to report issues: \"They don't have the trust in the system. I'm just fed up.\"<br/>The six parliamentary staff said inappropriate touching and flirting was still a problem - with younger staff sometimes preyed upon by older MPs and staffers. <br/>Five of the people we spoke to currently work in the Commons, while one of them has recently left their role on the estate. The ex-staff member said she saw the same behaviour take place repeatedly.  <br/>\"In the bars you'd still see male MPs all over staffers; in their physical space, buying them drinks and actually behaving in a pretty disgusting state - touching bums and putting their hands all over their lower backs. It's lecherous.\" <br/>She added: \"You'd see male MPs openly ogle female staffers and comment to them about how they looked in an overly flirty sense or they'd talk among each other about who was fit or not.\" Some male MPs talked about female MPs in the same way, she added.  <br/>In 2018, Parliament set up the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), to investigate complaints about inappropriate behaviour, such as bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct, and to provide advice to complainants.  <br/>Since then, complaints are investigated by independent investigators, commissioned by the ICGS team on a case-by-case basis. However, one senior official, who has worked in the Commons for several years, said the scheme had made no difference to what he described as a \"predatory culture\". <br/>\"I wouldn't recommend it [HoC] as a safe place for any young men or women. If a young person I knew really really wanted to work in the House of Commons, it would come with a whole list of warnings about how to stay safe, who not to hang out with, where not to go\", he said.<br/>\"The same things still go on as before #metoo,\" he said, referencing the global social media movement that saw people share stories of sexual abuse, harassment and rape.<br/>He described the new complaints processes as \"useless\". \"Just ask anyone who has tried to use them\", he added.<br/>One of the criticisms of the ICGS is that investigations take too long.  <br/>According to its last annual report, of the 21 completed investigations it carried out in 2021-2022, 12 were cases where an MP was a respondent. These cases took an average time of 262 days. By comparison, cases involving parliamentary staff took an average of 186 days, and MPs' staff cases, took an average of 133 days.<br/>A Commons spokesman said the complaints scheme was the first of its kind in any Parliament in the world. \"It has enabled, and will continue to enable, Parliament to identify and deal effectively with unacceptable behaviour,\" they added.<br/>\"However, though much has been achieved in the last five years, we know there is more work to be done.\"<br/>Yet Ms Varley said she was \"disappointed\" so little has changed. She said \"too many people\" think reporting incidents is \"just not worth it\". \"It takes a long time and it can wear you down,\" she added.<br/>\"This is something that everyone will have a story of. Every staffer will know someone who has experienced this [sexual misconduct] and that's thousands of people who are employed here.\"<br/>\"I think it comes down to culture and you can't fix the culture overnight,\" she added. \"Until these people have repercussions for their actions, and until the victims have faith in the reporting process, I don't think anything's going to change.\"<br/>In a statement to the BBC, the ICGS said it \"is there to ensure that all complaints are dealt with in a manner that is fair, thorough, independent and efficient, offering support to all parties involved. The target to reduce the length of investigations must always be balanced against the paramount requirement to ensure that investigations are rigorous and robust.<br/>\"The ICGS always seeks to learn from every case, striving to deliver a compassionate and effective service that everyone in Parliament can be proud of, contributing to building a workplace where everyone feels safe and valued. <br/>\"The ICGS is here for every member of the parliamentary community - we urge anyone who needs it, to use it.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

This is no longer the case.  The UK is now seen as an unreliable partner.\"<br/>Mr Sunak insisted Lord Goldsmith had quit after being asked to apologise for comments he made about the Privileges Committee inquiry over the conduct of Boris Johnson and whether he had intentionally misled the House of Commons as PM.<br/>But Lord Goldsmith denied this, instead saying his decision to step down had been a \"long time coming\". <br/>The ICF refers to UK aid given to support vulnerable countries to deal with the causes of climate change, including preventing deforestation and reducing carbon emissions, as well as preparing for its effects. <br/>It forms a part of the global commitment to spend $100bn a year on climate finance for developing countries.<br/>PM wrong to say I refused to apologise - Goldsmith<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Her straight-talking style encompassed a lot of what the SNP wanted to be at Westminster - a renegade element in the Commons shaking things up and agitating for radical change.<br/>But now, she is the latest in what is becoming a string of SNP members to announce they will not stand in the next election.<br/>Is that too a symbol of something?<br/>Labour are gearing up for a big push to try to retake ground from the SNP - Mr Alexander is targeting a comeback of his own, albeit in a different seat.<br/>But Paisley and Renfrewshire South is fairly steady SNP territory these days, with Ms Black commanding a majority in excess of 10,000 votes in 2019 - or almost 25%.<br/>The salient point may be that no SNP MP really wants to be at Westminster, and the question of independence has for years now been caught in a log-jam.<br/>Perhaps what Ms Black fears isn't so much losing her seat - but the prospect of keeping it for the long term.<br/>Scottish Conservative Chairman Craig Hoy MSP described Ms Black's announcement as \"yet another damning verdict from a senior SNP MP on the failing leadership of both Humza Yousaf and Stephen Flynn\". <br/>He added: \"It speaks volumes about how bitter those feuds have become that Mhairi Black has thrown in the towel, just a few months after agreeing to become deputy leader, and decided not to fight another election despite not yet turning 30.\"<br/>Stewart Hosie to stand down at next election<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

He says the offer of a NatWest account came late last week.<br/>The former politician said the bank only did this when he \"went public\" with his story, and that it only offered him a personal account, not a business account. <br/>\"Well what use to me is that?\" he told the BBC. \"I operate through a business, that's how I live. Any income that comes to me personally comes through my business.\"<br/>The BBC understands that the offer of a NatWest account still stands.<br/>Mr Farage claims other banks have refused to take him on as a customer on the grounds that he is a \"politically exposed person\" (PEP). <br/>A PEP generally presents a higher risk for financial institutions as regulators consider such people to be more exposed to the risk of potential involvement in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position and the influence they may hold.<br/>Mr Farage told the BBC: \"Are you telling me that all the other banks say it was a PEP thing and Coutts wasn't? Draw your own conclusions.\"<br/>Speaking on GB News later on Tuesday, he questioned why Coutts's had been \"discussing my financial situation publicly,\" adding it was not \"ethical\".<br/>A Treasury spokesman said it would be a \"serious concern\" if financial services were being denied to those exercising their right to lawful free speech. <br/>\"We are already looking into this issue and have passed a law that requires the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to review how banks treat politically exposed persons - so we can strike the right balance between the customer's right to free speech and the bank's right to manage commercial risk.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Banks warned against closing accounts over politics<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It has already said it will appeal the decision at the Supreme Court.<br/>There has been concern about how children will be treated under the new migration bill, as well as accusations that existing UK regulations to prevent modern slavery would be undermined.<br/>Although the legal duty to deport migrants would not apply to under-18s the bill would give ministers new powers to deport them in certain circumstances. <br/>It would also get rid of the current three day-limit on how long children and pregnant women can be detained, as well as the 24-hour maximum for children unaccompanied by an adult.<br/>The government argues detention powers are necessary to ensure migrants destined for removal do not \"disappear into the community\" - and says no one would be held longer than is \"absolutely necessary\" to ensure they are deported.<br/>It adds that there is also an over-arching legal duty to ensure the length of detention is \"reasonable\", adding that leaving the UK voluntarily will \"always be an option for all\".<br/>However in series of votes on Wednesday, a handful of Conservatives teamed up with opposition peers to preserve the detention limits.<br/>Tory peer Baroness Mobarik, who proposed the amendments, said \"verbal assurances\" from ministers were not enough and \"necessary safeguards\" had to be added to the bill itself.<br/>\"The psychological harms of detention on young children is significant and likely to impact them for the rest of their lives,\" she added.<br/>Immigration Minister Lord Murray of Blidworth said safeguards were already in place for the detention of pregnant women, whilst those in the later stages of pregnancy would be released on immigration bail.<br/>Child detention was also a contentious issue when the bill was debated in the Commons, with the government avoiding a showdown with Tory rebels by promising to listen to concerns.<br/>Tim Loughton, who spearheaded the rebellion, said at the time he wanted a maximum limit to remain.<br/>In other votes on Monday, the Lords voted to ban deportations of LGBT migrants to 10 mainly African countries, including Rwanda, Nigeria and Kenya - with a specific ban on trans men and women being deported to Brazil.<br/>When the proposed bans were initially debated last week, Crossbench peer Lord Etherton, who suggested them, said the countries were \"hostile and unsafe\" for LGBT people.<br/>Peers also approved an amendment to retain the role of the courts in deciding what a \"reasonable\" length of detention is - striking down new powers in the bill that would allow ministers to decide. <br/>Illegal migrants plan could cost \u00a36bn over two years<br/>Migration Bill 'breaches' human rights obligations<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

unless that is endorsed by the UK government's own foreign policy. <br/>First published last month, it received initial backing by 268 to 70 votes after several hours of debate in the House of Commons on Monday.<br/>Much of the debate on the issue has focused on boycotts of Israel and Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.<br/>The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement calls for broad-based economic and cultural boycotts of Israel and Israel settlements - similar to those applied to South Africa in the apartheid era. <br/>Such boycotts are backed by Palestinians who see them as applying pressure on Israel to end its military occupation. <br/>The Israeli government, on the other hand, sees the entire BDS movement as unjustly singling out Israel and describes it as antisemitic.<br/>Speaking in the Commons, Mr Gove said there had been an \"increase in antisemitic events following on from the activities of the BDS movement\".<br/>He added that although there were \"legitimate reasons to criticise the Israeli government\", the BDS movement was asking councils to \"treat Israel differently from any other nation on the globe\".<br/>\"Nothing in this bill prevents or impedes the loudest of criticisms of Israel's government and leaders,\" he added.<br/>But Labour - and a number of Conservative MPs - raised concerns about the bill's potential impact on UK foreign policy.<br/>Dame Margaret Hodge, who served in Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, said the proposed legislation was \"flawed, poorly drafted and will have damaging consequences both here and abroad\".<br/>\"The bill is not a considered attempt to bring about peace, provide better security for Israel or respond to the threats posed by BDS,\" she said.<br/>\"It's about using Jews as a pawn in the government's political game.\"<br/>Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the government must remove references to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories from the bill. <br/>She said the bill \"essentially gives exceptional impunity to Israel\", adding: \"This is something we should not give to any country and I would be standing here making the same request if any country was named.\"<br/>Longstanding UK government policy calls for an end to Israel's military occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territories as part of a negotiated \"two-state solution\".  <br/>The UK has for decades endorsed the position of international law, under which Israeli settlements are seen as illegal - although Israel disputes this - and sees their expansion as an \"obstacle to peace\". <br/>The bill does not stop public bodies from complying with UK-wide sanctions, and it gives the government the power to make certain countries exempt from the restrictions. <br/>For example, the government intends Russia and Belarus to be exempted. <br/>But the bill does not allow the rules to exempt Israel, the Occupied Territories or the Occupied Golan Heights. <br/>In doing so, it groups the three territories together, which critics including Labour argue undermines the UK's foreign policy position by suggesting boycotting Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories or Golan Heights would be the same as boycotting Israel - despite the illegality of the former two under international law. <br/>Critics have also raised concerns that the bill would limit campaigns against human rights abuses in other parts of the world - such as against the Uyghur in Xinjiang, China. <br/>Ahead of the vote on Monday, the government spokesperson said: \"Public bodies should not be pursuing their own foreign policy agenda.<br/>\"The bill will not hinder the robust action we are taking against Uyghur forced labour in supply chains as it contains exceptions to the ban for labour related misconduct, including modern slavery.<br/>\"The ban on boycotts does not apply to individuals, including publicly elected officials, when carrying out private acts that are protected by the Human Rights Act.\"<br/>A Labour amendment to the bill was defeated in the Commons by 272 votes to 212 - a margin of 60. <br/>The amendment had sought to decline the bill a second reading over concerns it \"risks significantly undermining support\" for groups around the world facing persecution, for example the Uyghur, who are \"currently victims of grave and systemic human rights abuses\". <br/>It said it opposed any \"discrimination\" by public bodies in how they spend their money and says all public bodies must act \"without bias\" when making decisions on procurement and investment.<br/>Israeli military launches major operation in Jenin<br/>The Israel-Palestinian conflict explained<br/>US declares Israel boycott group BDS anti-Semitic<br/>Germany labels Israel boycott anti-Semitic<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' -

Motorists face a maximum \u00a3160 fine if they do not pay. <br/>Lorries, buses, coaches and heavy vans which are non-compliant are charged \u00a3100 under a separate low emission zone scheme, which already covers most of London.<br/>Claims that nine out of 10 cars already complied with ULEZ standards in outer London were based on data from just 106 cameras, the High Court heard.<br/>The barrister for the councils said people should have been told this during the consultation last year. \"This is key information which was not available\", said Mr Howell Williams.<br/>He added that consultees might have concluded that forecast compliance rates from such a small number of cameras were \"unlikely to be reliable given the size of the area being covered\".<br/>Transport for London (TfL) submitted information about its ANPR camera network ahead of the judicial review proceedings. It shows that while there are 1,156 cameras gathering data in the inner London \"middle ring\" of ULEZ, there were just 106 cameras covering the whole of outer London on which it based its claims about compliance.<br/>In the lead-up to the judicial review, the BBC repeatedly requested data from the Mayor of London and TfL on how the 91% compliance rate was calculated. <br/>Both bodies refused to make this information public.<br/>Ben Jaffey KC, representing the mayor and TfL, said the use of ANPR camera data was \"one of several different inputs into a complex model of compliance rates, traffic, emissions and air quality\".<br/>The barrister said TfL had been \"clear\" that camera coverage was \"not comprehensive\" and that for \"full enforcement\" it would install 2,750 more cameras.<br/>Mr Howell Williams, acting on behalf of Bexley, Bromley, Harrow, Hillingdon and Surrey councils, told the judicial review that Mr Khan did not have the legal right to vary existing regulations in this way.<br/>In written arguments, he added that the mayor and TfL's approach would \"bypass legal safeguards\", which were \"designed to ensure that any new charging scheme was properly considered before coming into effect\".<br/>The councils' barrister said material provided when gathering views on the plans was \"unintelligible\" and gave a \"confused picture\".<br/>As a result, \"intelligent responses were prevented\", Mr Howell Williams said.<br/>The barrister also said the mayor's plans for a \u00a3110m scrappage scheme, to provide grants to people to support them getting rid of non-compliant vehicles, were also unlawful because a \"buffer zone\" for \"non-Londoners\" affected by the extended charging zone was not considered.<br/>Mr Jaffey said in his written arguments that the \"primary objective\" was \"to improve London's air quality, in particular reducing nitrogen oxides and particulates\".<br/>The barrister said Mr Khan's decisions would help to get London's air quality closer to legal limits, in the areas where it is exceeded, and for World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines to be reached everywhere.<br/>He added that over the past 16 years, London's mayors had used powers to order changes to emissions zones rules in the capital on many occasions.<br/>\"It would be bizarre if orders could not be amended to improve emissions standards as required,\" the barrister said, adding that \"one might expect it to have come up before now\".<br/>Mr Jaffey went on: \"The consultation materials were clear, detailed and provided more than ample information to enable an intelligent response and satisfy the requirements of fairness for consultations.\"<br/>He said Mr Khan had \"personally considered\" the level of funding available for the scrappage scheme and had \"rationally\" concluded it would mitigate some of the impact of the ULEZ expansion.<br/>Mr Jaffey added: \"Where there are finite public funds, if there are good reasons for giving preference to Londoners, that inevitably means not giving others the same benefit. These are discretionary public spending decisions.\"<br/>The hearing, before Mr Justice Swift, is due to conclude on Wednesday and the judge is expected to give his ruling at a later date.<br/>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

He said he simply wouldn't want to win a game in the manner Australia did,\" the spokesman added.<br/>Despite Mr Sunak's verbal shot at Australia's cricketers, the Bairstow controversy is unlikely to spark a diplomatic incident between the UK and Australia.<br/>When Mr Sunak met Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Downing Street this May, the pair said they looked forward to a summer of strong sporting rivalry between two nations.<br/>Responding to Mr Sunak's intervention, the Australian high commissioner to the UK, Stephen Smith, told the BBC that every cricket follower will have formed a view about what happened Lord's.<br/>\"And those views will invariably be strongly held and firmly put,\" he said. \"The Ashes has always had such moments.\"<br/>However his predecessor Alexander Downer took a more robust line, telling the Sun newspaper the incident had made England look like \"bad losers\".<br/>\"They lost and so they're now screaming blue murder about it and it wasn't fair. Boo hoo,\" he added.<br/>Australia head coach Andrew McDonald defended his team's actions, saying he didn't see \"too many issues with it\".<br/>\"There is no doubt that when a player is leaving their crease that you take that opportunity,\" he added.<br/>Cricket's laws say the ball is dead \"when it is clear to the bowler's end umpire that the fielding side and both batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play\".<br/>Stokes said: \"When is it justified that the umpires have called over? Is the on-field umpires making movement... is that enough to call over? I'm not sure.<br/>\"I am not disputing the fact it is out because it is out,\" he added. \"Would I want to win a game in that manner? The answer for me is no.\"<br/>The dismissal, which left England needing 178 runs with four wickets left, created a hostile atmosphere, with Australia's team being booed by the traditionally subdued Lord's crowd.<br/>It also led to angry exchanges in the Long Room, an area outside the team dressing rooms, between Australia players Usman Khawaja and David Warner and spectators.<br/>The MCC said it had suspended three of its members after the \"completely unacceptable\" scenes and apologised to the Australia team.<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>I've never seen a day like that at Lord's - Agnew<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Sunak to drastically cut migration, warning the failure to do so \"risks eroding public trust\".<br/>The New Conservatives have issued a 12-point plan to cut net migration by about 400,000 before the next election.<br/>The group of MPs recommend closing visa schemes for care workers, increasing salary thresholds, and capping refugee numbers.<br/>But critics say the proposals would have consequences for the UK economy.<br/>Mr Sunak's official spokesman said the government believes it is \"striking the right balance between keeping migration as low as possible while providing staff for key areas\".<br/>The UK's overall population grew by more than 600,000 people last year, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.<br/>The ONS said the rise was largely driven by more people from outside the EU arriving on student and work visas, and refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in Ukraine and Hong Kong.<br/>The sharp increase represents a huge political challenge for Mr Sunak and the Conservatives, who have repeatedly promised to reduce net migration since taking power in 2010.<br/>The party's 2019 manifesto committed to getting the number down, without setting a specific target, while former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron once pledged to bring net migration below 100,000.<br/>In a report launched on Monday, the New Conservatives say the British public \"did not vote for mass migration and the social and economic harms it brings\".<br/>\"Without swift action to get migration under control, the Conservative Party will further erode the trust of hundreds of thousands of voters who lent the party their vote in 2019,\" the report says.<br/>The report was written by Tory MP Tom Hunt and backed by a group of like-minded Conservatives, including the party's deputy chairman, Lee Anderson, Miriam Cates and James Daly.<br/>At the report's launch, Mr Hunt, Ms Cates and Mr Daly insisted they were loyal to the prime minister, but felt his government could go further on cutting immigration.<br/>One of the report's main recommendations is closing temporary schemes that grant eligibility for worker visas to care workers.<br/>The report says this policy will reduce visas granted by 117,000, leading to a reduction in long-term inward migration to the UK of 82,000.<br/>Part of this proposed policy involves only allowing in skilled workers who earn \u00a338,000 a year or more.<br/>A report by the Skills for Care charity said the number of vacancies in social care was at its highest rate on record, with 165,000 unfilled posts in 2021-22.<br/>Sam Monaghan, chief executive at Methodist Homes, said not being able to recruit carers from overseas would put more pressure on the sector.<br/>\"Cutting off a key supply of care workers at a time when 500,000 people nationwide are waiting for care is not the answer,\" Mr Monaghan said.<br/>Mr Sunak's official spokesman said the government was not planning to remove care workers from the shortage occupation list.<br/>The government was \"using the flexibility we have through our migration system to ensure we have sufficient staff in key areas\" and \"looking to boost the numbers of domestic care staff that are available\", Downing Street said.<br/>Ms Cates told the BBC the UK needed to cut off the supply of cheap foreign Labour and encourage from British people to fill jobs in the care sector.<br/>She said scrapping temporary visa schemes for care workers would force \"employers to look at recruiting local young people\". <br/>\"We are never ever going to make that possible unless we close the immigration route first,\" the Tory MP said.<br/>But fellow Tory MP Tim Loughton said while the principle of reducing met migration was right, there was a shortage of care workers in the UK.<br/>\"It's not as simple as just putting the salary thresholds up as well,\" he said. \"There's quite a lot of skilled but lower paid people that we need coming into this country.\"<br/>Some of the report's other proposals include: <br/>Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said \"trying to predict the impact of individual policy changes on migration is very hard\".<br/>\"Even the most fastidious attempts to model the impacts of policy on numbers - and this isn't one of them - will usually be wrong,\" she said.<br/>She said immigration policy was a \"political choice\" and there was \"no reason the UK couldn't choose to be more restrictive\".<br/>But she said the report does not \"engage with any of the trade-offs that more restrictive measures involve\".<br/>\"For example, one of the reasons demand for care workers has been so high is limited public funding in the care system,\" Ms Sumption said. <br/>\"International students have been a growing source of revenue for universities, so proposals that would reduce student numbers cannot be considered in isolation from the funding of higher education.\"<br/>She said some of the proposals in the report were \"a bit outlandish\".<br/>\"Net migration is expected to decline anyway over the coming years even without policy changes,\" she added. \"However, if they want more significant restrictions it requires an honest conversation about the wider consequences and how to mitigate them.\"<br/>Sunak denies he's

They were later reinstated by the US payments company.<br/>The government subsequently announced a review into payment services regulations, including the practice of firms apparently closing down the accounts of people or businesses that hold views the lender does not agree with. <br/>Ms Frazer told LBC, the radio station: \"I'm concerned people's accounts might be closed for the wrong reasons and it's something they [the banks] should be thinking about carefully.<br/>\"Banks are regulated, and those are the sort of things regulators should consider.\"<br/>Mr Farage said that he was told two months ago that his bank, who he did not name but is understood to be Coutts, was closing down his personal and business accounts. <br/>The BBC has approached Coutts' parent company NatWest for comment.<br/>Mr Farage, who is the former leader of UKIP and a former member of the European Parliament, suggested that the reason for the decision could be related to laws that banks follow on \"politically exposed person\" or PEPs. <br/>These are people who hold a prominent position or influence who may be more susceptible to being involved in bribery or corruption.<br/>Banks are required to do extra due diligence on PEPs. <br/>Mr Farage said he was told by his bank that closing his accounts was a \"commercial decision\".<br/>UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said lenders should discuss the closure of an account with a customer \"so far as is feasible and permissible\".<br/>It said though there will \"be situations where it may not be appropriate or permissible for a bank to engage in a dialogue to explain their reasoning\". <br/>This would include a breach of terms and conditions, \"abusive or threatening behaviour to colleagues\" or if banks have been directed not to by \"regulators, HM Government, police and other authorities\".<br/>Mr Farage said he approached seven other banks to open personal and business accounts and was turned down by all of them.<br/>However, he claimed there were other reasons why his existing bank acted. <br/>\"Either for reasons of being active in politics, or having opinions that modern day corporate banks don't agree with, far too many accounts have been closed in recent years,\" he told the BBC.<br/>\"I hope that my case blows the lid off the whole thing and that we can get changes to legislation. Everyone in the UK should be entitled to a bank account.\"<br/>Speaking in the House of Commons on Monday, security minister Tom Tugendhat, said \"This sort of closure, on political grounds - if that is indeed what has happened and after all we only have the allegation of it at this point - should be completely unacceptable.<br/>\"PEPs is there to prevent the corrupt use of banking facilities by politicians in corrupt regimes.

Mr Barclay told Laura Kuenssberg he is \"ready to have discussions\" on other issues, such as how consultants' pay progresses over time.<br/>\"There's things we're open to discussing, but we need to get the balance right,\" he said.<br/>The health service has been plagued by strike action throughout this year, with doctors, nurses, ambulance workers, porters and others walking out in disputes, mainly over pay. <br/>A breakthrough came in May, when unions representing all NHS staff except doctors and dentists backed a deal to receive a 5% pay rise. <br/>However, junior doctors and hospital consultants have still not reached an agreement with the government.<br/>Health is a devolved issue, meaning this only relates to the NHS in England.<br/>Ms Pritchard acknowledged that it would be several years before the situation in the health sector returned to anything like good enough, and stressed that the service was doing all it could to bring waiting lists down. <br/>NHS England says more than 600,000 appointments have been cancelled in previous strikes. The ongoing failure of the government and some of the medical unions to find agreement is only going to crank the pressure up still further. <br/>Ms Pritchard called for the industrial action to be brought to an end as soon as possible, saying it cannot become \"business as usual in the NHS\". <br/>She also discussed NHS England's new 15-year workforce plan, which she introduced alongside Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier this week. <br/>The NHS currently has one out of every 10 posts unfilled, creating major pressure on staff and leading to long waiting times for patients.<br/>The new plan is focused on training and retaining more staff. Ms Pritchard said the plan is not an \"overnight\" fix , but that it is part of efforts to \"treat people as quickly as possible, without delay\". <br/>Also on the show was former Conservative health minister Lord Bethell who described the current approach to treatment in the NHS as \"rationing\". <br/>\"If someone has a need for an operation and you simply don't have the resources to give them what they need then you are going beyond the important protocols of allocating scarce resources in the best way possible and you are being defined by the amount of resources that you have available,\" he said.<br/>\"I think that there is a difference between reasonable allocation of resources and making tough decision which is part of every day life, and having to cope with a system as overwhelmed with illness.\"<br/>Senior doctors back strike action in England<br/>Junior doctors to strike for five days in July<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

I'd be keen to hear of domestic abuse policies she has in her school or teaching plans, perhaps I'll write.\" <br/>On Saturday, Ms Birbalsingh posted an open letter to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on her Twitter account, writing that Ms Phillips' behaviour was \"a clear example of 'unconscious bias'\". <br/>In the four-page letter, she wrote that Ms Phillips \"hates me, despite not knowing me, because she subscribes to the idea that black and Asian individuals in public life owe a duty to voice opinions that match with a left wing view of the world, or they are worthy of her contempt\".<br/>Ms Birbalsingh said that she was not suggesting Ms Phillips \"hates all people of colour\".<br/>She added that Ms Phillips called into question her school's safeguarding policies \"in a deliberate attempt to challenge my competence as a headteacher\". <br/>She said that after Ms Phillips' tweets, people contacted her institution saying it was \"unsafe for female teachers and pupils\". She said the Teaching Regulation Agency had been contacted with a demand that she be struck off.<br/>Asked on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday show whether she thought Ms Phillips was racist, Ms Phillipson said: \"No, I don't.

Teachers are eligible to apply for the payments from September 2023 and March 2024. <br/>Academies and free schools in England have been able to recruit teachers without formal teaching qualifications since 2012, when the requirement was scrapped by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government. <br/>It is unclear if the new policy would affect private schools, which are also able to recruit teachers without formal qualifications. <br/>Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), welcomed Labour's plans but said the party could still do more. <br/>\"Schools are in the middle of a recruitment and retention crisis, so it is right that Labour should make this a high priority,\" he said.<br/>\"The ambition for every class to be taught by a qualified teacher is also welcome - every parent should be able to expect that their child is taught by someone with the requisite expertise.<br/>\"Plans to improve early career training and ongoing professional development are sensible but Labour will need to be prepared to go further if they are to begin to solve the current crisis.<br/>\"We know that issues such as uncompetitive pay and a punitive inspection system are key factors in pushing people out of the profession, and it is only by tackling these that we will see teaching and school leadership become an attractive proposition once again.\"<br/>In a statement, a spokesperson for the Conservative Party said: \"We have seen yet more evidence this morning that Labour cannot be trusted on a word they say.<br/>\"Labour have flip-flopped so many times on education policy there is no guarantee they will actually stick to this latest announcement.<br/>\"Only the Conservatives are delivering on education and driving up literacy rates - putting parents and pupils first.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

No 10 asked me to acknowledge that, and made clear that there was no question of my being 'sacked' if I did so. I was - and am - happy to do so.  \"My decision to step down has been a long time coming.\"<br/>In a scathing resignation letter, which did not mention the Privileges Committee report, Lord Goldsmith said he had been \"horrified\" at the government abandoning its environmental commitments and withdrawing its leadership on the world stage. <br/>He cited a flagship animal welfare bill being ditched, as well as an abandoned pledge to spend \u00a311.6bn of UK aid on climate and environment. <br/>Lord Goldsmith told BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt the pledge would not be met because of \"low levels of expenditure so far\", combined with a decision to classify spending on Afghan and Ukrainian refugees in the UK as overseas aid.<br/>Small island nations would be left \"feeling utterly betrayed,\" whilst \"our reputation as a reliable partner will simply be shredded,\" he added.<br/>However, in a letter to Lord Goldsmith, Mr Sunak said: \"You were asked to apologise for your comments about the Privileges Committee as we felt they were incompatible with your position as a Minister of the Crown. You have decided to take a different course.\"<br/>He said Lord Goldsmith had been \"a vocal advocate of some of the most important issues that the UK and the world face today\". <br/>Mr Sunak added: \"The UK continues to play an important role globally in tackling climate change and preserving the environment.\"<br/>It comes two days after a government climate watchdog warned the UK had lost its leadership on climate issues. <br/>As a minister in the Foreign Office, Lord Goldsmith had responsibility for Asia, energy, climate and the environment. <br/>Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he did not agree with Lord Goldsmith's comments about Mr Sunak's attitude towards the environment.<br/>He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"I know the prime minister is as proud as I am that the UK has reduced our emissions by more than any other advanced economy. We have led the way when it comes to climate issues internationally.\"<br/>But, he added, the government needed to get the economy \"back on track\" to be able to \"continue to invest at the rate we want to in the transition to net zero\".<br/>Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats had called for Lord Goldsmith to resign after the Privilege Committee report's publication on Thursday. <br/>However, Mr Sunak's official spokesman had said the prime minister continued to have full confidence in him. <br/>Lib Dem spokeswoman Sarah Olney, who won her Richmond Park seat from Lord Goldsmith in 2019, said Mr Sunak \"should have had the guts\" to sack him. <br/>Ms Olney claimed his resignation confirmed the government \"doesn't give a damn about the environment and animal rights\".<br/>Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said: \"Rishi Sunak's weakness is laid bare as 24 hours after he refused to condemn Zac Goldsmith, Goldsmith scathingly condemns him.\"<br/>Former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, another close ally of Mr Johnson who was named in the Privileges Committee report, said Lord Goldsmith's \"passion\" for the environment was \"second to none\" and that the government had been \"lucky\" to have him. <br/>The committee's report said \"unprecedented and co-ordinated pressure\" was placed on its members, who were investigating whether former Prime Minister Mr Johnson had misled Parliament over lockdown parties at Downing Street. <br/>A tweet by Lord Goldsmith, in which he expressed support for the view that the inquiry was a \"witch hunt\" and a \"kangaroo court\", was cited in the report's evidence. <br/>However, other Tories named in the report accused the committee of trying to shut down freedom of speech. <br/>Mr Johnson announced he was resigning as an MP days before the committee published its initial findings, branding the investigation a \"kangaroo court\".<br/>The year-long inquiry found Mr Johnson made multiple deliberately misleading statements to Parliament about lockdown parties at Downing Street.<br/>It ruled he should have been suspended for 90 days had he remained in the Commons.<br/>The sanction, which was lengthy by recent standards, would have been likely to trigger a by-election in Mr Johnson's constituency.<br/>Lord Goldsmith, a close ally of Mr Johnson, previously served as a junior environment minister in his government. <br/>He was made a peer by Mr Johnson after losing his seat as Conservative MP for Richmond Park to the Liberal Democrats in the 2019 general election. <br/>He was first elected as an MP in 2010, and in 2016 ran unsuccessfully to be the mayor of London. <br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Johnson allies interfered with Partygate probe - report<br/>Chris Mason: Free speech collides with committee doing its job<br/>Ministers criticised after dropping animal bill<br/>UK no longer a world leader on climate - watchdog<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

set to take place on Monday - is politically motivated. <br/>Some Tories had expressed anger that she was offered a job as the Labour leader's chief of staff, arguing it undermined the impartiality of her inquiry into lockdown-breaking parties.<br/>Her report prompted numerous MPs to call for then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson's resignation and contributed to his downfall. <br/>Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) are not binding, but both Labour and Ms Gray had said they would abide by them. <br/>Sir Keir said he was \"delighted\" Ms Gray would be working for the party, adding she would \"lead our work preparing for a mission-led Labour government\". <br/>\"She brings unrivalled experience on how the machinery of government works and is a woman of great integrity,\" he added.<br/>With a general election expected next year, Ms Gray will play a key role in helping Labour prepare for government, if it wins power. <br/>Civil servants - who develop and implement government policies - are expected to be politically impartial. <br/>Ms Gray told Acoba she received a call from Sir Keir in October last year, when he raised the idea of her working for Labour in a senior capacity. <br/>The committee said it was \"quite normal for individuals to discuss the possibility of new roles before leaving office\" but \"any potential conflict must be declared\". <br/>Cabinet Office Minister Jeremy Quin has tabled a written ministerial statement for Monday. <br/>It is expected to say that Ms Gray broke the civil service code - which sets out the standards of behaviour civil servants are expected to follow - by failing to declare her conversation with Sir Keir to ministers. <br/>However, the department will not be able to impose any retrospective punishments.<br/>Cabinet Office sources said Sir Keir, as a former civil servant - he was director of public prosecutions from 2008-13 - should have been aware of the rules and they will accuse him of not ensuring that Ms Gray disclosed her contact with him. <br/>Ms Gray resigned from the civil service on 2 March, following media speculation about a potential job offer from Labour, but she told the committee there was no formal offer of employment until that date. <br/>She said that while she had brief personal conversations with Labour during her time in office, no government business was discussed. <br/>The committee said there was no evidence her contact with Labour had impacted her actions in her civil service role or her ability to remain impartial. <br/>It added that there was \"limited scope for Ms Gray to offer unfair influence in securing access to government\". <br/>However, it said there remained \"a potential risk to the perceived impartiality of the civil service that would be exacerbated\" if she took up the job immediately on leaving office. <br/>Under the civil service code, officials of Ms Gray's seniority must wait a minimum of three months before taking up outside employment.<br/>As well as a six-month break, the committee also recommended Ms Gray should not be personally involved in lobbying the government on behalf of the opposition for two years from the date she left the civil service. <br/>Government departments had called for a 12-month break, arguing there was a risk the appointment weakened public trust in the impartiality of the civil service.<br/>Ms Gray, who joined the civil service in the 1970s, was asked in 2021 by Mr Johnson to investigate lockdown-breaking gatherings in government buildings. <br/>Her final report, published in May 2022, concluded that several events breached Covid rules and that there were \"failures of leadership\" in No 10. <br/>Mr Johnson has previously said the job offer from Labour raised questions over the conclusions of her inquiry. <br/>Other responsibilities Ms Gray had as a civil servant included a programme to improve relations between the nations that make up the UK.<br/>She was also in charge of introducing the controversial voter ID scheme, which Labour has spoken out against. <br/>Tory anger at Labour job for Partygate probe chief<br/>Who is Sue Gray, civil servant in row over Labour job?<br/>Sue Gray: Inside track on an almighty row<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' -

They can work in GP surgeries or hospitals. <br/>The new roles will mean more qualified staff can focus on spending time with their patients.<br/>There is also a boost in training places for other roles, including pharmacists, psychologists and dental therapists.<br/>In the next five years, the proportion of NHS staff, including physios, podiatrists and maternity staff, trained through apprenticeships - combining paid work with study and no tuition fees - will double, to one out of every six.<br/>And next year, an apprenticeship for doctors will launch, with a few hundred places.<br/>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday, Mr Barclay said senior NHS leaders had told him the plan \"gives hope to the system\" in the long term.<br/>He said patients will not see some of the benefits for several years, but added that reforms and measures to improve staff retention \"will come through quite quickly\".<br/>Gemma Peffers is one of thousands of people to have already started a nursing apprenticeship - in 2016, aged 30, at Royal Derby Hospital.<br/>\"I left school not knowing what to do,\" she says. \"I had lots of different jobs.\"<br/>Ms Peffers has now qualified as a nursing associate and her next step will be to start two years of training to become a nurse.<br/>Learning on the job has been really beneficial, Ms Peffers says.<br/>\"We are learning the ethos of the NHS and getting to know how our patients want to be looked after,\" she says.<br/>And earning while she learns is important too. <br/>\"I've got children and a house to run,\" says Ms Peffers. \"The security is really important and has enabled me to pursue a career in the NHS.\"<br/>There will also be a major drive on retention - including more flexible-working options and career development to provide clear routes to senior jobs. Last year, more than 40,000 nurses left the NHS.<br/>The plan is being welcomed by many in the health service.<br/>Matthew Taylor, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health trusts, called it \"bold and ambitious\".<br/>But he said the same commitment was now needed for the social care workforce.<br/>Others have pointed out the drive to increase training places could be undermined by the lack of placements on the front line - half of a student nurse's degree is spent working in the NHS.<br/>It will also take years before this expansion starts to have an impact on current shortages - it takes five years to complete a medical degree and three a nursing degree.<br/>There are challenges making sure the expansion of training places is successful. The first one is making sure there are enough people interested in pursuing a career in healthcare. <br/>That is less of a problem for doctors because medical degrees are heavily oversubscribed. <br/>But the number of applications for nursing degrees is falling, with universities saying the cost of living crisis is putting people off.<br/>However, perhaps the biggest challenge of all is ensuring existing staff are retained - nurses are leaving the NHS almost as quickly as new ones are joining. <br/>There has been very little detail so far about how this will be addressed - and of course pay is not part of this plan, and that is a key factor in keeping staff.<br/>Pay awards going forwards will be determined by two things - the size of the NHS budget and what is happening with inflation.<br/>It is why the \u00a32.4bn committed to boost training in this plan over the next five years is being welcomed, but on its own will not determine its success.<br/>Are you training to join the NHS workforce through an apprenticeship?

this kind of caveat being included is not unheard of.<br/>But it is unusual.<br/>And it will be a concern for party leader Humza Yousaf given the ongoing narrative about the governance of the SNP, particularly on financial matters.<br/>The accounts themselves will not be published for some time - so it's telling that the party decided to get ahead of matters by making an announcement, rather than see it leak out of the NEC.<br/>Mr Yousaf is keen to be seen to be taking the issue head on, having promised to review how the SNP is run.<br/>He will want to remain on the front foot wherever matters are within his control - being acutely aware that auditors are not the only ones checking his party's receipts, and like everyone else he can only wait to see how the police investigation concludes.<br/>The information was outlined at a meeting of the party's National Executive Committee on Thursday evening, which approved the accounts for 2022. <br/>Party treasurer Stuart McDonald said: \"We have already engaged with auditors and implemented administrative changes in accordance with their recommendations and will continue to do so.  <br/>\"Our learning from this process will also feed into the governance review which is under way, and which will see us adopt the best practice and procedures in terms of oversight.\"<br/>The SNP had to find new auditors when the Johnston Carmichael firm quit after working with the party for more than a decade.<br/>Johnston Carmichael informed the SNP of its decision last September, but it was not made public by the party at the time. <br/>Mr Yousaf has said he only found that the party no longer had auditors in place after he won the contest to succeed Nicola Sturgeon as SNP leader in March. <br/>Mr Yousaf announced at the time that the party would carry out a review of its governance and transparency.<br/>The party initially struggled to find another auditor willing to take on the work, but eventually appointed Manchester-based firm AMS Accountants Group at the start of May.<br/>AMS managed to submit accounts for the SNP's Westminster group to parliamentary authorities by the end of that month, which it needed to do to avoid losing up to \u00a31.2m in public funding. <br/>It must now file accounts for the party as a whole with the Electoral Commission in July. <br/>The party is still at the centre of an ongoing police investigation into its finances and funding which has seen officers arrest Ms Sturgeon, her husband Peter Murrell - the party former chief executive - and former treasurer Colin Beattie.<br/>All three were subsequently released without charge while further inquiries are carried out. <br/>Mr Murrell had been the SNP chief executive since 1999 but quit in March after it emerged the party had given misleading information about its membership numbers to the media. <br/>The Glasgow home of Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell was searched as part of the investigation, as was the party's HQ in Edinburgh, with several boxes seen being removed from both properties. <br/>A luxury motorhome was also removed from outside the home of Mr Murrell's mother in Dunfermline. <br/>The police inquiry centres of what happened to more than \u00a3660,000 of funds given to the party by activists to be spent on a future independence referendum.<br/>Speaking after being released from police custody on 11 June, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I know beyond doubt that I am in fact innocent of any wrongdoing.\"<br/>SNP's Westminster group submits accounts on time<br/>SNP appoints new auditors as deadline looms<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Homeowners are being whacked by higher mortgage rates. Small boat crossings reached a new June record this year. The prime minister's five targets are looking increasingly challenging. <br/>A few weeks ago, one senior backbencher I spoke to had been cautiously optimistic that Rishi Sunak could turn things around. There's little sign of that positivity now.<br/>\"It's looking more and more difficult,\" they told me this week. <br/>That growing pessimism is not the ideal backdrop for a governing party to go into a set of by-elections, which will be an important indicator of the political mood in the country. <br/>In fact, it's possible the Conservatives could be about to lose five seats. <br/>Yes, five. Let me explain. <br/>Firstly, three by-elections are taking place in two weeks' time - and the Conservatives think they might lose them all.<br/>There's the west London seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where Boris Johnson had been the MP until he resigned from Parliament. Labour need to win areas like this if they are going to form the next government, so this seat is a must win on 20 July. <br/>There are some nerves in the Labour Party that ULEZ is proving to be a key issue. The low emissions scheme is being extended by Labour mayor of London Sadiq Khan - and the Conservatives are putting opposition at the centre of the campaign. Labour politicians admit it's proving a problem for them on the doorsteps. Their candidate said this week it wasn't the right time to expand the scheme. <br/>But the consensus so far is that it's unlikely ULEZ anger will be enough to save the seat for the Tories. <br/>Labour is optimistic and senior Tories who have visited the area say the loss might not be as bad as some feared - but is likely to be a loss, nonetheless.<br/>There's also Selby and Ainsty, which had been the North Yorkshire seat of Conservative Nigel Adams, a Boris Johnson ally who quit Parliament at the same time. <br/>On the face of it, this should be safe seat for the Conservatives - they won 60% of vote in 2019 and had a majority of 20,137. <br/>But Labour are eyeing up another scalp here. They think it's possible a mixture of national frustration with the government and local frustration at Mr Adams could help them overturn that majority. <br/>Then there's Somerton and Frome in Somerset. The Conservatives have held this seat since 2015, with another huge majority of 19,213 in 2019. But Tory David Warburton quit Parliament after he was accused of sexual misconduct and drug taking and the Liberal Democrats think they are on track to cause another major upset.<br/>The party is throwing resources at the seat - leader Ed Davey has visited four times since the by-election was confirmed in mid June. Party activists report frustration with the Conservatives that the last MP was embroiled in scandal and remained in post for so long.<br/>One strategist said: \"Everything is looking like it's going in the right direction\u2026 Rishi Sunak hasn't been able to stem the flood of voters put off by Boris Johnson.\"<br/>A bad night for the Conservatives on 20 July could see Mr Sunak become the first prime minister for decades to lose three by-elections in one day. <br/>As the senior Tory backbencher mentioned earlier puts it: \"My central expectation is that we lose all three.\" <br/>Although there is little appetite for another leadership challenge, that would set off another debate about what's going wrong and how to fix it.<br/>Some think the party isn't being radical enough on issues like immigration. Others argue Mr Sunak has been too radical - and moved away from the political centre. <br/>But there could be worse to come. <br/>We're expecting a by-election in Mid Bedfordshire soon. We don't know when, because former culture secretary Nadine Dorries hasn't delivered on her promise to stand down yet. And the Conservatives had another colossal majority in 2019 - winning this seat by 24,664. <br/>But both the main opposition parties think they're in with a chance. <br/>Labour finished second last time and the party is pledging to campaign aggressively in the constituency. Party strategists point to encouraging polling - and Sir Keir Starmer has put his trusted ally Peter Kyle in charge of the party's campaign in the seat. <br/>As one strategist puts it: \"We're all in.\"<br/>But the Lib Dems think they have a better chance in a rural seat, pointing to examples of recent victories in Tory heartlands. They argue old Conservative voters might be prepared to make a break from the Tories, but won't be prepared to make the switch to Labour. \"We've got real potential to win it\u2026 the best Labour can do is stop us winning,\" says one figure close to the campaign.<br/>This makes Mid Beds particularly interesting. In most recent by-elections, the challenger to a Conservative has been clear. This time both the main opposition parties are battling for that position. That could be good news for the Conservatives - if the vote is split it might allow the Tory candidate to hold the seat. <br/>But it might not. The constituency has one of the highest proportions of mortgage owners in England - an issue both opposition parties are keen to discuss. And equally safe Conservative seats have fallen in recent months. <br/>Finally, there's Tamworth. This is the seat held by Chris Pincher, the former Conservative whip who resigned from government amid sexual harassment allegations (Boris Johnson's handling of the issue helped bring down his government).<br/>Mr Pincher is still an MP but is now facing an eight-week Commons suspension after a report from Parliament's standards commissioner found he groped two people at a London club last year. The recommended sanction - if approved by MPs - would trigger a recall petition in his constituency, potentially leading to a by-election.<br/>Labour are already talking up their chances here - saying privately that they will throw the kitchen sink at trying to win it. <br/>The seat could have particular resonance, as one Labour figure points out. In 1996, a year before Tony Blair came to power, Labour won an old version of the seat (South East Staffordshire) - overturning a Conservative majority of 7,192 to win by a massive 13,762. The Conservative majority Labour would need to overturn this time is bigger (19,634) - but strategists think they're in with a shot. <br/>All of which brings us back to the start. There are a lot of factors are play in each seat. But it's possible the Conservatives could lose five seats in the next few months. <br/>The conclusion inside Tory HQ? \"They will all be extremely challenging.\"<br/>Voters in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, Somerton and Frome, and Selby and Ainsty constituencies will vote for a new MP on Thursday 20 July. <br/>Here's the list of the candidates standing:<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The Deposit Return Scheme has been sent for recycling.<br/>A ban on alcohol advertising has been scotched; Highly Protected Marine Areas have sunk beneath the waves.<br/>In quite a few of these cases, Mr Yousaf may have been left with little choice.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Five things to know about Scotland's new first minister Humza Yousaf<br/>Questions abounded over how the care service would work and be paid for; the recycling plans were beset with issues including a stand-off with the UK government. <br/>The no-fishing zones had prompted a backbench rebellion spearheaded by Ms Forbes and former minister Fergus Ewing, who acted out the fury of coastal communities by shredding a consultation document in the chamber.<br/>But Mr Yousaf will also feel he has acted decisively to rip up the more controversial items left in his in-tray by Ms Sturgeon. <br/>Comprehensive changes have been made to the government's agenda in a short space of time.<br/>He has also moved to reset a number of relationships with groups which felt neglected by the previous administration.<br/>The first was with business groups, in part via the reboot on alcohol advertising and recycling. There is talk of reforming business rates, and a \"new deal\" with the private sector.<br/>He also signed a new pact with local government which is known as the Verity House Agreement.<br/>Although there is always furious spin around the figures, councils have borne the brunt of budget cuts in recent years.<br/>Mr Yousaf has promised a new \"fiscal framework\" between town halls and the administration in Edinburgh, along with \"improved engagement on budgetary matters\".<br/>Fine words - but they will need to be backed up with hard cash if that relationship is to truly improve.<br/>Has Mr Yousaf also reset relations between the SNP and its leadership?<br/>He has certainly tried to run his government out of a bigger tent. <br/>Ms Sturgeon was famous for keeping a very tight circle of advisors who micromanaged most aspects of policy.<br/>Mr Yousaf meanwhile has actively sought to push decisions and responsibility out to his ministers.<br/>His initial policy prospectus featured each cabinet secretary outlining their goals and duties in their own words, introduced with the words \"I commit that by 2026, I will have...\".<br/>That may give them more autonomy to make decisions to deliver on these targets, but on the flip side it likely means they will have to carry the can for any issues in their portfolio.<br/>The departure of several of Ms Sturgeon's top team from government means there is now an assortment of big names with big views on the back benches - which range along a spectrum of loyalty.<br/>The likes of John Swinney can be relied upon for unswerving support, while Fergus Ewing has ranged off into almost outright rebellion.<br/>MSPs with views differing from those of the leadership tended to be quite shy about airing them publicly when Ms Sturgeon was in charge, but that is no longer the case.<br/>A broader debate over the SNP's core policy - independence - has also flourished under Mr Yousaf.<br/>He has sought to establish himself as the \"first activist\", getting out on the doorsteps regularly - but he also carried responsibility for setting the course of the main pro-independence party.<br/>Ms Sturgeon generally sought to keep the membership marching along to the beat of a strategy she herself had drawn up.<br/>By contrast, Mr Yousaf's big speech to the SNP's independence convention last month instead embraced just about every possible plan.<br/>There are elements within the party which variously favour a gradual build-up of support; continued efforts to secure a referendum; forcing the issue via an election result; and doubling down on public events like marches.<br/>Mr Yousaf's approach is to encourage all of them. Perhaps that will serve to keep them all happy for now, but he may need to swing firmly behind one particular strategy come the party's autumn conference - which unlike the convention is a decision-making event where members get a vote.<br/>Ms Sturgeon kept the SNP together as an election-winning machine by corralling pro-independence figures from right across the political spectrum behind one tightly-controlled central vision.<br/>It remains to be seen whether her successor's more relaxed approach encourages healthy debate - or furious infighting.<br/>Looking ahead, one thing Mr Yousaf has retained from the Sturgeon era is her deal with the Greens.<br/>That was underlined when he stood up in the chamber to defend Green minister Lorna Slater from a confidence vote tabled by the Tories.<br/>That may have helped smooth over the fact that several totems of the Bute House Agreement - like HMPAs - have been ditched.<br/>The Greens will also hope to wield influence from within the big tent as Mr Yousaf draws up his own policy plans.<br/>He will spend the summer recess preparing his own Programme for Government - the things he is actually doing, rather than cancelling.<br/>However, budgets remain tight. New finance secretary Shona Robison has already warned of a \u00a31bn shortfall next year, and that could double within four years.<br/>So he may need to be pragmatic and cut his cloth. There is already talk of a retreat from \"universalism\", in particular when it comes to free school meals in secondary schools.<br/>Beyond that, a September court date has been set for the first round of the showdown with the UK government over their move to block Holyrood's gender reforms.<br/>Whoever loses will likely appeal to the Inner House, and eventually to the Supreme Court, so an issue which the government had hoped to put to bed by passing reforms could well follow Mr Yousaf right up to the next set of elections.<br/>And there is the small matter of that SNP conference, where Mr Yousaf has promised to bring forward the results of a party governance review as well as a finalised independence strategy.<br/>Yousaf confirmed as Scotland's new first minister<br/>Who is Scotland's new first minister, Humza Yousaf?

But this is done by the independent Bank of England which the government does not control. <br/>When will we know? Inflation figures for the fourth quarter of 2023 will be published on 17 January 2024.<br/>Downing Street said Mr Sunak's pledge to \"grow the economy\" will be met if the economy is bigger in the fourth quarter of 2023 than in the previous three months.<br/>It is using GDP (or Gross Domestic Product), a measure of all the activity of companies, governments and individuals.<br/>This would not normally be seen as a difficult pledge, because the UK's economy is usually growing. The economy has got smaller in only four quarters in the past 10 years.<br/>But there has not been a lot of growth recently. In the last four quarters, GDP grew by 0.1% three times, and fell by 0.1% in the other quarter. The UK economy is still smaller than it was before the pandemic.<br/>Another problem for the government is that the pledge to grow the economy is made more difficult by its promise to halve inflation.<br/>The Bank of England has been putting up interest rates in an attempt to stop prices rising so quickly.<br/>The reason behind this is that higher interest rates can reduce the demand for things. However, this slows economic growth.<br/>When will we know? GDP for the fourth quarter of 2023 will be published on 13 February 2024.<br/>When governments talk about debt falling, they almost always mean as a proportion of GDP.<br/>The idea is that debt is falling if it is growing more slowly than the economy.<br/>But that has not been happening recently.<br/>The latest figures show that debt is above 100% of GDP for the first time since 1961.<br/>And if Mr Sunak does not manage to achieve his second priority of growing the economy, then getting debt to fall as a proportion of GDP becomes even harder.<br/>It is not clear what the deadline is for this pledge.<br/>In the Budget in March, the government claimed to be on track because the independent Office for Budget Responsibility - which checks the health of the economy - forecast that debt as a proportion of GDP would fall in 2027-28.<br/>That is in line with the government's existing rule that it should be on course for that to happen in five years' time.<br/>When will we know? The next update on forecasts for debt will accompany government plans for the economy, in its 2023 Autumn Statement. <br/>Mr Sunak said: \"NHS waiting lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly.\"<br/>His pledge only refers to waiting lists in England, because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland manage their own health systems.<br/>However, the overall number of patients waiting for treatment in England is still rising - from 7.33 million in March, to 7.42 million in April.<br/>Mr Sunak has claimed that he is cutting waiting lists, but that is only true of certain lists. <br/>The number of people waiting more than 18 months, for example, fell between February and March.<br/>We asked Downing Street when the prime minister aims to have waiting lists falling. <br/>It pointed us towards the plan for tackling the backlog of elective care (care planned in advance), which said the overall waiting list was expected to be falling by about March 2024.  <br/>The NHS target is to see people within 18 weeks for non-urgent consultant-led treatment.<br/>When will we know?: Waiting list figures are usually published on the second Thursday of each month. <br/>The final priority was to set out a plan to stop the small boats which bring people across the English Channel.<br/>The prime minister proposed to do that by passing a new law. The government's Illegal Migration Bill has passed through the House of Commons and is now in the House of Lords.<br/>Because the government has a big majority in the House of Commons, the bill is likely to be passed eventually.<br/>Mr Sunak has said that his plan to tackle small boat crossings is \"starting to work\".<br/>However, the bulk of arrivals usually turn up in the summer months so we will not know until later in the year whether or not his plan is working.<br/>When will we know? Figures on arrivals in small boats are collected daily. <br/>What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Around the world, governments that also oppose the popular technology are watching the showdown closely to see who will blink first.<br/>\"End-to-end encryption\", \"backdoors\" and \"client-side scanning\" - the biggest row in technology sounds very complicated.<br/>But really it comes down to a very simple question. Should technology companies be able to read people's messages?<br/>That is the crux of a row that has been brewing for years between Silicon Valley and the governments of at least a dozen countries around the world.<br/>WhatsApp, iMessage, Android Messages and Signal all use the super-secure system called end-to-end encryption.<br/>The technology means only the sender, at one end, and the receiver, at the other, can read messages, see media or hear phone calls. Even the app makers cannot access the content. <br/>In the past 10 years, end-to-end encrypted apps have become increasingly popular, with billions of people using them every day. <br/>Most governments and security agencies reluctantly accepted the technology's rise - until four years ago, when Mr Zuckerberg announced on stage the Messenger app and then Instagram would move to end-to-end encryption as standard. <br/>\"We're going to enable more than two billion people around the world to have their most personal conversations with each other privately,\" he said.<br/>Since then, Mr Zuckerberg and his army of engineers have slowly and quietly been cracking on with the project. The company is refusing to speak to reporters on the record about how the mammoth task is going or when the big switchover will be. \"By the end of 2023,\" is all it will say publicly.<br/>Meanwhile, the calls to stop the switchover or build in safeguards have been growing louder.<br/>Authorities in the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, India, Turkey, Japan and Brazil - plus law-enforcement agencies such as Interpol - have criticised the technology.<br/>But no government in the democratic world has risked passing a law that will interfere with these popular apps - until now.<br/>Making technology companies build in some sort of technical backdoor to allow messages to be scanned for illegal material is one of the central tenets of the UK's wide-reaching Online Safety Bill, which looks likely to be passed into law in the near future.<br/>Police officers, if they can no longer ask Meta for the contents of people's messages, will miss out on a key source of evidence they regularly use to convict criminals or terrorists, the government says. <br/>And there is a particular concern about children being groomed online in secret.<br/>End-to-end encryption \"will be a huge boon to anyone who wants to hurt a child\", Home Secretary Suella Braverman wrote to Mr Zuckerberg on Monday.<br/>And on Wednesday, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has released a YouGov survey it commissioned, suggesting the British public wants police officers to be able to access people's messages, to protect children. <br/>Of the 1,723 adults surveyed across the UK, 73% said technology companies should, by law, have to scan private messaging for child sexual abuse and disrupt it in end-to-end encrypted environments.<br/>Most already scanned for child sexual abuse on their services, leading to many successful convictions, the NSPCC said.<br/>\"It is now clear that companies who wish to pit children's fundamental right to safety against the privacy rights of adults are out of step with the public and, ultimately, their user base,\" Richard Collard, at the charity, said.<br/>In response to the survey, a Meta spokesman said the company had \"developed safety measures that prevent, detect and allow us to take action against this heinous abuse\" - age restrictions for contacting strangers, for example.<br/>Also on Wednesday, as if to highlight the passions on both sides of the debate, 68 prominent security and privacy researchers have published a letter saying the Online Safety Bill would effectively break end-to-end encryption.<br/>The bill puts the onus on tech firms to find a way to implement child safety measures whilst maintaining privacy for users but the experts say this is impossible. <br/>\"Our concern is that surveillance technologies are deployed in the spirit of providing online safety,\" the letter says.<br/>\"This act undermines privacy guarantees and, indeed, safety online.\"<br/>It also sets a precedent for repressive regimes around the world to monitor and control what people are sharing, experts say.<br/>WhatsApp and Signal, meanwhile, have said they would rather remove their services from the UK than degrade end-to-end encryption security.  <br/>And to make matters worse for critics of the technology, Elon Musk announced, in May, he too was building end to end encryption, into Twitter messages.<br/>Switching to the technology is complex and expensive, as evidenced by Meta, but ultimately worth it tech bosses think.<br/>After years of data scandals, big tech sees it as key to rebuilding trust in its services.<br/>And in a happy coincidence, end-to-end encryption makes these embattled companies' tricky job of moderation a lot easier - if they cannot see what users are sharing, then neither can they police it.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Three former offenders who have turned their lives around delivered some home truths to the peers this week.<br/>\"You can't tell someone to stop having a drink, if you have never had a drink. The problem is there are a lot of people in probation who have not been drug dealers, have never been in front of a magistrate.\"<br/>DeQeon credits the transformation that has taken place in his life to a probation officer, a woman he describes as his \"guardian angel\", who saw potential in him and went the extra mile to help him realise it.<br/>\"My other probation officers after Louise were not as good. I feel like a lot of them had no life experience. They are academics, they have not been in the real world,\" he told the committee.<br/>They had a \"tick box\" mentality, he explained, and did not \"get\" the challenges someone from a tough background like his faced. <br/>It was a message echoed by Caroline and Ayesha, who were also giving evidence about their experiences of the probation service.<br/>DeQeon told the peers: \"People like me need to be in probation because it would change the system. It would make the system a lot better. We wouldn't be sitting here talking about the situation if there was people like us being probation officers.\"<br/>But why stop at the probation service?<br/>\"Not a lot of people sitting on this panel have been on the other side of the system, have they?\" asked DeQeon. <br/>\"The problem is that if we had, we wouldn't be here,\" replied Labour peer and former Home Secretary Lord Blunkett.<br/>\"You could be... you've got to have life experience!\" DeQeon responded.<br/>The three witnesses had all served community sentences, where low-level offenders are ordered to do unpaid work and have drug, alcohol or mental health treatment instead of going to prison.<br/>They are now \"lived experience\" advisers with charity Revolving Doors, which campaigns for more community sentences and an end to prison sentences of 12 months or less in England and Wales, like in Scotland.<br/>The probation service - which has struggled with its workload in recent months - is key to making community sentences work.<br/>Last month, Kim Thornden-Edwards, head of the service in England, told the Lords committee new investment going into alcohol and drug treatment programmes was a potential \"game changer\". <br/>She also acknowledged problems with pre-sentence reports - the all-important advice given to judges and magistrates on how to deal with offenders. A new, simpler form was about to be rolled out, she told the peers. Individually-tailored treatment orders were also coming down the track, she said.<br/>The three former offenders told the committee pre-sentence reports were often out of date and did not have any input from the offenders themselves - and that some of the court-ordered programmes did not make a lot of sense.<br/>Ayesha, a recovering addict, suggested drug treatment orders should be dropped in favour of a more \"holistic\" approach. She said she had gone into a treatment centre only after her community sentence had ended, with little input from probation. <br/>She also spoke movingly of her ambition to go to university to study criminology, and her fear that despite all her efforts her criminal record would still be held against her.<br/>The Ministry of Justice says it is keen to set an example to other employers when it comes to giving a chance to ex-offenders. <br/>A spokesperson said: \"We know finding work is one of the surest ways for prison leavers to stay on the straight and narrow, which is why our Going Forward into Employment (GFIE) scheme provides employment opportunities for ex-offenders - helping to cut crime and protect the public.\"<br/>People with criminal records can apply for jobs with the probation service - and the wider Ministry of Justice - through the GFIE scheme.<br/>But the scheme does not include the role of probation officer.<br/>There is nothing to stop people with criminal convictions applying to be a probation officer \"in the usual way\", the MoJ says, and having a conviction will not necessarily count against them.<br/>But those with experience of the system say they will face a lengthy vetting process and there is no record of how many ex-offenders, if any, have ever been successful.<br/>Some ex-offenders work as volunteer \"peer mentors\", using their own experience of the criminal justice system to offer guidance and support to those struggling to cope with it.<br/>Caroline, who overcame problems with alcohol and mental health, told the Lords committee about her work with the NHS Liaison and Diversion service, which supports vulnerable people when they first come into contact with the criminal justice system.<br/>She said she was keen to work for the probation service in a similar role.<br/>\"However, due to my criminal record I have been pushed back several times. And it's so frustrating because I have come such a long, long way, but because of something that happened years ago when I wasn't very well, they are like 'nah'.

He was adopted by Eric Blair - better known by his pen name of George Orwell. <br/>Orwell's novel 1984 was the origin of the popular understanding of \"Big Brother\" and \"Room 101\".<br/>Mr Blair told BBC Politics East: \"He would have thought, what's changed?\" <br/>Mr Blair spoke as a new biography on Orwell by Norwich writer and novelist DJ Taylor was published.<br/>With Russia calling the war in Ukraine a \"special military operation\" and with many supporters of former US president Donald Trump believing his falsehood that he won the last election, many people see 1984 as more relevant than ever, Mr Taylor said.<br/>Asked about how his father would react if he came back today, Mr Blair said: \"Has it changed from the world of 1984 and Animal Farm? It's been the same for a millennia. I suppose it will be the same in another 100 years' time.<br/>\"He would have a certain sense of deja vu. He would have thought, what's changed?\" <br/>He added: \"My father was a great patriot. A great defender of his country and he was also a critic of both sides of the political debate. He would criticise both left and right.\" <br/>Prof Jean Seaton, official historian of the BBC, said Orwell was still incredibly important.<br/>\"We live in a world with surveillance, facial recognition. 1984 is about the capacity of authoritarian regimes like Russia, China, to make you believe what is not true,\" she said.<br/>Mr Blair spoke as a new biography on Orwell by Norwich writer and novelist DJ Taylor was published.<br/>An award-winning writer and critic, Mr Taylor's new biography \"Orwell: The New Life\" is the first to reveal insights about Orwell from newly uncovered letters to Eleanor Collings and Brenda Salkend, who had become part of his life when he lived in Southwold, Suffolk.<br/>\"These two caches of new material, letters he'd written to Suffolk girlfriends in the 1930s, don't just tell us about the relationship with the two women, they tell us about all kinds of things,\" said Mr Taylor.<br/>\"They tell us about what he was reading, his politics and where he was, geographical information.\"<br/>He added: \"In terms of improving our understanding of Orwell's work, I suspect his letters to Eleanor reminiscing about their country walks at Southwold may have inspired similar passages describing Winston's affair with Julia in 1984.\"<br/>While in Southwold, Orwell wrote the 1935 novel A Clergyman's Daughter, which is set in a fictionalised version of the town.<br/>Mr Taylor said: \"I think Southwold and its ambience and its values were an awful lot of the things Orwell felt he was rebelling against.<br/>\"On the other side, he had a very traditional nature. Somebody said of him, he was a conservative in everything but politics.<br/>\"I have a feeling there were certain aspects of Southwold he found very congenial.\"<br/>The newly discovered letters were bought by Mr Blair and donated to the Orwell Archive at University College London.<br/>Mr Blair said: \"I thought I better make an offer to secure the letters for posterity.<br/>\"I was interested that my father maintained his correspondence with Brenda Salkend for a great number of years. He always seemed to hold out a candle for all his girlfriends, certainly these two, as far as I can see.\"<br/>BBC Politics East will broadcast on Sunday, 2 July at 10:00 BST on BBC One andavailable after broadcast on BBC iPlayer.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

That decision could itself be challenged at the Supreme Court.<br/>The five-year trial - announced in April 2022 - would see some asylum seekers sent to Rwanda on a one-way ticket, to claim asylum there.<br/>They may be granted refugee status to stay in Rwanda. If not, they can apply to settle there on other grounds, or seek asylum in another \"safe third country\". <br/>The government says the plan will deter people arriving in the UK through \"illegal, dangerous or unnecessary methods\", such as on small boats which cross the English Channel.  <br/>More than 45,700 people used this route to come to the UK in 2022, the highest figure since records began.<br/>Small-boat crossings decreased slightly in the first few months of 2023 but numbers could rise again in the summer. <br/>No asylum seeker has actually been sent to Rwanda so far. The first flight was scheduled to go in June 2022, but was cancelled after legal challenges.<br/>In June 2023, the Court of Appeal overturned an earlier ruling by the High Court that the Rwanda plan was lawful.<br/>The judges ruled that the east African nation is not a safe third country because of \"deficiencies\" in its asylum system which mean that some claimants could be sent back to their home countries, where they might face persecution. <br/>It said that \"unless and until\" those deficiencies are corrected, removal of asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlawful.<br/>The ruling also said that the Rwanda policy breaches Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and inhuman treatment. <br/>It was not a unanimous decision. Two judges agreed to reverse the High Court decision but a third did not. <br/>The judges said their decision does not imply a view about the \"political merits\" of the policy. <br/>Asylum Aid, the charity which brought the case against the government, said the judgement was a \"vindication of the importance of the rule of law and basic fairness when fundamental rights are at stake\". <br/>The UN's refugee agency, which advised the court on matters of international refugee law during the appeal, also welcomed the ruling, and urged the UK government to \"pursue other measures\" instead.<br/>But Home Secretary Suella Braverman called the judgment \"disappointing\", and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak confirmed the government will seek permission to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.<br/>While legal proceedings continue, flights still cannot take off for Rwanda. <br/>The UK government previously said \"anyone entering the UK illegally\" after 1 January 2022 could be sent, with no limit on numbers.<br/>Rwanda says it can process 1,000 asylum seekers during the trial period, but has capacity for more. <br/>Under the deal, Rwanda can also ask the UK to take in some of its most vulnerable refugees.  <br/>But in October 2022, Privilege Style - the airline which was scheduled to take asylum seekers to Rwanda - withdrew from its Home Office contract, after a campaign by refugee charities. <br/>At the time the Guardian reported that two other airlines which had previously conducted deportation flights had also ruled out participation in the Rwanda scheme. <br/>So far the UK has paid the Rwandan government \u00a3140m for the scheme but it has not provided an overall cost. <br/>An economic-impact assessment prepared for the government's Illegal Migration Bill estimated that removing each individual to a third country, such as Rwanda, would cost \u00a363,000 more than keeping them in the UK. <br/>That figure is the difference between the total cost of removing an individual - estimated to be \u00a3169,000 - and the \u00a3106,000 spent on housing support if they remain in the UK.<br/>The \u00a3169,000 total includes a payment to the third country of around \u00a3105,000 per person, as well as \u00a322,000 for flights.<br/>The Home Office said no cost would be incurred if the policy deterred an individual from entering the UK illegally. <br/>But it said it was \"uncertain\" how many people would be deterred because the policy was \"novel and untested\".<br/>The UK's asylum system costs \u00a33bn a year. Almost \u00a37m a day is spent on hotel accommodation for refugees and asylum seekers. <br/>Critics say the daily cost is so high because of the time taken to decide on applications, and a ban on asylum seekers working while waiting for confirmation of their status.<br/>The UN Refugee Agency defines an asylum seeker as someone who has applied for shelter and protection in another country. <br/>A refugee is a person who has fled conflict or persecution in their own country. <br/>The legal rights of refugees are protected by international law. However, it is up to host countries to decide whether an asylum seeker is granted refugee status. <br/>In 2022, the UK received more than 89,000 asylum applications, the highest number for 20 years. Of these, more than 23,800 people and their dependants were granted a form of protection. <br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

If people spend less in businesses, what does that mean for jobs? If people end up out of work, what does that mean for the government's welfare bill? And, therefore, for that third priority of the prime minister's: reducing national debt.  <br/>The increased cost of borrowing from high interest rates can also disincentivise investment in business, which can also lead to lower economic growth. <br/>The tricky balancing act between inflation and recession is getting worse.<br/>So what is in the government's power?<br/>One quick lever the government can pull is taxes. <br/>Raising taxes is another way to stop groups of people from spending more. <br/>But that's an unpalatable political choice too. <br/>Mr Sunak has previously made it clear, and pledged in the past, that he wants to cut - not raise - taxes before the next election. <br/>Some Tory MPs have been repeatedly calling for tax cuts. <br/>Governments can also reduce spending. <br/>While we do hear ministers talk about making \"efficiencies\", departments talking about making cuts is - again - an unpalatable narrative ahead of an election. <br/>Mr Sunak has said, for now, that he wants to make sure government is \"responsible\" with borrowing. <br/>Another quick lever would be price controls - the government setting limits on price increases. <br/>Mr Sunak says ministers are \"looking at\" supermarkets to make sure they are behaving responsibly, for example. <br/>But Number 10 have been clear they are not introducing price caps and any such schemes would be at retailers' discretion. <br/>The governor of the Bank of England has suggested workers shouldn't ask for excessive pay rises. <br/>The government has also been very reluctant to hike public sector wages, especially if funded by more borrowing. <br/>Both argue giving people more money in their pockets could fuel inflation: if people's wages keep up with rising prices, they can buy the same things, so demand (and prices) remain similar. <br/>In blunter terms - their strategy of reducing inflation by reducing demand means people need to be able to afford less.  <br/>This argument has led to strikes in multiple sectors, with unions arguing this is unfair for workers. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Sunak makes five pledges on the NHS, economy and migrants<br/>This is also a tricky balancing act here for the economy. <br/>If people can afford less: what does that mean for growing the economy? And jobs? <br/>Potentially putting people out of work has a government price tag too. <br/>So what about pushing supply up, rather than demand down, to lower prices? <br/>Supply-side reforms are, in simple terms, decisions that could make industries more productive to increase the supply of goods and services - and grow the economy too. <br/>Free-market examples include things like cutting business taxes, regulation, red tape, or even certain worker protections or welfare benefits. Or increasing migration for certain sectors. <br/>State-intervention examples could be building more houses, investing in infrastructure, or investing in homegrown energy supplies like nuclear power or renewables.  <br/>Clearly, any of these involve political choices too. <br/>But they also take time to come into effect. <br/>The government - and Labour - have ruled out direct support to help people with mortgages, saying this would fuel inflation - and instead point to existing benefits for the most vulnerable.<br/>Ministers are continuing to point to interest rates as the solution, though most are reluctant to admit that involves a lot of pain for it to work. <br/>It's important to remember when the government says it can't do something that what they're usually referring to is a choice. <br/>Each choice comes with its own shade of political thorniness, and potentially means trading the prime minister's priorities off against each other.<br/>UK inflation shock: This is really grim<br/>Why is UK inflation so high?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

As the party in government, the Conservatives bear the most responsibility for this.<br/>The Greens aren't entirely off the hook, though. Their decisions to oppose some solar farms shape our energy system, and give the impression that local objections have more weight than national missions.<br/>Frank Adlington-Stringer is one Green councillor who has opposed a solar farm in the past.<br/>In 2021, before he was elected to North East Derbyshire Council, Mr Adlington-Stringer wrote an article explaining why he could not support a solar farm in the county.<br/>He said \"the loss of green space\" and the restriction of \"already limited habitats\" were among his main concerns.<br/>In the end, the application was rejected by government planning inspectors. At the time, one local Green councillor said \"younger generations are very concerned about the effects of climate change, and might see things differently\".<br/>In this case, at least, Mr Adlington-Stringer, 25, did not. He says while he is open to solar farms, he believes such projects should not be a \"priority\".<br/>\"We shouldn't be exchanging green energy for green spaces,\" he says.<br/>Julia Hilton is another Green councillor who campaigned against a solar farm in Hastings, before she was elected in 2021.<br/>Although it didn't have any councillors at the time, the local Green Party rallied against proposed solar panels within agricultural fields in Hastings Country Park.<br/>The Labour-led council then abandoned the project after the government's environmental adviser, Natural England, said the scheme \"would result in significant landscape and visual impacts\".<br/>The label of NIMBY - an acronym for \"not in my backyard\" - is sometimes applied to those do not want something visually unappealing to be built near their home.<br/>Ms Hilton, now the Green group leader on Hastings Borough Council, bristles at the suggestion of the \"NIMBY argument\" in these circumstances.<br/>The proposed site, she says, was \"not compatible with a solar farm, which would industrialise this very precious landscape habitat\".<br/>Whatever the merits of individual solar proposals, the optics of Green politicians objecting to renewable energy have thrown up awkward questions for the party's leadership.<br/>Green Party of England and Wales co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, insists Greens \"see an important role for solar farms as part of the mix\".<br/>\"It's not about being ideological,\" he tells the BBC. \"The [solar] application has to be considered on its merits.\"<br/>He denies solar farms are a political problem for his party, and says there are Greens supporting them in Oxfordshire, Lancaster and Kent.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It's a plea we hear a lot from the Green Party, which has been campaigning to make solar panels mandatory on the roofs of all suitable new homes.<br/>But will rooftops alone really fill our solar-shaped hole?<br/>Simon Evans, the deputy editor of Carbon Brief, says \"restricting cheap, utility-scale solar\" would make the challenge of net zero \"even more difficult\".<br/>The government's energy security strategy talks of expanding UK solar capacity to 70GW by 2035. \"It would not be possible to build that much solar capacity on the UK's rooftops,\" Mr Evans says.<br/>In a report, the government's climate adviser estimated a maximum potential of 37GW on rooftops. \"Even if it were possible to reach 70GW of solar on the UK's rooftops, it would be significantly more expensive to do so,\" Mr Evans says.<br/>This kind of assessment has not stopped some Greens and other parties standing in the way of solar farms in Suffolk.<br/>Earlier this year, two Green councillors sided with four Tories on Mid-Suffolk Council to block a solar farm near Somersham. And on the Suffolk-Cambridgeshire border, a plan to build one of Europe's largest solar farms - with the potential to power 172,000 homes - has been met with fierce resistance.<br/>Andrew Stringer - the first Green district councillor to be elected in Suffolk in 2003 - says the proposed Sunnica Energy Farm is a \"symptom of a wider problem\".<br/>He blames the Conservatives for failing to legislate to put more solar on roofs. A solar farm has to \"make sense\", he says, adding if it doesn't, and a Green councillor can't reconcile their opposition with their party's national policy, \"we embrace that\".<br/>\"It's called democracy,\" he says.<br/>Democracy served the party well in May's local elections, with the Greens making records gains, notably in some rural areas with a history of voting Conservative. This pivot to the countryside has expanded the party's base beyond its core voters in urban areas.<br/>The party has built \"a potentially unstable coalition, requiring some degree of hypocrisy, like their NIMBY stance\", said Dr James Dennison, a political scientist.<br/>On solar farms, the Greens \"are in danger of letting this narrative of hypocrisy spread and more so than for other parties given their environmental ideology,\" said Dr James Dennison, an expert on the party.<br/>\"This would hurt their national performance more than local.\"<br/>As the Greens seek to add parliamentary seats to their council ones, is there a temptation to a focus on wooing the type of rural voters who dislike the idea of solar farms?<br/>\"We put across our values for the local elections just gone and people came behind them very strongly, including in Suffolk and many rural areas around the country,\" says Mr Ramsay, who's eyeing up a seat in the Suffolk countryside.<br/>\"It will be the same at the general election.\"<br/>How UK Greens are learning from overseas allies<br/>Too late to save planet, says Green Party founder<br/>Labour hints at solar panel policy for new builds<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

We were disrespected and manipulated.\" <br/>Like Ms Msezane, he was recruited last year by an agent in his home country via an advertisement on social media, and had to pay for his own airfare and visa before being put to work on fruit farms in the south of England.<br/>Ms Msezane, who is from Johannesburg, is now a care worker for an English local authority.<br/>She told the BBC she was treated with respect in her new role, in sharp contrast to her experience last year as a seasonal agricultural worker, picking and packing strawberries for British supermarkets.<br/>\"I could not have thought that the conditions I found in 2022, in the United Kingdom, were what I found. It was beyond shocking.<br/>\"I'd spent close to, almost, \u00a32,500 equivalent. There is no way I am going home at that point. I am here to make money. That's essentially it. So you get to work.\"<br/>She had to pay rent to live in a caravan with six people of different nationalities, both men and women, who had a single shower and fridge between them.<br/>\"My country is going through a lot economically. People need work. So I would never say to people not to come on the seasonal worker visa,\" she told the BBC.<br/>\"Everyone who was on the scheme with me was able to support their families in different ways.\"<br/>But she added: \"You need to be aware that you are coming into a country where you don't have as many rights as a worker as you do in South Africa. So that can be challenging.\"<br/>Vadim Sardov, from Kazakhstan, said conditions on his farm were so bad several people had decided to leave and work illegally instead.<br/>Seasonal workers were not asking for \"five star hotels\", he told the committee, but \"employers must provide proper living and working conditions\".<br/>Emiliano Mellino, a journalist for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, who has written a series of articles on the treatment of migrant workers, told the Lords committee some workers had been subjected to bullying and abuse.<br/>He said many take out loans to cover the costs of coming to the UK, and they also had to pay rent of up to \u00a380 a week for their accommodation, which meant they were reluctant to speak out for fear of losing their job.<br/>The government's official policy is to train British workers to fill the 50,000 seasonal jobs on British farms currently carried out by migrant workers.<br/>Before the UK left EU, most of these casual workers came from Europe.<br/>When the current seasonal workers visa scheme was launched in 2019, it had a quota of just 2,500 places a year, with most coming from Russia and Ukraine.<br/>It was expanded to 38,000 visas in 2022, following pressure from the farming industry, who had been forced to leave crops unpicked.<br/>The net was cast to a wider range of nationalities, including South Africa and central Asian countries like Kazakhstan.<br/>The scheme is due to run until 2024, with debate raging in government over whether it should be expanded to keep food costs down and help tame inflation.<br/>The government has authorised only a small number of recruitment companies, known as \"scheme operators\", to arrange seasonal worker visas. <br/>Farmers must hire their overseas workers through those companies and must demonstrate that they are actively trying to recruit UK-based workers as well. <br/>Scheme operators also have explicit duties to look after workers' welfare and make sure they are paid properly.<br/>At an earlier committee hearing, in April this year, farmer Mike Newey said it was a \"myth\" that seasonal fruit picking was a low skilled, poorly paid job with bad accommodation.<br/>\"Our seasonal workers are paid a minimum of \u00a310.42, the national living wage, and often earn \u00a315 to \u00a320 an hour when they are on piece-work rates. It is good pay. They have subsidised accommodation on the farm.\"<br/>He added: \"We should be proud of giving people from other countries a leg up. That is what we are doing.\"<br/>Ali Capper, of the West Sussex Growers' Association, said: \"To have staff, we need to accommodate them, and ensure their welfare and that they are very well looked after.\"<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

He stresses that he's as dedicated to independence as anyone in the SNP, but he believes that patience is required.<br/>He's urged fellow members to focus on convincing more undecided voters to support independence, which he believes will create \"overwhelming\" pressure on the UK government to grant a second referendum.<br/>But others feel another referendum won't happen, and that brings us to option two. This involves using elections to secure independence.<br/>It's a tactic that's gained prominence in SNP circles in recent years. <br/>Towards the end of her leadership, Nicola Sturgeon floated the idea of running an election as a \"de facto\" referendum.<br/>The concept is fairly simple: the SNP would contest an election (or elections) insisting that a vote for them is a vote for independence. This could be stated in the opening line of a manifesto.<br/>Ash Regan, who ran to replace Nicola Sturgeon earlier this year, backs this approach.<br/>She believes the SNP could even team up with other pro-independence parties, meaning that more than 50% of the vote combined would lead to independence.<br/>She thinks it's time to move away from relying on the referendum path, saying \"we've been thinking of it as the gold standard, but in fact it's the ballot box that's the gold standard route\".<br/>But there are potential weaknesses with this option.<br/>Why would the UK government agree to this? Would the international community recognise it? <br/>Most advocates of such a Plan B feel that Westminster intransigence on a second referendum means that a radical alternative is needed.<br/>But others fear it won't deliver independence and would alienate the middle-ground of Scottish politics.<br/>Option three involves taking to the streets - mass demonstrations calling for independence. <br/>Perhaps this option should be seen as complementing others, rather than being a route to independence in itself. <br/>The cross-party All Under One Banner movement will march from Stirling to Bannockburn at the very same time the SNP gathers in Dundee.<br/>As a party member, Patrick McCarthy could have attended the convention. But he worries the SNP is simply \"talking to themselves\" . <br/>He'll be \"speaking to the mass movement\" by organising the march instead.<br/>He says \"the hearts and minds and belief in independence is the thing that's going to get us over the line\".<br/>The first minister will set out his preferred route to independence at Saturday's convention.<br/>Humza Yousaf wants to drive up overall support, but he's also said that elections must be used to advance the cause of independence.<br/>This convention won't rubber-stamp any strategy. That would have to come at the SNP's autumn conference.<br/>There are political risks for Humza Yousaf in this weekend's convention.<br/>It could highlight splits within his party. And it exposes him to accusations that he's prioritising the constitution over day-to-day problems.<br/>But, given that independence is his party's fundamental aim, it's important for him to show party members that he's formulating a plan to achieve the ultimate goal.<br/>The SNP may emerge closer to defining their strategy on independence, but making that a reality feels a harder task for the party right now.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Two years before the Brexit referendum, Clacton-on-Sea saw its MP defect to Brexit-supporting UKIP. How do people in the resort feel about it all now?<br/>The Tendring area of Essex - which includes the seaside town of Clacton - recorded one of the highest leave votes in England in the 2016 referendum. Almost 70% of people voted out - and turnout was 74.5%.<br/>Clacton was considered by many to be the beating heart of Brexit after its Conservative MP Douglas Carswell defected to UKIP in 2014. In 2015, 22 UKIP councillors were elected on to the district council.<br/>But what do people in the resort feel about Brexit today?<br/>\"I voted to leave, but I wish I hadn't,\" says Clacton resident Jill Ayling, 76. <br/>\"We didn't know the whole truth, did we? We were supposed to get money for the National Health Service, but to my mind it hasn't happened.  <br/>\"If I had to vote again, I'd vote to stay.\"<br/>She believes people were swayed by the political arguments at the time but it will have a lasting effect on younger generations. <br/>\"For younger people, it has altered dramatically for them. Things have changed,\" she says.<br/>Billy Ball, 42, the managing director of Clacton Pier, did not want to reveal how he voted in the 2016 referendum.<br/>\"The biggest challenge for hospitality and the seaside as a whole - and Clacton Pier - has been how the Eastern European labour took the decision to move home,\" he says.<br/>\"We've never really recovered from that. The British don't see hospitality as a long-term career path.<br/>\"It is an older demographic in Clacton and perhaps there's some idealism, with people thinking standing on our own two feet was a good thing. <br/>\"We were one of the country's only UKIP areas but it was probably all a bit of a flash in the pan. <br/>\"People tend to have forgotten why the resulting problems exist.\" <br/>Jason Smedley, 53, has lived in Clacton for 15 years and owns a number of businesses, including the Royal Hotel.<br/>He did not vote in the referendum.<br/>\"In all of my businesses, I can't see any difference,\" he says. \"Covid is the only thing that's had an impact here and around the country.\"<br/>He says he took the strong Brexit sentiment in Clacton with \"a pinch of salt\".<br/>\"I had a look at the main points and how it would affect me as a business and thought - actually, it doesn't - either way,\" he says.<br/>\"I was waiting to see this catastrophic failure of everything in the country.\"<br/>His view is echoed by the hotel's general manager, Victoria Hart. The 23-year-old was too young to vote in the 2016 ballot. <br/>\"It hasn't affected us at all,\" she says, \"especially people my age and my friends here in Clacton, we don't talk about it. <br/>\"Covid is the only thing that has severely impacted my life.\" <br/>Ryan Richards, 22, says he feels \"left out\" as he too was unable to vote in the referendum.<br/>\"We should have stayed with the EU,\" he says. <br/>\"With the trade routes and the way prices are going up now, it's becoming impossible for people my age even to get a home, let alone anything else - I blame Brexit for that.<br/>\"When it all happened we were under the age - I couldn't vote. <br/>\"I can understand why they want to make their their own trade routes without having to rely on someone, but they should have at least gone to young people, who are going or be majorly affected by it all. <br/>\"I feel left out.\"<br/>\"I don't think you can tell if it has worked, because of the pandemic and the trouble we've had with the government keeping changing, there hasn't been a time when you can say there's been a smooth period,\" says Ronald Oudnie.<br/>The 74-year-old voted for Brexit.<br/>\"You've got to wait until you've got a government that's been in for a few years, that it's been stable and able to sort things out.   <br/>\"I can remember when we actually joined the EU. We didn't sign up to a lot of things then that they brought in after, it was more like an economic thing. <br/>\"But they implemented laws on us when we should be implementing our own laws, it's as simple as that.\"<br/>Peter Lenard, 79, voted to stay in the EU.<br/>\"It's been a disaster, Brexit,\" he says.<br/>\"We were all promised we were going to put so much money into the NHS and I honestly think if you were to ask a lot of people today who voted out, I think a lot would change their mind.\"<br/>He says there is an element of \"I told you so\".  <br/>\"All my friends say the same,\" he says.<br/>\"I voted out because of Brussels, I was fed up of having to answer to them for every single thing, no for any other reason,\" says Beverley Banks.   <br/>\"I was hoping a lot of Europe was going to do the same and then we could form again and do it differently. <br/>\"It didn't happen. The Ukraine war didn't help, but everything is so much more expensive.\"<br/>Her friend Rosalie Pope says: \"I knew it was a bad idea, and it was.<br/>\"I travel internationally for business all the time and didn't want the rigmarole - so I voted 'in'.\" <br/>Small business owner Neil Stock, 55, is a former Conservative leader of Tendring District Council. <br/>\"How you judge whether that's been a success or a failure, or good or bad, or wrong or right, is down to your own independent view of the world,\" he says. <br/>\"If you were going to and from Europe on a regular basis I should imagine it's been quite irksome. <br/>\"But for most people it hasn't even touched the sides. I don't regret voting leave at all. If you reran the referendum, despite the opinion polls you'd get a very similar result. <br/>\"People who never vote came out and wielded the pencil in the ballot box and said 'I want to leave'. The decision was made on a whole raft of emotions, including sovereignty.<br/>\"We live in a post-Brexit world. It doesn't mean the world ended in 2016.\"<br/>The government has previously said it was \"making the most of Brexit freedoms\".<br/>\"The government is making the most of our Brexit freedoms to grow the economy, including ambitious financial services sector reforms which will unlock over \u00a3100bn of investment, and we are reviewing EU-derived rules in other critical growth sectors this year,\" said a spokesperson.<br/>Question Time is hosting a special debate from Clacton on BBC One from 22:40 BST.<br/>Photography by Martin Giles<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

But inflation in the UK has climbed faster and been more stubborn than in the US and EU.  <br/>Some, including Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, claim Brexit may be to blame. But it's a complex picture.<br/>Singling out the impact of Brexit isn't easy, especially with the effects of a pandemic and a war. But there is evidence that the red tape - the form filling and other hurdles - required to bring goods into the country may have added to food bills. <br/>More than a quarter of our food is imported from the EU. <br/>Researchers at the London School of Economics (LSE) compared how the prices of some of those items rose compared with those of food from elsewhere. The differences may reflect other factors, and may not be purely down to Brexit. <br/>But the academics claimed that if they were, then the extra red tape could have added \u00a3250 in total to the typical household's grocery shopping bills between December 2019 and March 2023, with meat and cheese particularly affected.<br/>Most of that rise - about \u00a3210 - they say came through before our current cost-of-living crunch, in 2020 and 2021, as businesses were preparing and first implementing the new processes. <br/>But in total, the LSE team reckons the changes could have accounted for over a quarter of the rise in food bills we've seen since the end of 2019. By contrast, the cost savings in new trade deals agreed since then have been minimal.<br/>So while Brexit may not have been the biggest reason for our surging food inflation, the higher costs it added may have played a significant part.<br/>But here's a small crumb of comfort - even with these changes, academics at Oxford Economics believe food is 7% cheaper in the UK than on average in the EU. <br/>And official statistics show a smaller part of spending in the UK goes on food - less than \u00a31 in every \u00a38 - than in France or Germany.<br/>However, a trip to the butchers, deli counter or nipping out for a pizza could become still more expensive.  <br/>The remainder of post-Brexit import checks and formalities on items brought into the UK to guard against risks to animal health and food fraud are due to be phased in from October, after they were postponed during the pandemic. <br/>The government has streamlined several processes in the meantime, considerably reducing the extra bills importers were due to face.<br/>But meat, dairy or fish products, for example, will have to be signed off as safe by a vet before entry, at a cost of hundreds of euros. <br/>Every consignment of goods in such medium- and high-risk categories entering the UK will face a new charge at border posts of up to \u00a343. <br/>The changes will cost businesses hundreds of millions of pounds per year. And customers may ultimately foot the bill.<br/>Meanwhile, the end of free movement means 330,000 fewer workers in the UK, according to one estimate from economists at the Centre for European Reform. <br/>That is 1% of the workforce, but it is hitting some sectors harder than others - transport, hospitality and retail are all seeing more acute staff shortages. <br/>Such employers tend to have to offer larger pay rises to attract and keep staff. While that is good news for those in work, who might have scored a bigger pay rise than they would have done otherwise, those costs are often passed on to customers. <br/>Then there is a less visible possible impact. Investment - in things like equipment, skills and IT - has stalled since the referendum. <br/>Economists, including those at the government's own independent forecasters, say part of that gap may reflect Brexit-related costs or uncertainty. That makes the UK less efficient than it could be, meaning the cost of producing stuff is higher.  <br/>But with the Windsor Framework settling the arrangements for trading with the EU between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, economists hope some uncertainty has disappeared, and investment may get a boost. But that takes time. <br/>The current inflation shock is truly global. But those escalating bills in the UK may come with a Brexit surcharge on top - just when households and businesses feel they can least cope. <br/>Bread to loo roll: UK prices compared to Europe<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

However, food inflation in Germany, Sweden and Portugal has fallen significantly since March - while the figure for the UK has remained stubbornly high.<br/>In fact, the UK's food inflation in April was higher than the European Union average of 16.4% and higher than all the major European economies.<br/>It was exceeded by Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia and Hungary.<br/>BBC Verify asked Mr Stride's department which figures he was referring to. We we were told he was talking about the first three months of 2023, when UK food price inflation was 18% and Sweden, Germany and Portugal were all over 20%.<br/>The reason UK food inflation is so high has been the focus of a recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) analysis. The ONS is responsible for calculating the UK's inflation figures.<br/>It identified three main reasons behind the price rises:<br/>The good news is that global wholesale food prices (that's the amount producers charge for their produce) have been falling. However, it generally takes time for that to feed through to supermarket prices, so customers have to wait before their bills stop rising.<br/>The ONS says one reason the UK's prices have been rising faster for longer could be down to a reliance on food imports. This suggests European countries that grow more of their own food have seen smaller food prices increases.<br/>The next set of UK inflation figures - covering the year to May - will be published on Wednesday.<br/>Read more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Hemlock, however, is far from our only green neighbour that poses a risk.<br/>The Bucklesham hemlock's days are numbered.<br/>First reported to Suffolk County Council in June by parish council chairman David Brinkley, the authority has pledged to close the road and remove the offending plant.<br/>In his call to action, Mr Brinkley says delays to the plant's removal \"put children's lives at stake\", with them needing to go into the road to avoid it.<br/>Head teacher Rachael Rudge has similar concerns.<br/>\"To walk on the roads because the path isn't safe because of all the hemlock and vegetation overgrowing, they're being put in this really difficult and unsafe position,\" she says.<br/>But according to Prof Iain Barr, of the University of East Anglia, the removal of the hemlock leaves a further 28,000 still dotted around the UK.<br/>Prof Barr, a professor of field ecology, tells the BBC about a number of other dangerous plants sitting in plain sight and why some pose such a threat.<br/>The giant hogweed - Heracleum mantegazzianum - is not to be messed with, says Prof Barr.<br/>It is one of more than 100 toxic plants found in the UK and listed as potentially harmful by the Royal Horticultural Society.<br/>\"If you touch it and your body reacts to it, it can cause a reaction and makes you very susceptible to sunburn,\" Prof Barr says. \"You don't want to come into contact with any part of it.\"<br/>The toxic sap of the plant, which grows near canals and rivers, can cause burns, blisters and scarring to those who touch it.<br/>The plant, a close relative of cow parsley, has white flowers, thick bristly stems and can grow more than 16ft (5m) tall. <br/>Native to Central Asia, it was introduced into Britain in 1893 as an ornamental plant, but \"escaped from domestication\".<br/>Toxic components in the leaves, stems, roots, flowers and seeds can be transferred to skin by touch. <br/>It is often confused with its native relative, the common hogweed.<br/>\"That's also toxic,\" says Prof Barr. \"But less so.\"<br/>A staple favourite for a shadier spot in the garden, the much-loved foxglove's floral beauty comes with a dark side.<br/>Foxglove - digitalis - is a source of digitoxin, a glycoside in the drug digitalis, which has been used as a heart stimulant since 1785. <br/>It is also well-known for its toxicity in all parts of the plant. <br/>Consuming the leaves can cause oral and abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. <br/>In severe cases, symptoms can include visual disturbances, plus heart and kidney problems.<br/>\"People should just stand back and admire it,\" says Prof Barr. <br/>\"Don't eat it,\" says Prof Barr.<br/>Deadly nightshade is one of the UK's most poisonous plants and just a couple of berries, which contain tropane alkaloids, would be enough to kill a person. <br/>\"It is part of the tomato family,\" says Prof Barr. \"It can be found in woodlands, though it is not quite as common as it used to be.\"<br/>The Solanaceae family is a vast one with more than 2,500 members including tomatoes, potatoes, chillies, aubergines, peppers, tobacco, deadly nightshade and henbane.<br/>Despite its deadly potential, the nerve-gas antidote atropine sulphate can be extracted from it.<br/>\"The hemlock water dropwort is very, very common around the [Norfolk and Suffolk] Broads,\" says Prof Barr. \"It is also very toxic.\"<br/>Also known as the \"poison parsnip\", hemlock water dropwort - Oenanthe crocata - is one of the most poisonous plants native to the UK.<br/>Both hemlock and hemlock water dropwort are part of the carrot family, but live in different habitats and have different toxins.<br/>The tubers, stems and leaves all contain a poisonous and powerful convulsant called oenanthotoxin, which targets the central nervous system.<br/>Hemlock on the other hand contains five alkaloids - coniine, conhydrine, pseudoconhydrine, methyl-coniine and ethyl-piperidine - which cause violent vomiting and paralysis of the nervous system.<br/>Toxic plant related deaths are very rare in the UK - but they do happen. The Office for National Statistics found six people died from the \"toxic effect of ingested plants\" in 2016..<br/>But how do plants become so toxic that they can kill people?<br/>\"It is all to do with chemistry and evolution,\" says Dr Barr. \"Plants have developed toxins to avoid being eaten.<br/>\"So a plant that is slightly more toxic to a grazing animal than the ones next to it has a slight advantage.<br/>\"Over time, this process leads to a point where certain plants can become very toxic to certain species.\"<br/>The majority of the UK's native toxic plants evolved their toxins to deter huge creatures like woolly mammoths or 2m (6ft 6in) tall aurochs, rather than us humans, he said.<br/>\"If an aurochs or mammoth overgrazed, then the plant alkaloids would make it not feel very well,\" he says. <br/>\"It was not designed to kill them, just to make them unwell and to stop eating.\"<br/>Plant toxins certainly did not develop, he says, to prevent children from walking to school.<br/>Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Scientists say the new scanning method could revolutionise medical research.<br/>Cancer Research UK said the new scanning technique had \"a wealth of potential\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Scanning a transparent mouse to reveal the body in unprecedented detail<br/>The researchers say the method reveals far greater detail than existing scanning techniques. In one of the first applications the team has detected cancerous tumours in the first stages of formation.<br/>Prof Ert\u00fcrk says this is important because cancer drugs have to be shown to eliminate tumours in mice before being tested on humans. <br/>\"MRI and PET scans would show you only big tumours. Ours show tumours at the single cell, which they absolutely can't\".<br/>\"Current drugs extend life by a few years and then the cancer comes back. This is because the development process never included eliminating those tiny tumours, which were never visible.\"<br/>Normally lab mice are given cancer and scanned with conventional scans to see how the tumour has progressed. They are then treated with the cancer drug being tested and then scanned again to see what if any difference the treatment has had.<br/>Prof Ert\u00fcrk's scanning method can only be used on dead mice, to give a picture of how much cancer has progressed, or potentially, whether a treatment has worked. He made mice transparent after they were given cancer and then scanned them using his new technique. Only a few mice would need to be made transparent to test the effectiveness of the drug.<br/>Dr Rupal Mistry, research information manager at Cancer Research UK, said:<br/>\"This exciting and unique scanning technique has a wealth of potential for building our knowledge of how our bodies work and what goes wrong in diseases like cancer. <br/>\"While researchers will only be able to use the technique to examine the bodies of deceased mice, it could tell us a lot about how cancer develops at the early stages of the disease. Being able to visualise tumours in the context of the entire body will also give researchers a greater understanding of the impact of different drugs and treatment.<br/>\"Advances in technology like this are essential to driving progress and will hopefully lead to new ways to detect, treat and prevent cancer.\"<br/>The cancer application, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, is just one of hundreds if not thousands to which the new scanning technique can be used to improve medical studies. It can enable researchers to see things they have never seen before.<br/>Mouse studies are often the starting point for learning about processes in the human body. But the new technique can be used on any animals. It could also be used to make human tissues and organs transparent, though it is unlikely to be used to make an entire human body transparent in the near future because there would be no medical advances that could be made from it at this stage.<br/>Creation of the transparent mouse involves removing all the fats and pigment from its corpse, using a chemical process. It ends up looking like a clear plastic toy, which is ever so slightly bendy. Its organs and nerves are all still inside it - but near invisible.<br/>While Prof Ert\u00fcrk's developed the process to make a mouse transparent five years ago, the scanning technique makes the most of it.<br/>He has found a way of adding other chemicals known as antibodies to highlight the parts of the mouse he is interested in studying under a microscope. Different antibodies stick to different types of tissue and so highlight whatever the researchers are interested in looking at.<br/>As well as highlighting cancerous areas, Prof Ert\u00fcrk's team has produced a suite of videos which enable researchers to fly through the mouse's nervous system, gut or lymph system. <br/>The scans have several advantages over what is available now.<br/>First, the researchers can study diseases in the context of the entire body, which gives them a much greater understanding of the impact of different drugs and treatments.<br/>The 3D images are also stored online, so researchers studying different parts of the animal or wanting to do the same experiment can draw from a library, rather than having to use another mouse. Prof Ert\u00fcrk believes that the technique could reduce lab animal use tenfold. <br/>Dr Nana-Jane Chipampe, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, is excited at the prospect of using the new scanning technique to study how cells develop in the human body. Currently she has to slice up tissues into very thin sections to study them under a microscope. Soon she will be able to see details in 3D.<br/>\"I can't wait to get my hands on it!\" she told me enthusiastically.<br/>\"It has the potential to identify new tissues, cells and diseases which will really help us understand the development of diseases.\"<br/>Her team leader, Prof Muzlifah Haniffa, is producing an online map or atlas of every cell in the human body. She says the new scanning technique will be useful for all kinds of medical research. <br/>\"Without a doubt, it will accelerate the pace of medical research,\" she said. \"Combining these cutting-edge technologies and building the human cell atlas will no doubt completely revolutionise medicine.\"<br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

This is negligence driven by cuts and complacency,\" he added. <br/>The brigade said it was now creating 10 wildfire officers and 30 wildfire tactical advisors, who will be trained in the more rural areas of England where wildfires are more common.<br/>The brigade has also been learning new skills and tactics from fire and rescue services in Europe.<br/>LFB was just one of 11 fire and rescue services across the UK to declare a major incident on the day.<br/>The National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) and the UK government are due to draw up new national policy guidelines on wildfires.<br/>Meanwhile, those residents whose homes were destroyed in Wennington last year are still waiting for them to be rebuilt.<br/>Havering Council said it was \"working closely with affected residents to help them get their lives back on track\".<br/>Wennington vicar the Reverend Elise Peterson said the rebuilding of homes was \"slow progress\". <br/>\"There are residents that have lost everything and are still in temporary accommodation.

It is now expected that countries could be given the chance to vote on a new ban over the next month. <br/>Despite the UK not calling for a new ban, a government spokesperson told the BBC: \"The UK will maintain its precautionary position of not supporting the issuing of any exploitation licences unless and until there is sufficient scientific evidence about the potential impact on deep sea ecosystems.\"<br/>Marine scientists have raised concerns that limited research has been carried out in the deep ocean to understand the animals and plants that live there and therefore what the impacts deep sea mining could have on them.  <br/>Potential techniques to harvest the minerals from the sea floor could generate significant noise and light pollution, and release plumes of sediment which risk smothering filter-feeding species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). <br/>\"We mustn't let this be a new gold rush where we launch headlong into further devastating our planet without really understanding what we're doing,\" said Catherine Weller, director of global policy at the conservation charity, Fauna & Flora.<br/>Scientists recently announced that more than 5,000 different animals have been found in the Clarion Clipperton Zone (CCZ) of the Pacific Ocean - a key area earmarked for future mining efforts.<br/>The CCZ and other areas primed for mining like the Pacific Prime Crust are unique environments with hydrothermal vents, underwater mountains, and vast plains up to 6,500m below the surface. Scientists believe they could support uniquely adapted species found nowhere else in the world. <br/>Not all countries are opposed outright to the practice. The ISA has already issued 31 exploration contracts to companies wanting to research the deep ocean, and these have been sponsored by 14 countries including China, Russia, India, the UK, France and Japan. <br/>And the ISA only permits contracts in international waters - countries are free to undertake exploration in their national waters. Last month Norway controversially opened areas in the Greenland Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea covering an area of 280,000 square kilometres (108,000 square miles) for mining companies to apply for licenses. <br/>\"We need minerals to succeed with the green transition,\" Oil and Energy Minister Terje Aasland said in a statement.<br/>The Metals Company, which is partnered with three Pacific Island nations - the Republic of Nauru, the Republic of Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga - is determined to press ahead with applications. <br/>The company has said that the deep-sea offers a promising source of metals such as copper, cobalt and nickel needed for technologies such as mobile phones, wind turbines and EV batteries.<br/>Nick Pickens, research director of global mining at Wood Mackenzie, told the BBC many of these minerals are relatively abundant on land but can be difficult to reach. <br/>The Democratic Republic of Congo which holds some of the highest grade of copper in the world is facing inter-ethnic violent conflict in parts of the country.<br/>There are also a limited number of sites for refining the minerals - turning them from their raw form into useful components.<br/>\"Deep-sea mining doesn't necessarily iron out any of these issues\u2026you are still going to have geopolitical challenges,\" Mr Pickens said.<br/>Companies back moratorium on deep sea mining<br/>Deep sea 'gold rush' moves closer<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Very hot. And we are only a few weeks into summer.<br/>Texas and part of the south-west of the US are enduring a searing heatwave. At one point, more than 120 million Americans were under some form of heat advisory, the US National Weather Service said. That is more than one in three of the total population.<br/>In the UK, the June heat didn't just break all-time records, it smashed them. It was 0.9C hotter than the previous record, set back in 1940. That is a huge margin.<br/>There is a similar story of unprecedented hot weather in North Africa, the Middle East and Asia.<br/>No surprise, then, that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather forecasts said that globally, June was the hottest on record.<br/>And the heat has not eased. The three hottest days ever recorded were in the past week, according to the EU climate and weather service, Copernicus.<br/>The average world temperature hit 16.89C on Monday 3 July and topped 17C for the first time on 4 July, with an average global temperature of 17.04C. <br/>Provisional figures suggest that was exceeded on 5 July when temperatures reached 17.05C.<br/>These highs are in line with what climate models predicted, says Prof Richard Betts, climate scientist at the Met Office and University of Exeter.<br/>\"We should not be at all surprised with the high global temperatures,\" he says. \"This is all a stark reminder of what we've known for a long time, and we will see ever more extremes until we stop building up more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\"<br/>When we think about how hot it is, we tend to think about the air temperature, because that's what we experience in our daily lives.   <br/>But most of the heat stored near the surface of the Earth is not in the atmosphere, but in the oceans. And we've been seeing some record ocean temperatures this spring and summer.  <br/>The North Atlantic, for example, is currently experiencing the highest surface water temperatures ever recorded.<br/>That marine heatwave has been particularly pronounced around the coasts of the UK, where some areas have experienced temperatures as much as 5C above what you would normally expect for this time of year.<br/>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has labelled it a Category 4 heatwave. The designation is rarely used outside of the tropics and denotes \"extreme\" heat.<br/>\"Such anomalous temperatures in this part of the North Atlantic are unheard of,\" says Daniela Schmidt, a professor of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol.<br/>At the same time, an El Ni\u00f1o is developing in the tropical Pacific.  <br/>El Ni\u00f1o is a recurring weather pattern caused when warm waters rise to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean.<br/>With both the Atlantic and the Pacific experiencing heatwaves, it is perhaps not surprising that global sea surface temperatures for both April and May were the highest ever recorded in Met Office data that goes all the way back to 1850.<br/>If the seas are warmer than usual, you can expect higher air temperatures too, says Tim Lenton, professor of climate change at Exeter University.<br/>Most of the extra heat trapped by the build-up of greenhouse gases has gone into warming the surface ocean, he explains. That extra heat tends to get mixed downwards towards the deeper ocean, but movements in oceans currents - like El Ni\u00f1o - can bring it back to the surface.<br/>\"When that happens, a lot of that heat gets released into the atmosphere,\" says Prof Lenton, \"driving up air temperatures.\"<br/>It's easy to think of this exceptionally hot weather as unusual, but the depressing truth is that climate change means it is now normal to experience record-breaking temperatures.  <br/>Greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase year on year. The rate of growth has slowed slightly, but energy-related CO2 emissions were still up almost 1% last year, according to the International Energy Agency, a global energy watchdog.<br/>And the higher the global temperature, the higher the risk of heatwaves, says Friederike Otto, a climatologist at the Grantham Institute of Climate Change at Imperial College London.<br/>\"These heatwaves are not only more frequent, but also hotter and longer than they would have been without global warming,\" she says.<br/>Experts are already predicting that the developing El Ni\u00f1o is likely to make 2023 the world's hottest year.<br/>They fear it is likely to temporarily push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>And that is just the start. Unless we make dramatic reductions to greenhouse gas emissions, temperatures will continue to rise.<br/>The Met Office said this week that record June temperatures this year were made twice as likely because of man-made climate change. <br/>These rising temperatures are already driving fundamental and almost certainly irreversible changes in ecosystems across the world.<br/>The record June temperatures in the UK helped cause unprecedented deaths of fish in rivers and canals, for example.  <br/>We cannot know what impact the current marine heatwave will have on the UK, cautions Prof Schmidt of the University of Bristol, because we have never seen one this intense before. <br/>\"In other regions, around Australia, in the Mediterranean, entire ecosystems changed, kelp forests disappeared, and seabirds and whales starved,\" she says.<br/>The world is effectively in a race. <br/>It is clear we are speeding towards an ever hotter and more chaotic climate future, but we do have the technologies and tools to cut our emissions.<br/>The question now is whether we can do so rapidly enough to slow the climate juggernaut and keep the impacts of global warming within manageable boundaries.<br/>World records hottest day for third time in a week<br/>Are wildfires in the US getting worse?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But that trade is highly polluting, using some of the most carbon heavy fuels to power ships' engines. <br/>These dirty smokestacks produce roughly the same amount of carbon each year as Germany. <br/>But maritime transport has proved hard to regulate as ships are often owned in one country but registered with another. <br/>Small states like the Marshall Islands, Liberia and Panama have huge numbers of ships sailing under their national flags but they have no real responsibility for these vessels.<br/>This complex arrangement meant that shipping was omitted from the Paris climate agreement in 2015 when the world put in place a global plan to tackle rising temperatures. <br/>In 2018 shipping did agree to cut carbon in half by 2050, but this was seen as totally inadequate by scientists.<br/>Now after growing pressure from a coalition of countries including the UK, the US, and Pacific island states, delegates meeting in London have agreed a new strategy that would bring emissions to net-zero \"by or around\" 2050. <br/>Net-zero means that any emissions remaining then would be cancelled out by actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. <br/>Richer countries and small island states had called for a 50% reduction by 2030 and a 96% emissions cut by 2040.<br/>But with resistance from China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and others the new strategy that will see \"indicative checkpoints\" rather than hard targets and these would aim to see emissions from shipping fall by at least 20% by 2030, and at least 70% by 2040. <br/>For both these checkpoints, the agreement says that countries should \"strive\" for a higher target of 30% by 2030 and 80% by 2040.<br/>\"This outcome is far from perfect, but countries across the world came together and got it done - and it gives us a shot at 1.5C,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu's climate change minister.<br/>Keeping global temperatures under 1.5C is a key part of the Paris agreement and scientists agree that allowing the world to warm more than this level would be very dangerous. <br/>Industry voices have also welcomed the new deal, but with reservations. <br/>\"It's a remarkable improvement that the revised strategy now aims to achieve net-zero emissions by or around 2050, and the introduction of indicative 2030 and 2040 checkpoints for emissions reductions sends an important signal to governments and industry,\" said Johannah Christensen, chief executive of the Global Maritime Forum.<br/>\"However, the revised strategy falls short to provide the necessary clarity and strong commitments for a just and equitable Paris Agreement-aligned transition.\"<br/>Many environmental groups were strongly critical of the new agreement saying that shipping's new plan would do very little to keep the world under that key temperature threshold. <br/>\"While the inclusion of 2030 and 2040 emissions reduction targets for shipping is not insignificant, this strategy will see the shipping industry exhaust its 1.5C carbon budget by 2032,\" said Madeline Rose, from the Pacific Environment campaign group.<br/>The new deal also keeps alive the idea of a carbon levy on shipping that has been strongly supported by developing countries, who believe that this measure will be key in bringing down emissions over the decades to come. <br/>\"Ultimately it's not the targets but the incentives we put in place to meet them.

But the UK research community has constantly and unanimously argued for membership of the European Horizon programme. <br/>If Mr Sunak rejects the options on his desk, the anger from the scientific establishment will be ''unimaginable\", according to a senior scientific leader.<br/>Should events go as expected, the deal will come as a huge relief to the scientific community. Many of the UK's leading researchers have been left in limbo over the future of their world-leading research projects and in some cases their own jobs and those of their teams.<br/>Associate membership had been agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement when the UK formally left the EU at the end of January 2020. But the arrangement was not activated because of a disagreement over the Northern Ireland protocol. This was resolved in February of this year and it had been hoped that a deal for Horizon would swiftly follow.<br/>The EU waived the UK's joining fee for the time it had not been a member, but it stuck to the arrangement agreed with former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government about the funding the UK would be expected to receive. <br/>The government had agreed that if UK researchers received less than 12% of what the UK put in, Britain could terminate the arrangement. The figure for other associate members of Horizon is 8%, but it was thought to be a price worth paying for continuing to be part of the programme by the government at the time.<br/>Talks since the Windsor agreement have focussed largely on renegotiating this figure to be more in line with that of other associate members. It is understood that two formulae have now been agreed between the UK and EU, which await the prime minister's signature.<br/>The stand-off has bemused UK researchers because pre-Brexit the UK received around \u00a3500m more than the \u00a31.5bn a year it put in. For Horizon the government has agreed to pay approximately \u00a32bn a year and given the quality of British science, the research community believes it would get at least the same amount back. Many feel that months have been lost haggling over a hypothetical point.<br/>News that a draft agreement had been reached was reported on Wednesday afternoon by Politico, but was greeted by a terse statement from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. <br/>\"Talks are ongoing and, therefore, we have not yet agreed a deal.\"<br/>On Thursday morning Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said the Prime Minister was keen to seek \"value for money for taxpayers\" if the UK is to rejoin the scheme, with \"constructive\" discussions still going on.<br/>''I think overall we want to make sure that any deal, whether it is Horizon or the UK alternative Pioneer, is the one that produces the best value for UK science and research and also for taxpayers. That is what the Prime Minister will consider at the appropriate time.\" <br/>James Wilsdon, a professor of science policy at University College London, told BBC News what while this was \"wonderful news\" the uncertainty over the past three years had \"blighted\" UK-EU scientific collaboration.<br/>\"In haggling over the budget, the UK was in danger of being penny wise but pound foolish \u2014 emphasising short-term costs over the huge long-term gains that will flow from UK participation. <br/>\"Hopefully, a compromise has now been reached and the research community can move forward with the clarity and commitment that it has been crying out for.\"<br/>Professor Lord Krebs, a long-serving and respected scientific adviser to the government from the University of Oxford, said: \"Delays over two years have caused serious and lasting damage to UK R&D.\" <br/>Nobel prize winner Sir Paul Nurse said the prime minister should finalise the deal \"without further delay\", a view echoed by Prof Sarah Main, executive director of Campaign for Science and Engineering.<br/>\"I urge the prime minister and president of the European Commission to secure this agreement, enabling researchers to get on with the vital role they play in improving people's lives and livelihoods,\" she said. <br/>Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, also urged the prime minister to finalise the deal, saying there were a lot of people in Europe \"with their fingers and toes crossed that it gets across the line\". <br/>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said that among the benefits of joining the programme were greater opportunities for research collaboration - as well as access to larger grants for UK universities. <br/>The UK is also seeking to rejoin the Copernicus Earth observation programme.<br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Scientists warn Sunak on EU research programme<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But Mr Sawan said a lack of clarity and stability on energy policy and taxation risked making the UK a less attractive place to invest compared with more welcoming countries. The UK has increased tax on UK-derived profits from 40% to 75% until 2028 unless oil and gas prices fall below thresholds for a sustained period - which most energy experts doubt will happen.  <br/>The UK currently imports more than half of its oil and gas - and that proportion is expected to rise without renewed investment in the North Sea. Shell recently decided to sell its stake in a major new undeveloped oil field at Cambo.  <br/>\"Ultimately the government needs to make a call as to their views on imported versus domestic production,\" said Mr Sawan.<br/>\"When you do not have the stability you require in these long-term investments, that raises questions when we compare that to other countries where there is very clear support for those investments.\"<br/>Mr Sawan was also keen to stress the warm welcome extended to the company by the New York Stock Exchange at a recent investors' meeting where they laid out their plans to cut costs and maximise profits.  <br/>\"The welcome we had there was exemplary. The Shell flag was waving next to the New York Stock Exchange flag,\" he said.<br/>He said that the officials there had underlined his feeling that the US was more supportive of oil and gas companies.  <br/>\"They said we continue to value a company that provides us the energy we desperately need. That resonated with me as a person who comes from Lebanon where we are starved of energy.\" <br/>Mr Sawan did not rule out moving Shell's headquarters and stock market listing to the US. American oil companies command higher prices for their shares - Exxon Mobil for example is worth 40% more than Shell per dollar of profit.  <br/>\"There are many who question whether that valuation gap can only be bridged if we move to the US. A move of headquarters is not a priority for the next three years.\" <br/>But after that? \"I would never rule out anything that could potentially create the right circumstances for the company and its shareholders. Ultimately, I am in the service of shareholder value,\" he said.<br/>Although Shell says it has no plans to move in the short term, Mr Sawan's comments will add to fears that London's stock market is losing its lustre as a venue for multinational companies to raise money after technology darling Arm Holdings recently announced plans to move its primary listing to the US. <br/>A move by the UK's most valuable company to the US would seriously dent Britain's financial prestige and cost jobs in the financial services sector.<br/>Shell trading Russian gas despite pledge to stop<br/>How much windfall tax are oil giants paying?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>In June, scientists declared that El Ni\u00f1o conditions were present. This means that additional heat is now welling up to the surface of the Pacific ocean, pushing up the global temperature. <br/>\"The average global surface air temperature reaching 17C for the first time since we have reliable records available is a significant symbolic milestone in our warming world,\" said climate researcher Leon Simons.<br/>\"Now that the warmer phase of El Ni\u00f1o is starting we can expect a lot more daily, monthly and annual records breaking in the next 1.5 years.\"<br/>Monday's record temperature comes as the month of June was also confirmed as the hottest June in the global record. <br/>Average temperatures across the planet were 1.46C above the average in the period between 1850 and 1900.<br/>The impact of high temperatures is also being felt at the world's extremes. In Antarctica, the July temperature record was recently broken with a reading of 8.7C taken at Ukraine's Vernadsky Research base. <br/>With El Ni\u00f1o likely to strengthen over the coming months, it's likely that more records will be shattered as the northern hemisphere summer goes on.<br/>\"Chances are that July will be the warmest ever, and with it the hottest month ever: 'ever' meaning since the Eemian which is some 120,000 years ago,\" said Karsten Haustein, from the University of Leipzig.<br/>\"While southern hemisphere temperatures will drop a bit in the next few days, chances are that July and August will see even warmer days yet given that El Ni\u00f1o is now pretty much in full swing\".<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill. <br/>These gases increase global temperatures by trapping the sun's energy.<br/>Meanwhile, rapid deforestation across the world means there are fewer trees to absorb CO2.<br/>Under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, 197 countries agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100. <br/>To achieve this, scientists said that net zero CO2 emissions should be reached by 2050.<br/>However, the UN now wants countries to bring forward their net zero targets by a decade to avoid what it called \"the growing climate disaster\".<br/>Not all emissions can be reduced to zero, so those that remain need to be matched by actively removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. This is known as \"offsetting\".<br/>Natural offsetting methods include planting trees and restoring peatlands.<br/>One industrial method is carbon capture and storage which involves using machinery to remove CO2 from the air and store it, often deep underground. However, the technology is still emerging and remains expensive.<br/>Although offsetting is important, it can only cancel out a small fraction of current greenhouse gas emissions.<br/>So scientists say drastic cuts to fossil fuel use are essential to meet the net zero goal.<br/>To help reach net zero by 2050, the UK has made a series of ambitious pledges including:<br/>The government released an updated net zero strategy in March, but many climate experts criticised the announcement for lacking significant new policies or extra investment. <br/>The UK needs to reduce its emissions by 68% by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement - a key step towards net zero by 2050. <br/>But despite the new strategy, the government's independent climate advisers now say they are \"markedly\" less confident than a year ago that the UK will meet the 2050 target. <br/>While the most significant changes need to come from government, individuals will also have to play their part to help reach net zero.<br/>This could include:<br/>Around 140 countries have pledged to reach net zero, covering about 90% of global emissions. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline.<br/>China - currently the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide - aims for \"carbon neutrality\" by 2060. Its plans to cut emissions aren't fully developed, but its renewable energy sector has been growing rapidly.<br/>The US has historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies. <br/>The EU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March it announced its own green investment package, called the Net Zero Industry Act.<br/>India and Russia are also key emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2070 and 2060 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up.<br/>There's controversy about how some countries might try to reach net zero.<br/>For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imported energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself. <br/>But in reality, it wouldn't have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. <br/>There are also schemes that enable rich countries to offset their emissions by paying poorer countries to switch to cleaner fuels. <br/>But some climate scientists worry this could let wealthier nations avoid reducing their fossil fuel usage, by taking advantage of a switch to cleaner fuels in poorer countries which may have happened anyway.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But a BBC investigation tracked one video that has been viewed millions of times - and found the company is struggling to stop false climate information from spreading across the platform.<br/>If you searched for \"climate change\" on TikTok in recent months, you might have come across a video featuring Dan Pe\u00f1a, a self-styled \"business success coach\" with thousands of followers on social media.<br/>The video, shot during the 2017 London premiere of a documentary film about Mr Pe\u00f1a, shows a heated exchange between the American businessman and a member of the audience.<br/>Asked what \"the people with the money\" will do about climate change, he replies: \"The financial institutions and the banks know [climate change] is not going to happen.\"<br/>He adds, without providing any credible evidence: \"It's the greatest fraud that has been perpetrated on mankind this century.\" <br/>Contacted by the BBC, Mr Pe\u00f1a stood by these comments, saying climate change was actually a \"historical norm\" over thousands of years and \"not new\".  He questioned whether it was a \"genuine threat\" as well as the effectiveness of measures proposed by climate change activists in the face of growing emissions from China.  <br/>The overwhelming weight of scientific evidence has found that world temperatures are rising because of human activity, leading to rapid climate change and threatening every aspect of human life.<br/>But while Mr Pe\u00f1a's statements conflict with that scientific evidence, this clip appears to have been edited and re-uploaded by other users from different TikTok accounts dozens of times, racking up more than nine million views in the process. <br/>Under new community guidelines unveiled by TikTok last April, content that \"undermines well-established scientific consensus\" on climate change will not be allowed on the platform. <br/>And yet, the clip depicting Mr Pe\u00f1a is far from an isolated occurrence: the BBC identified 365 different videos in English denying the existence of man-made climate change.  <br/>TikTok itself deems climate change denial to be \"harmful misinformation\". Using tools available to any TikTok user, we reported those videos to the platform under that category. We then waited for at least a day to find out whether they would be taken down. <br/>The company did not remove almost 95% of the posts we flagged up - videos that, having been watched almost 30 million times, appeared to be attracting significant attention. <br/>In a statement to the BBC, TikTok said it is working \"to empower informed climate discussions\", and that it is working with fact-checkers to tackle misinformation. <br/>The company also pointed out that, when users search for videos about climate change, they are being shown a link to a United Nations website on the topic. <br/>But the video of Mr Pe\u00f1a demonstrates how \"bad arguments can spread really fast on TikTok\", says Roshan Salgado D'Arcy, a science communicator who uses social media to debunk viral videos that contain false claims about climate change. <br/>\"There are no real checks and balances to make sure that the information is accurate.\"<br/>The problem is not exclusive to English-speaking TikTok either: BBC Monitoring found dozens of other climate change-denying videos in Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, Portuguese, and Russian. <br/>\"As a member of the public on social media, it must be very easy to get the wrong idea about how certain we are about climate change,\" says Dr Doug McNeall, a scientist from the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research.<br/>\"Misinformation can really damage our discussion about what to do about climate change.\" <br/>TikTok is aware of the problem - which is why, to mark Earth month in April, it announced it would begin actively removing content that contradicts basic climate science. <br/>In a blog post published at the time, it listed as examples of rule-breaking content posts \"denying the existence of climate change or the factors that contribute to it\". <br/>But the reach of videos like those featuring Mr Pe\u00f1a raises questions about how successfully this new policy is being enforced. <br/>\"Rules become irrelevant, if they're not applied consistently, accurately and fairly,\" says Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a UK counter-extremism think tank.<br/>Ms King said this emboldens people to try \"to game the system even more, because they know they can ultimately act with impunity\". <br/>Paul Scully MP, the minister for technology and the digital economy, told the BBC that the government's proposed Online Safety Bill would guarantee that the responsibility of social media platforms to tackle disinformation was \"taken seriously\".<br/>After we shared the findings of our investigation with TikTok, 65 accounts that had been posting wrong information about climate change in breach of the platform's guidelines were permanently removed.  <br/>The company also removed most of the remaining videos that were still online - including several that featured Dan Pe\u00f1a's 2017 talk.  <br/>However, at the time of writing, several copies of the clip featuring Dan Pe\u00f1a describing climate change as the \"greatest fraud\" can still be found on the app. <br/>At the Met Office, Dr McNeall welcomes TikTok's efforts against misinformation, but he questions whether this is a battle the company can win. <br/>\"As a scientist I'm happy to be challenged,\" he says. <br/>\"Maybe we should focus on promoting good climate science information, rather than just removing the content that we perhaps don't like.\"  <br/>The 'ninjas' fighting climate denial on Twitter<br/>A band of volunteers is keeping climate denial off Wikipedia<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Experts say it will likely make 2024 the world's hottest year. <br/>They fear it will help push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>It will also affect world weather, potentially bringing drought to Australia, more rain to the southern US, and weakening India's monsoon.<br/>The event will likely last until next spring, after which its impacts will recede.<br/>For months, researchers have been increasingly confident that an El Ni\u00f1o event was set to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. <br/>\"It's ramping up now, there have been signs in our predictions for several months, but it's really looking like it will peak at the end of this year in terms of its intensity,\" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range predictions at the UK Met Office.<br/>\"A new record for global temperature next year is definitely plausible. It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.<br/>Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: \"Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction.\"<br/>The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around \u00a32.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.<br/>A spokesperson said: \"The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them.\"<br/>Warning of 'very high' wildfire risk for Scotland<br/>Caution urged over countryside fire risks<br/>Fire service warning over disposable barbecues<br/>Highland wildfire could be largest ever in UK<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. <br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Now astronomers may soon be able to watch it happen.<br/>These distortions are happening all the time, all across the Universe.<br/>One of the groups that made the discovery is the European Pulsar Timing Array Consortium (EPTA), led by Prof Michael Kramer of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn. <br/>He told BBC News that the discovery had the potential to change astronomers' ideas about the cosmos forever.<br/>\"It could tell us if Einstein's theory of gravity is wrong; it may tell us about what dark matter and dark energy, the mysterious stuff that makes up the bulk of the Universe, really is; and it could give us a new window into new theories of physics.\"<br/>Further study might give new insights into the role supermassive black holes play in the evolution of all galaxies.<br/>Dr Rebecca Bowler, of Manchester University, told BBC News that researchers believe there to be gigantic black holes at the heart of all galaxies and that that they grow over billions of years. But so far that has all been theoretical.<br/>\"We know supermassive black holes are there, we just don't know how they got there. One possibility is that smaller black holes merge, but there has been little observational evidence for this. <br/>\"But with these new observations we could see such a merger for the first time. And that directly will tell us how the most massive black holes form,\" she said.<br/>The observations were made by studying signals from dead stars called pulsars. These rotate and send out bursts of radio signals at extremely precise intervals. <br/>But researchers, which include astronomers from the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in Cheshire and from Birmingham University, have found that these signals are reaching Earth ever so slightly faster or slower than they should be. And they say the time distortion is consistent with gravitational waves created by the merger of supermassive black holes across the Universe.<br/>Dr Stanislav Babak from Laboratory APC at CNRS, France, said  gravitational waves carried information about ''some of the best-kept secrets of the Universe\".<br/>The newly found gravitational waves are different to the ones detected to date. Those earlier waves are caused by much smaller, star-sized black holes crashing into each other. <br/>The type described in the latest research are thought to be from black holes that are hundreds of millions of times more massive, spiralling in on each other as they get ever closer.<br/>Their gravitational upheaval is so powerful that it distorts time and space - a process that can continue for billions of years until the supermassive black holes finally merge.<br/>The gravitational waves scientists have discovered previously can be thought of as brief rumbles, whereas the new ones are akin to  a background hum that is around us all the time. <br/>Their next step is to take more readings and combine observations. As further progress is made, another goal is to be able to uncover individual pairs of supermassive black holes - assuming they are the source.<br/>It's possible the gravitational waves could also be caused by other exciting phenomena, such as the very first black holes ever created, or exotic structures called cosmic strings, both of which can be thought of as seeds from which the Universe grew.<br/>Gravity is a constant force in our everyday lives. If you let go of a cup it falls and smashes on the ground each time you do so. But in space gravity does not stay the same. It can change if there is a sudden and catastrophic event - such as the collision of black holes.<br/>The event is so cataclysmic that space and time itself is distorted and ripples are sent across the Universe - as happens when a pebble is dropped in a pond. <br/>In the case of gravitational waves, everything in the Universe - the stars, planets and even us - are the water. Everything gets squeezed and stretched and then squashed and flattened ever so slightly as the ripples pass over us. And just like in a pond, the ripples quickly get smaller and disappear. <br/>Gravitational waves from the merger of star-sized black holes were directly detected for the first time in 2015. Very sensitive laser systems measured the ripples produced in the end moments before the collision.<br/>For the type of waves coming from the spiralling supermassive black holes, the pulsar approach is picking up the ripples produced in the billions of years before the final union. <br/>This is akin to a continuous stream of pebbles being thrown into the pond. And because the mergers are happening all across space, the signal comes across as a cacophony.<br/>The EPTA has combined results with a consortium in India (InPTA) and published their study results in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics. <br/>Three other separate, competing research groups, from North America (NANOGrav), Australia (PPTA) and China (CPTA), have published similar assessments, sparking huge excitement across the physics and astronomy community. <br/>Scientists must first confirm their observations. None of the research groups have data that passes the gold standard of less than one in a million chance of error, which is generally required for conclusive proof - although combined, the various teams' results are certainly compelling. <br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The dam acted as a flood defence to places downstream, mainly to the south and south-west.<br/>BBC Verify monitored the four canal entrances using satellite imagery, and by 15 June, all had become disconnected as the reservoir water level kept dropping.<br/>Further images reveal the reservoir, which previously held 18 cubic kilometres of water, had dried up significantly.<br/>Shallower parts of the reservoir were exposed first, revealing some of the original shape of the Dnipro River prior to the dam's construction in 1956.<br/>Images show the canals still contain water further away from the reservoir. It is unclear how long it will take for them to run dry.<br/>Before the war, about 5,840 sq km (2,255 sq miles) of cropland on both sides of the Dnipro river could potentially be serviced by the canals, with more than half the area reliant on irrigation systems. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>These areas yielded about two million tonnes of grain and oil seeds in 2021, according to the Ukrainian government.<br/>Many areas downstream of the reservoir were initially flooded after the dam was destroyed, but the long-term issue facing food production will be the loss of water supply due to extensive canal systems drying up, according to Inbal Becker-Reshef, program director at NASA Harvest, a consortium researching global food security.<br/>\"[The canals] primarily irrigate summer planted crops\u2026 like corn, soy beans, some sunflower. But they also irrigate some wheat, which is a winter crop, and then a lot of vegetables and fruit like melons,\" she said. <br/>While some crops can be fed by rain alone, a dry canal system can leave farmland vulnerable to drought. This also has consequences for drinking water.<br/>Dr Becker-Reshef said canals can start to fill in with silt if left dry, reducing their effectiveness, and the longer they are left in this condition, the worse they will become.<br/>Martin Griffiths, Emergency Relief Coordinator for the UN, previously told the BBC there would be a \"huge impact on global food security\" as a result of the destruction of the dam, describing the area as \"a breadbasket not only for Ukraine but also for the world\".<br/>Ukraine is a major exporter of sunflower, maize, wheat and barley. The war has caused global supply issues, particularly threatened in Middle Eastern and African countries, which rely heavily on Ukrainian grain.<br/>Rebuilding the dam seems to be one of the only long-term solutions to restore water security to the area.<br/>\"Now the water level has dropped, the water simply does not reach the [canal] systems. To raise it, we need to rebuild the dam,\" according to Mykola Solskyi, Ukraine's Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food.<br/>Experts warn the area is at greater risk of both drought and flooding, because the dam helped regulate extreme highs and lows in water levels.<br/>\"There's now a whole downstream catchment of the river that is not controlled,\" said Jaap Flikweert, a flood and coastal management advisor at engineering consultancy Royal HaskoningDHV. \"In the wetter periods flood waves will just come through.\"<br/>Unless the dam is repaired, or extensive flood defences put in place, Mr Flikweert said some areas may prove unsuitable for settlement because they lie so close to river level.<br/>\"I expect those tens of thousands of people who were evacuated will have to stay away for a while as long as those solutions are not in place. It is difficult to see people coming back to those communities in this situation.\"<br/>Read more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify<br/>Dam destruction devastates vast Ukraine farmland<br/>Drinking water crisis after dam breach - Zelensky<br/>What is the Ukraine grain deal?<br/>Harvest<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

This is likely to be a reflection of the Radio 2 afternoon show being cut by an hour, as well as Mills' exit from his 5 Live Saturday programme.<br/>Vanessa Feltz left her early breakfast show on Radio 2 and her BBC Radio London morning programme in September for a new job on Talk TV, and as such she too has dropped off the star salaries list.<br/>Her former colleague Ken Bruce left his mid-morning programme in March to join Greatest Hits Radio, but as he stayed with the BBC virtually until the end of the accounting period, his salary for last year was steady at \u00a3390,000.<br/>He will drop off next year and his replacement Vernon Kay will almost certainly feature instead.<br/>News personalities Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel also left the BBC for the commercial sector at the end of the previous financial year, which means they no longer feature on the list.<br/>But there are also new entries. Rick Edwards made \u00a3178,000 after replacing Nicky Campbell on BBC Radio 5 Live's breakfast show. <br/>His co-host Rachel Burden's salary has gone up slightly to \u00a3195,000 - but she also guest-presented some editions of BBC Breakfast.<br/>Today programme presenter Justin Webb earned \u00a325,000 more than last year, taking his salary to \u00a3280,000, after he took on a new role presenting Americast.<br/>Victoria Derbyshire has also been given a raise of \u00a350,000, bringing her salary to \u00a3295,000, as she took on a new role presenting Newsnight.<br/>The threshold for appearing on the salaries list is \u00a3178,000. The only Radio 1 presenter whose salary was above that was Greg James, who earned \u00a3335,000 for hosting the station's breakfast show as well as Radio 4's Rewinder.<br/>BBC Breakfast host Sally Nugent appeared to make slightly less (between \u00a3178,000-184,999) than her co-presenter Jon Kay (\u00a3185,000-189,000), despite hosting more editions of the programme than him.<br/>However, it is not a like-for-like comparison because Kay's salary does not constitute a full year in that role, as he only took over from Dan Walker in July, and his earnings will include work undertaken in his previous job as a news correspondent.<br/>The salary list shows four women are in the top 10 this year, an improvement on last year's three despite the departure of Feltz.<br/>BBC newsreader Sophie Raworth (\u00a3365,000) and 6Music and Desert Island Discs host Lauren Laverne (\u00a3390,000) are now in the top 10 highest earners, as Wright and Mills dropped out.<br/>News anchor Huw Edwards climbed from sixth to fourth place, with his salary up by \u00a325,000 to \u00a3435,000.<br/>The highest new entry in the list, with \u00a3260,000, was Ros Atkins, one of the hosts of BBC Radio 4's The Media Show as well as the corporation's analysis editor.<br/>The salaries list is nowhere near a complete picture of what top talent at the BBC earn, as so many stars are paid through production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm BBC Studios. <br/>The government previously agreed that BBC Studios did not have to disclose talent pay so it could be treated on a level playing field with the rest of the commercial sector.<br/>That means household names such as Michael McIntyre, Tess Daly, Paddy McGuinness, Alex Jones, Jools Holland and the Strictly judges are absent.<br/>Quiz show hosts Richard Osman, Sandi Toksvig, Victoria Coren-Mitchell, Romesh Ranganathan and Alexander Armstrong are also not named.<br/>Similarly, the casts of some of the corporation's biggest dramas such as EastEnders, Happy Valley, Peaky Blinders, Casualty, Call The Midwife and Doctor Who do not appear on the list despite many actors undoubtedly making large sums from the BBC.<br/>Some stars do appear on the list, but only for some of their BBC commitments. For example, Evan Davis has his salary listed for presenting BBC Radio 4's PM programme, but not for hosting Dragons' Den.<br/>Claudia Winkleman and Graham Norton, who both make huge sums of money from hosting BBC programmes and have featured high up the list in previous years, are also both now absent because of the way they are paid. <br/>The BBC's pay for top talent was at a six-year high last year, the annual report's figures show.<br/>The corporation's income from the licence fee was down from \u00a33.8bn to \u00a33.74bn, which the BBC said was due to flat licence fee pricing and a decline in paid-for TV licences.<br/>BBC pay: The 2022-2023 star salaries list in full<br/>BBC boss 'sorry' after sport disruption in Lineker row<br/>Young person's family stand by BBC presenter claims<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

However, he also says he told the BBC he had contacted the police and was told nothing illegal had taken place.<br/>The BBC has not yet clarified what allegations were made in May and what new information it received last week. BBC director-general Tim Davie is set to face questions about the row in a scheduled media appearance on Tuesday.<br/>The lawyer for the young person said they had sent a denial to the Sun about the allegations made by their mother before the newspaper published the story on Friday. <br/>The Sun said it had seen evidence to back the mother's claims.<br/>But in a letter sent on Monday to the BBC, the lawyer said the young person had sent a message to the paper on Friday saying the statement made by their mother was \"totally wrong and there was no truth to it\".<br/>Nonetheless, the lawyer added, the Sun newspaper proceeded to publish \"their inappropriate article\".<br/>\"For the avoidance of doubt, nothing inappropriate or unlawful has taken place between our client and the BBC personality and the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish,\" the lawyer wrote.<br/>The young person's lawyer said press reporting amounted to an invasion of privacy, and criticised both the Sun and the BBC for not contacting their client.<br/>\"Nobody from the Sun newspaper appears to have made any attempt to contact our client prior to the publication of the allegations on Friday 6 July,\" the lawyer writes.<br/>The lawyer also claimed in the letter that the mother and the young person were estranged.<br/>In response, the Sun said: \"We have reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child.<br/>\"Their complaint was not acted upon by the BBC. We have seen evidence that supports their concerns. It's now for the BBC to properly investigate.\"<br/>Mr Davie said in an email to BBC staff on Sunday that the corporation took the claims about its presenter \"incredibly seriously\".<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the allegations \"were shocking and concerning\".<br/>He told journalists the government has been assured the process being undertaken by the BBC \"is rigorous and will be swift\". <br/>\"Given the concerning nature of the allegations it's right they're investigated swiftly and rigorously and it's important we now let that carry on\".<br/>The former editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, has said the original story presented in The Sun was \"clearly one in which there was public interest\" and the BBC had questions to answer, but had become \"much more muddled\". <br/>He said it was \"curious\" the person involved was not approached and that their account was not included, he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight programme<br/>BBC News does not know the identity of the young person and has not spoken directly to them.<br/>It has not seen any of the Sun's body of evidence or the dossier the Sun reported was handed to the corporation by the family over the weekend. <br/>The BBC said on Sunday that a staff member had been suspended but it did not identify him.<br/>The corporation said it was working as fast as possible \"to establish the facts in order to properly inform appropriate next steps\".<br/>If the presenter obtained sexually explicit images of the young person when they were under 18 years old, that is a matter for investigation as a possible criminal offence. The age of consent is 16, but a person under the age of 18 is not an adult. The law says they cannot consent to taking part in \"indecent photographs\".<br/>The Metropolitan Police is \"assessing\" information from the BBC over the allegations made against the presenter but has said there is currently no investigation. Detectives held a virtual meeting with BBC representatives on Monday.<br/>Media lawyer Mark Stephens told BBC Breakfast the investigation has a \"long way to go\" yet, and \"it does appear that even the police don't think that there was an obvious criminal offence having been committed\".<br/>\"Of course that reduces any public interest in naming the presenter,\" he said.<br/>In its report on Friday, the Sun claimed that a BBC presenter had paid the individual tens of thousands of pounds for the images, starting when the young person was 17. <br/>The paper also claimed the BBC presenter had made what it called two \"panicked calls\" to the young person - who is now 20 - after the original story came out.<br/>With stories like this one, BBC News journalists treat the BBC in the same way as any other organisation the news service reports on.<br/>And like with any other organisation, BBC News has to ask BBC management or BBC services for responses and contact the BBC press office for official statements.<br/>Occasionally BBC journalists approach senior managers for unplanned interviews - known as \"doorsteps\" in the news business.<br/>They sometimes also get offered interviews with management - like this one with Mr Davie over the Gary Lineker row.<br/>And when this happens, they know they will be scrutinised within and outside the BBC over how well they hold their boss to account.<br/>Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

An audit of the Irish organisation's finances found irregularities with what was in the public domain and what the accounts actually showed.<br/>After further reading, the corporation has been accused of running \"a slush fund\" - spending thousands on flip-flops and gig tickets as well as millions on a failed musical, all \"while crying poverty\".<br/>Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar has said reform of how the institution is funded is well overdue.<br/>Unlike the BBC, the Irish broadcaster is funded using advertising revenue as well as a licence fee, and the scandal has dented the trust its audience has in it.<br/>\"RT\u00c9 has such a big place in Irish society, so this scandal was always going to be big news,\" freelance entertainment reporter Emma Kelly tells BBC News.<br/>\"The Late Late Show in particular is such a cultural touchstone, so when people find out that RT\u00c9 and Ryan Tubridy haven't been fully transparent, it's going to hurt.\" <br/>The programme Tubridy presented until recently is not only an Irish institution - with a packed live audience for more than two hours each Friday night - but is the longest-running late-night talk show in Europe. The format smoothly flips between light entertainment interviews to serious society debate, with pop stars performing in the studio as well.<br/>\"The whole thing feel feels like a betrayal,\" Kelly explains. \"The more ridiculous details that emerge or big names that get dragged in, the harder it is to look away.\"<br/>Tuesday will be the first time Tubridy has spoken publicly since the scandal was first reported. He'll appear with his agent Noel Kelly for hours of questioning.<br/>Before the controversy was made public, the 50-year-old stood down as host of The Late Late Show after nearly 14 years, to be replaced by Patrick Kielty.<br/>On Monday, former BBC News executive Kevin Bakhurst took over as director general and promptly stood down the entire executive board.<br/>He wrote in an email to staff: \"Change will be essential if we are to rebuild trust in public service broadcasting in Ireland and in RT\u00c9.\"<br/>RT\u00c9 board stood down by new director general<br/>Your questions on RT\u00c9's payment scandal answered<br/>New RT\u00c9 boss vows to 'restore trust' with public<br/>RT\u00c9 spent \u20ac5,000 on flip-flops<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Such a condition would make them inadmissible in most states, but Michigan law allows for handwritten wills as long as they meet other criteria.<br/>Theodore White II - Franklin's third child, from her brief marriage to her former manager - argues that the notarised 11-page document from 2010 is the valid will.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Aretha Franklin: In her own words<br/>That version lists him as a co-executor or personal representative to the estate, along with Ms Owens, the niece. It also calls for Kecalf and Edward Franklin, the singer's second and fourth sons, to \"take business classes and get a certificate or a degree\" if they wish to benefit from the estate.<br/>Meanwhile, Kecalf and Edward argue that the 2014 version is their mother's primary will.<br/>Kecalf replaces his brother as a co-executor in the four-page document. He and his grandchildren would also inherit his mother's $1.2m (\u00a3934,000) gated mansion - a home described by Edward's attorney as \"the crown jewel\".<br/>The newer document also stipulates that Franklin's gowns either be auctioned or handed over to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington.<br/>Clarence Franklin, the eldest child, is not involved in the dispute. He lives in an assisted living facility in Michigan and is under a legal guardianship.<br/>A lawyer for his guardian told the BBC they will not participate in the trial and \"have reached a settlement that gives Clarence a percentage of the estate without regard to the outcome of the will contest\".<br/>The family rift had earlier driven Ms Owens to quit as representative of her aunt's estate.<br/>\"Given my aunt's love of family and desire for privacy, this is not what she would have wanted for us, nor is it what I want,\" she wrote in a 2020 court filing. <br/>\"I love my cousins, hold no animosity towards them, and wish them the best.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Fans pay their respects to Aretha Franklin in Detroit<br/>Earlier this year, the court in Pontiac, Michigan, heard three voicemail messages, recorded in the months before Franklin died, in which she discusses another will she was preparing with an estate lawyer. <br/>In the messages, Franklin is heard expressing certain \"firm intentions\" from a Detroit hospital bed, but attorney Henry Grix testified he believed she \"hadn't made up her mind\" about her final wishes.<br/>The judge has excluded that document from consideration in the trial.<br/>The Franklin fortune was estimated at $80m when the star died in 2018, but more recent valuations and several years of unpaid taxes have vastly reduced that number.<br/>According to an inventory filed in court, and seen by the BBC, the late singer's assets are valued at just under $6m.<br/>Nicholas Papasifakis, who currently serves as Franklin's personal representative, said he is not participating in the trial and is not taking a side in the dispute.<br/>\"Once there has been a determination by the Court as to the disposition of Ms Franklin's Estate,\" he wrote in an email, \"I will follow that determination in distributing Ms Franklin's assets.\"<br/>Aretha Franklin: Three wills discovered<br/>Aretha Franklin wins posthumous Pulitzer<br/>'Aretha Franklin's music is everywhere you turn'<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

They said she was a Brooklyn hipster with artificially inflated lips and carped her father was a millionaire who - allegedly - bankrolled her career.<br/>But those critiques, dripping with misogyny, have not aged well. <br/>Del Rey's atmospheric, orchestral pop has inspired a generation of female singer-songwriters - Olivia Rodrigo, Lorde, Halsey. As Billie Eilish says: \"Lana raised us.\" <br/>And last year, before inviting Del Rey to duet on her latest album, Taylor Swift said simply: \"She's the best we ever had.\" <br/>Over the years, Del Rey's music has evolved and become more nuanced, while never quite departing from the twin topics that obsess her,  toxic relationships and America - and, by proxy, America's toxic relationship with itself. <br/>Her high-water mark, 2019's Norman... Rockwell!, an album painted in the palette of classic Californian rock, produced by frequent Swift collaborator Jack Antonoff, saw her take full control of her narrative. And on the sublime Mariners Apartment Complex, she even addresses the people - critics, boyfriends, record-industry bigwigs - who \"mistook my kindness for weakness\", the not-exactly-hidden subtext being: \"That won't happen again, schmucks.\"<br/>Del Rey has released three albums since then, with this year's Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd? marking a detour into more confessional territory. She frets about having children, the imminence of death and her family's history of cancer, her voice more vulnerable and human than before. <br/>Filled with gospel harmonies and softly building pianos, it challenges Norman... Rockwell! as her best album yet - and the title track was one of the biggest highlights of her Hyde Park set.<br/>Del Rey is an intriguing performer - sometimes fully present, at others seemingly lost in the music. Often, she will mouth words off-microphone, as though singing a private melody to herself. <br/>It is mesmerising to watch, like peeking through the window into her apartment as she writes. And that sensation is only heightened when she sits at a dresser while a stylist tackles her hair - \"done up real big, beauty-queen style,\" to quote Summertime Sadness - freeing her tresses to tumble over her shoulders. <br/>This too could be interpreted as a dig at Glastonbury, where Del Rey jokingly blamed her delay on her hairdressers - except, she staged the exact same interlude at Worthy Farm.<br/>But for all of the shenanigans, the focus remains on the songs - from big hits Born to Die, Ultraviolence and Blue Jeans to beloved album cuts Pretty When You Cry and White Mustang.<br/>Del Rey's voice is better than it has ever been. Throughout the show, she plays with her melodies, exploring new harmonies and breathing fresh emotional life into well-worn songs, And although she never touches an instrument, Del Rey is totally in control of the music. <br/>A tiny gesture to her pianist lets him know she wants to vary the tempo of Candy Necklaces - performed while perched on top of a gold-plated grand piano, naturally. On Arcadia, a lovelorn letter to LA, Del Rey trades riffs with her backing singers, again teasing out the song's ending.<br/>Fans' ears prick up when she changes the lyrics to 2021's Chemtrails over the Country Club, seemingly taking a venomous swipe at her ex-boyfriend Sean Larkin.<br/>\"He was born in December and he got married while we were still in couple's therapy together,\" Del Rey sings over the outro. \"Sometimes I wonder what his wife would think if she knew.\"<br/>If her heart is broken, the audience is there for her. One fan has even turned up with a picture of Mr Larkin on his T-shirt, a giant red \"X\" superimposed over the top.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And at 01:30, when she finally left the venue, she stopped to greet others who had waited at the exits.<br/>\"You've always got to take your chance to say hello, because you just never know,\" she said from the stage, blowing a kiss.<br/>It is something fans know only too well - BST and Glastonbury were her only UK dates since a 2019 performance at Latitude Festival and Del Rey has not toured in England for 10 years.<br/>But based on this magical, luminous performance, she would be welcomed back any time - even by Glastonbury.<br/>Bruce Springsteen settles an old score in Hyde Park<br/>Guns N' Roses wow Glastonbury but Lana is cut short<br/>Lana Del Rey's rude awakening<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

That quickly went. <br/>\"He was slightly despondent in conversation and didn't really want to talk about acting. Everything was very quick. <br/>\"Nothing was a developing conversation. In hindsight, he just had one thing he wanted to do. He obviously had one thing on this mind.\"<br/>The court heard the man claim that Spacey gave him a \"low-waisted hug\" and put his head in his crotch while they were sitting on a couch.<br/>He told police during the recorded interview that he was \"a bit tipsy\", adding: \"It's unusual in my behaviour to just conk out and that's what I did.\"<br/>Recounting the alleged assault, he said his \"very first image\" after waking up was the actor performing a sex act on him.<br/>The complainant told police: \"I said no, he kind of carried on and I pushed him, and he stopped. <br/>\"He stood up. My belt was still together but my buttons were undone. I was zipping up and massively in shock. <br/>\"He said I think it was best you go. He said I should leave, and I shouldn't tell anyone about this. <br/>\"Because I was in such shock, I don't know what I thought.\" <br/>The man said he had heard Spacey liked \"young, straight boys\" but \"didn't know at that point he was a predator\".<br/>He said he cried while waiting for a bus home and had been afraid to go to police over the incident.<br/>Asked why he had not initially reported it, he said: \"It's David and Goliath isn't it, and speaking to police, and being the only one. <br/>\"I did not have the confidence\u2026it was so deeply buried. I didn't even tell friends.\"<br/>During in-person cross-examination in court, the complainant said he believed he was drugged by Spacey and described him as a \"vile, sexual predator\" who \"raped\" him.The complainant was quizzed by Patrick Gibbs KC on behalf of Spacey, who questioned his motives for coming forward.Mr Gibbs suggested that money worries might have been behind him going to police and approaching media outlets, and asked questions about his spending and gambling habits.The defence said the complainant had discussions with lawyers about seeking millions in compensation from Spacey.Mr Gibbs also put questions to the complainant about his sexuality, and suggested that he knew Spacey wanted to \"hook up\" with the complainant when he agreed to go to his flat.<br/>In January, Mr Spacey pleaded not guilty to three counts of indecent assault, three counts of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.<br/>He also previously denied four further charges of sexual assault and one count of causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.<br/>All four accusers are entitled to lifelong anonymity under the law.<br/>The trial continues.<br/>Additional reporting by Sean Seddon<br/>Spacey came out to 'disguise' behaviour, jury told<br/>Kevin Spacey grabbed man like a cobra, court hears<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Super.\"<br/>Those who made it through found that tickets were priced between \u00a358 and \u00a3194. General admission was \u00a3110, with standing tickets at the front of the concert priced at \u00a3172.25.<br/>There were also VIP packages, which come with bonus merchandise and other perks, including early entry, which ranged in price from \u00a3196 to \u00a3662.<br/>Swift's 13 UK concerts next summer are among the most in-demand the country has ever seen, with millions registering for the chance to see the pop superstar's first shows since 2018.<br/>Although Ticketmaster hasn't revealed how many people signed up, the numbers are thought to be similar to Australia - where four million people enrolled for the chance to get one of 450,000 tickets.<br/>The lucky fans who were successful on Monday were overwhelmed with relief. \"I am fully sobbing in my room,\" wrote Zoe on Twitter.<br/>\"Housemate Lucy got Taylor Swift tickets, so everything is now alright in the world and there is no tension in the living quarters,\" added singer Grace Davies.<br/>Further pre-sales on Monday afternoon also appeared to proceed smoothly, with fans rejoicing at their success by quoting one of Swift's lyrics: \"We survived the great war.\"<br/>However, the fan pre-sales are merely a trial run for the general sale, which takes place next week. With more tickets available, and more people trying to get hold of them, the chances of disappointment will increase.<br/>Tips and hints on how to maximise your chance for success are below.<br/>The times have been staggered to make sure that ticketing systems don't get overwhelmed. <br/>Here's how the tickets will be released for people who registered last month:<br/>Monday 17 July 2023<br/>Tuesday 18 July 2023<br/>Wednesday 19 July 2023<br/>If you pre-ordered Midnights from Taylor's official store, you should have received a pre-sale code by email. Bear in mind that it may have landed in your spam folder.<br/>The pre-sales take place at the following times:<br/>Monday 10 July 2023<br/>Tuesday 11 July 2023<br/>Wednesday 12 July 2023<br/>However, a pre-sale code does not guarantee you a ticket, and only a percentage of the total number of tickets will be reserved for the fan pre-sale.<br/>Unfortunately, you're out of luck. Only fans who registered with Ticketmaster within three days after the dates were announced on 20 June can access the general sale.<br/>Even then, they're not guaranteed tickets. Some will receive an on-sale code the afternoon before tickets go on sale. Others will be placed on a waiting list. <br/>If you don't get a code immediately, don't panic. Taylor has already added an extra date in London, and there could be more to come. <br/>If you do get an access code, here are a few key pieces of advice. <br/>Customers are limited to four tickets each. <br/>If you have access codes for more than one city, you will need to go through the process for each separate date.<br/>Don't panic buy tickets from unofficial websites. Scammers prey on fans' desperation, and there have been many cases of people listing fake tickets on dubious websites.<br/>Secondly, keep an eye out for last-minute ticket releases. Often, a few seats become available in the days before a show, once the production has loaded into the venue. Keep checking Ticketmaster as the gigs get closer.<br/>Last of all, trust in the power of Swifties. There are several accounts on Facebook and Twitter where fans trade tickets they can't use at face value, making sure the seats don't go to waste. <br/>Again, however, keep an eye out for scammers. Immediately after the first batch of tickets went on sale, brand new Twitter accounts with no followers were offering seats at face value. They were almost undoubtedly fake.<br/>If you do manage to secure a seat, you're in for a treat. Taylor's latest tour is a three-hour extravaganza that looks back over each of her 10 studio albums.<br/>The 44-song concert also incorporates a \"one-off\" acoustic set every night, with Taylor promising to play a different track at every venue. <br/>So far, the acoustic section has included fan favourites like Mirrorball, Snow On The Beach and Getaway Car alongside more mainstream hits like Welcome To New York and her debut single Tim McGraw.<br/>She's also been joined by special guests including country star Maren Morris, rapper Ice Spice, singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers and British singer Marcus Mumford.<br/>Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It \"was very serious\", according to director general Tim Davie.<br/>They said they emailed the complainant to ask for more information so they could verify the claims, and carried out checks to verify the identity of the complainant.<br/>The BBC's corporate investigations team had received no reply to the email so tried to call the mobile number provided by the complainant. They said the call didn't connect.<br/>However, the Sun later reported that \"the family say no-one from the corporation rang them for a proper interview after the initial complaint\".<br/>The BBC said no additional attempts to contact the complainant were made after this date, but the case \"remained open\".<br/>The Sun newspaper told the BBC via the corporate press office about allegations concerning a presenter. According to the BBC, the claims made by the Sun contained new allegations, which were different from those received by the investigations team.<br/>The BBC said this was the first time Mr Davie or any executive directors were made aware of the case. They set up an incident management group to lead the response.<br/>A senior manager spoke to the presenter about the allegations. It was agreed that they shouldn't appear on air while the allegations were being investigated, the BBC said.<br/>The Sun's first story was published, about the mother's claims that a BBC presenter paid their child tens of thousands of pounds for explicit photos over three years.<br/>The paper quoted the mother as saying the young person used the money to fund a crack cocaine habit, and that she was worried her child could \"wind up dead\".<br/>The young person sent a WhatsApp message to the paper on this evening denying the claims, saying their mother's statement was \"totally wrong and there was no truth to it\", according to a later letter from their lawyer.<br/>In its first public statement, the BBC said that if it receives information requiring further investigation, steps it takes include \"actively attempting to speak to those who have contacted us in order to seek further detail and understanding of the situation\".<br/>It added: \"If we get no reply to our attempts or receive no further contact that can limit our ability to progress things but it does not mean our enquiries stop. If, at any point, new information comes to light or is provided - including via newspapers - this will be acted upon appropriately, in line with internal processes.\"<br/>The BBC also made contact with the Metropolitan Police regarding the allegations.<br/>The Sun published further allegations, quoting the mother as saying the presenter was pictured in his underwear \"ready for my child to perform for him\".<br/>The BBC said it received some materials from the family member regarding the complaint on this and the following day.<br/>Meanwhile, following speculation about the star's identity on social media, BBC presenters including Gary Lineker, Jeremy Vine, Rylan Clark and Nicky Campbell deny involvement to publicly clear their names.<br/>The BBC said it had suspended a male staff member and was \"working as quickly as possible to establish the facts in order to properly inform appropriate next steps\". <br/>\"It is important that these matters are handled fairly and with care,\" a statement said.<br/>The Metropolitan Police said it had \"received initial contact from the BBC in relation to this matter, but no formal referral or allegation has been made\".<br/>The Sun reported that the presenter allegedly made two calls to the young person and asked them \"what have you done\", and appealed to them to call their mother to \"stop the investigation\".<br/>Representatives from the BBC met detectives from the Met's Specialist Crime Command. The force said it was \"assessing\" information from the BBC, but there was \"no investigation at this time\".<br/>In a letter to the BBC, the lawyer representing the young person at the centre of the allegations disputed their mother's account of events, saying \"the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish\".<br/>The letter claimed the young person sent the newspaper a denial on Friday, but that it proceeded to publish \"their inappropriate article\".<br/>In response, the Sun said it \"reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child\".<br/>Their complaint \"was not acted upon by the BBC\" and it had \"seen evidence that supports their concerns\", the Sun added. \"It's now for the BBC to properly investigate.\"<br/>The parents told the Sun they stood by their account. The step-father was quoted as saying the allegations were originally put to the BBC \"for an hour\".<br/>The article also reported that the step-father originally went to police about the matter but was told \"they couldn't do anything as they said it wasn't illegal\".<br/>During a press conference to launch the BBC's annual report, Mr Davie gave more details of the corporation's response. The BBC accepted there were \"lessons to be learned following this exercise\".<br/>The director general said he wanted to examine whether the BBC raises \"red flags quick enough\" when such complaints are made. The BBC's group chief operating officer will assess whether protocols and procedures are appropriate.<br/>The BBC also said the police had asked the corporation to \"pause its investigations into the allegations while they scope future work\".<br/>'Nothing inappropriate' in BBC presenter row - lawyer<br/>Police assessing information on BBC presenter<br/>Family 'upset' with BBC response to presenter claims<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But for some young people who have been in care, support can drop away when they reach 18 and leave the care system.<br/>\"Daniel will be part of our life forever. He's as much part of the family as me,\" says actor and presenter Joe Swash. <br/>Joe's mother, Kiffy, has been a foster carer for more than 11 years - Daniel came to live with her when he was seven. Now aged 18, he lives away while studying at university - but his home is still with Kiffy.<br/>\"My mum can't wait to get him home,\" says Joe, adding that as far as Kiffy is concerned, her role is far from over. <br/>\"You don't just suddenly grow up at 18,\" he says. \"As for Daniel, that's a job for life for my mum.\"<br/>In the UK, young people officially leave care at 18. Under England's guidelines they are still entitled to some support from their local council up to the age of 25. This includes access to a personal adviser who takes over responsibility for supporting the young person, offering advice and information to help them live independently.<br/>However, support can differ slightly depending on a person's age and time spent in care. Kiffy says she was shocked when Daniel turned 18 and \"nothing clicked in\" for him.<br/>A charity for children in care and care leavers, Become, says many young people are expected to be independent before they are ready and often at a moment when they most need stability.<br/>It says many of the young people it works with, describe approaching 18 as like a \"cliff edge\" or \"like being on death row\".<br/>\"They're counting down the days until their 18th birthday, because that's when their placements are stopped and they're basically expected to become independent overnight,\" says Clare Bracey, director of policy and campaigns.<br/>\"When you think about that in relation to other children who are living with their parents, that support doesn't get cut off overnight.\"<br/>The support young people are entitled to after 18 can vary depending on where they live and their local authority.<br/>\"One of the things that young people say to us is, nobody should become a care leaver, care shouldn't leave you,\" Clare adds.<br/>Young people can face a multitude of issues when leaving care, according to the charity Action for Children. <br/>Independence can mean having to move into new accommodation, finding employment or training, managing finances, paying bills, budgeting, and learning how to cook and shop. Life skills which people usually learn over a period of time.<br/>Joe Swash has made a documentary about the care system for BBC One. He feels there is no point sending young people out into the world and asking them to look after themselves without the life lessons or the skills they need to enable that.<br/>\"Once you fall through that net, there's not many people there to catch you,\" he says. \"I almost feel like we're setting them up for failure.\"<br/>In January 2022, the regulator for children's services, Ofsted, published a report into care leavers. It found more than a third of people in England, who had been in care and who responded to its online survey, felt they had left too early and did not feel equipped with the skills to be able to live more independently. <br/>Karl, 18, spent time in four different foster placements and three different care homes before the age of 14. He then moved to a privately owned children's home. As he approached 18, staff helped prepare him by teaching him the life skills he'd need before he moved out. But he says he felt frightened and anxious all the same.<br/>\"It's the real world at the end of the day, like I'm put into adulthood,\" he says.<br/>Karl would have liked to have stayed on a couple more years to adjust.<br/>\"It does feel like it's forced on to me,\" he says. \"It's just another challenge at the end of the day for me to face. There is no structure to it, there's no firm ground to hold on.\"<br/>Joe Swash says he also worries about the lack of emotional support for care leavers - something he says most people take for granted.<br/>\"It's not until you meet these young people that are vulnerable - they're anxious about their future, they haven't got all this around them.\"<br/>An independent review of children's social care in England, commissioned by the government, was published in 2022. It concluded that the care system needed a complete reset.<br/>Josh MacAlister, who oversaw the review, says the system was built for younger children, not teenagers, and that the past few decades have seen a growing number of teenagers in care, along with high demand for children's homes and not enough foster homes.<br/>He says one of the missions in the review is that every young person reaching the age of 18 should have \"at least two people in their life that love them, two lifelong loving relationships\".<br/>\"If you don't have that, it leaves you kind of anchorless at sea,\" he says.<br/>The Department for Education (DfE) says it provides a range of support for care leavers to make the move from care to independent living as smooth as possible, and that the allowance for those leaving care has recently risen from \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,000. This can be put towards purchasing essentials, such as furniture or white goods, when they move into their first home.<br/>The DfE also says it provides funding to local authorities to support young people leaving care from children's homes, by providing an offer of move-on accommodation, alongside a package of practical and emotional support, \"provided by a member of staff from their former children's home or from someone who they know and trust\".<br/>Clare Bracey from Become says she would like to see this scheme extended to ensure all care leavers up to the age of 25 receive this support - rather than the current proposal, which is to 23.<br/>In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland there are also attempts to offer more support to young people transitioning from care to independent life until the age of 21 - and to provide after care support until the ages of 25 or 26.<br/>Joe Swash says society also has a responsibility and it is vital to have adults who are \"willing to put their neck on the line for these young kids\" and look after them beyond the age of their time in care.<br/>Joe and his wife, TV personality Stacey Solomon, have spoken about fostering in the future. Joe says they have seen how fulfilling it has been for Kiffy.<br/>\"All the most important things you need to provide for that child are free - and that is your time, your love, your energy,\" says Joe, \"and that's what my mum has done with Daniel. <br/>\"My mum's not a rich lady, she's not got loads of money, but she's got loads of love and loads of time and I think that's priceless.\"<br/>Watch Joe Swash: Teens in Care on Tuesday 11 July at 21:00 BST on BBC One.

But now the real challenge - logging and preserving all of it - begins.<br/>You might recognise California-based Danny from his YouTube channel NoClip, which has produced making-of documentaries about top games including Final Fantasy, Rocket League, Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us and God of War.<br/>His latest project began when a contact got in touch to tip him off about a media company in San Francisco sitting on a huge collection of tapes that he'd definitely want to see. <br/>It was about to throw them all out, but Danny had other ideas. <br/>So he rented a truck, and was soon driving boxes and boxes of tapes back to his studio. And that got him thinking. <br/>\"Sure enough, there were more and more of these collections that were just kind of sitting in these buildings, and were eventually going to end up in their own landfills or were just going to rot away.\"<br/>After contacting those others, Danny's now got stacks of cardboard containers stuffed with tapes of different shapes and sizes, including some super-rare professional formats. <br/>On each tape is a nugget of video game history from the late 90s up to about 2010 - and it's very unlikely that you'll have seen it before. <br/>\"A lot of this stuff was before YouTube,\" says Danny. \"So it was before any of us had high-speed internet. <br/>\"There's stuff like videotapes that were sent to video game websites or TV channels that were never meant to be shown.\"<br/>From just a few tapes pulled from a \"couple of random boxes\", he's already uncovered an interview with Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima and a tour of Call of Duty studio Infinity Ward featuring two developers who were later fired and went on to launch multiplayer shooter Apex Legends. <br/>Since then he's found other gems. <br/>\"A couple of days ago, I found a tape that had 'Nintendo Tour' written on it,\" he says. <br/>When he loaded it up, he found footage of an employee-only museum inside Nintendo's old USA headquarters.<br/>\"It's like 30 minutes of this room that none of us have ever seen, and doesn't exist any more,\" he says.<br/>Danny and the NoClip team plan to go through all the tapes and digitise them, turning the footage into files that can be uploaded online.<br/>But to do that they've had to level up their equipment inventory, as some of the tech needed to actually play some of the specialist tapes is rare and pretty ancient by today's standards. <br/>\"Finding ones that work today is incredibly difficult,\" says Danny. \"They cost a lot of money to buy and then shipping them is a nightmare because they weigh a ton.\"<br/>It's a challenge for a crowdfunded company that relies on donations to keep going, but Danny says dealing with different machines, cables and monitors is \"tough work\", but worth it. <br/>\"When you get the tape in these things and see it looking as good as it does, you can't buy that feeling,\" he says.<br/>\"Hidden in that collection, I know is going to be some stuff that's really going to shock and excite the larger video game world. <br/>\"So I'm excited for those big moments.\"<br/>And Danny, who's originally from Waterford, Ireland, says he's \"equally excited\" about smaller moments and awakening people's memories.<br/>\"Somebody's going to stumble across one of these videos, and it's going to be an old game they loved or they used to play with their cousin that they forgot about, right? <br/>\"If that person has that moment, where they watch that video, and they send the YouTube link to their cousin and go, 'do you remember when we used to play this?' <br/>\"That's why we do it.\"<br/>NoClip's putting all the footage on a dedicated YouTube channel and internet library archive.org. <br/>It's available to anyone, and he hopes other creators, documentarians and historians will use it in their projects. <br/>\"We hope that people interact with this stuff,\" says Danny.<br/>\"We've already seen people starting their own Twitch streams, where they watch a bunch of the videos or make their own YouTube video essays using this footage. <br/>\"But to me having a living, breathing archive, it's like a museum, there's no point having a museum if people aren't walking around it and interacting with the history that's there. <br/>\"We want people to check out the videos, share the videos, make their own art out of these videos and try and breathe new life into them.\"<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Is Kick really a threat to Twitch?<br/>Final Fantasy 16: Trying to regain fans' trust<br/>A gaming safe space with screams, jumps and scares<br/>Noclip<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Waugh later made several changes to the novel, including rewriting the ending and changing some names.<br/>The first edition of the Sherlock Holmes' adventure Hound Of The Baskervilles is signed with the comment: \"I perambulated Dartmoor before I wrote this book,\" a reference to the book's setting.<br/>Other highlights include rare and first editions of books by Agatha Christie, PG Wodehouse and James Joyce.<br/>\"He took great pleasure in owning these things,\" says Paul Sexton, who wrote Watts' authorised biography, Charlie's Good Tonight.<br/>\"He valued his time at home and he would read on the road, so literature was a very important part of his make-up.\"<br/>He added: \"I don't think he acquired them because he knew they would become valuable, he just took a huge satisfaction in owning these great works and tracking down, with the help of experts, original first editions.\"<br/>Books weren't the star's only passion. He also collected memorabilia from the American Civil War, antique silverware, vintage cars, drum kits and even a wardrobe of Edward VIII's Savile Row suits.<br/>But his life's biggest obsession was jazz. Growing up in Wembley, he and his lifelong friend Dave Green saved all their money to buy 78rpm records by Jelly Roll Morton, Johnny Dodds, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. <br/>One of his favourites was Walkin' Shoes by the Gerry Mulligan Quartet, featuring the drumming of Chico Hamilton, who Watts tried to emulate by taking the neck off a banjo and playing the body with wire brushes.<br/>He started collecting jazz recordings and related ephemera in his teens, and that only accelerated once the Rolling Stones started making money.<br/>\"He was hugely influenced not just by the sound of jazz, but the look of jazz, as well,\" says Sexton. <br/>\"If somebody was wearing a particular shirt on one of their classic album covers, then he had to have that shirt. It was completely informed by his almost hero worship of these musicians... because he just didn't think of himself as their equal.\"<br/>\"His love of jazz never left him,\" adds Green, who called Watts' collection \"truly astonishing\". <br/>Some of those items are now being sold by the late musician's estate, with a particular focus on his favourite saxophonist, Charlie Parker.<br/>Among the lots are Parker's Associated Musicians Membership Card, his contracts for the Alto Break sessions and a pair of Down Beat awards from 1952. <br/>George Gershwin's annotated score for Porgy and Bess will also be showcased, with an estimated price of \u00a310,000-15,000.<br/>Further Jazz lots include two scores by Irving Berlin - Songs from Top Hat and Songs from Follow the Fleet - inscribed to Ginger Rogers; and two inscribed piano scores by the influential cornetist Leon 'Bix' Beiderbecke.<br/>But while Watts was an avid collector of music memorabilia, he could never quite wrap his head around the idea of people buying Rolling Stones' artefacts.<br/>\"I think he thought they were a bit mad,\" says Sexton. \"He never bought into the mythology surrounding the Rolling Stones. <br/>\"At the end of the day, really, it was still a job for him - as much as it was one he was very proud of.\" <br/>The auction will take place in two parts, a live sale at Christie's headquarters in London on 28 September, and an online sale that runs from 15 to 29 September.<br/>Highlights will be put on display in Los Angeles from 25 to 29 July, New York from 5 to 8 September, and London from 20 to 27 September.<br/>Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts dies at 80<br/>Charlie Watts: Jazz man who became rock superstar<br/>In pictures: Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts<br/>Five of Charlie Watts' best drum beats<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

She's got a loyal fanbase who, if her Southampton show is anything to go by, turn up hours before it starts to guarantee a front-row spot.<br/>And at smaller venues they're also promised a much more intimate experience.<br/>\"I love the spontaneity of the shows; we take requests, we do Q&As and I can really talk to people,\" says Maisie.<br/>\"If someone heckles me, I can heckle them back... always politely though.\"<br/>As a musician who found her feet as a busker on the streets of Brighton, heckling is something Maisie's familiar with.<br/>She credits that period with making her a better performer, and giving her experience of a live audience.<br/>\"You learn a lot; how to engage a crowd as well as keep them engaged,\" she says. <br/>Maisie's latest album The Good Witch reached number one last week, making her one of the youngest British female solo artists to top the LP chart.<br/>As a self-proclaimed good witch, she jokes that she's always manifesting. <br/>Allow Instagram content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Instagram.

She's my hero. So I'm very honoured by the comparison.

As they say, the rest is history. <br/>Steps' debut single, 5,6,7,8, was released in 1997, kicking off more than 25 years of hits including Tragedy, One for Sorrow and Last Thing On My Mind.<br/>\"I packed up my artistic dreams in a box and put it on the top shelf,\" said Ian.<br/>\"I always knew I would open it up one day. And now's that time.\"<br/>This weekend his summer exhibition of landscape oil paintings opens at Cardiff's Adamo Gallery.<br/>Ian traces his love of art back to his childhood in south Wales' Rhondda Valley. <br/>\"My gran got me a watercolour set, I must have been about five or six, and I would copy beautiful Turner paintings of sunsets reflecting on water,\" he said.<br/>\"I adored my gran. She was just the best hugger and oh my god she would support me in every way. She was just gorgeous.\"<br/>His grandmother lived to see the early years of his rise to fame.<br/>\"She was super proud of 5, 6, 7, 8 and then she passed just shortly after that, but she got to see,\" he said.<br/>In later years a painting he had made as a child at his grandmother's dinner table was found, framed and now proudly hangs on his mother's wall. <br/>Life in Steps was a whirlwind with seven studio albums, seven compilation albums, thirty singles and five arena tours. <br/>Ian first picked up a paintbrush again about 10 years ago, but in 2016 became a father to twin boys Macsen and Cybi and his painting took a back seat.<br/>\"[I was] juggling lots of balls, spinning plates, it was tough and creatively I was drained,\" said Ian, 47.<br/>\"I was having to think about PE kits and swimming lessons and who's fallen today with a bump on their head, who's bitten who, I went through that phase - but now my kids are seven, they can clear up their own breakfast tray, they can dress themselves so I was in the right zone to make decisions that I wanted to kind of be creative again.\"<br/>The family live near Cowbridge in Vale of Glamorgan, and Ian recently organised the town's first Pride.<br/>\"I decided to be the change that I wanted to see. I want my children to grow up in a more diverse place,\" he said.<br/>Ian is also busy with Steps. Last year saw a string of summer shows to celebrate their 25th anniversary, the release of single Hard 2 Forget and their third greatest hits album Platinum Collection. Next month they headline at Brighton Pride.<br/>Life remains busy, but these days Ian's priority is his children and he has been able to settle into a routine of painting when the boys are at school.<br/>\"I'm at a place in my life now where I can juggle balls and manage them whereas before I lived and breathed Steps - now Steps isn't my life, it's my job now, my children are my full-time job and I get to paint around them,\" he said. <br/>He puts his easel and sketchbook into the back of his car, drop the boys at school and sees where the day takes him. <br/>\"I never have anything planned - I could go to Southerndown or Brecon or any beautiful location and I will be inspired,\" he said. <br/>He said he was endlessly inspired by the Welsh landscape. <br/>\"I'm spoilt for choice,\" he said.<br/>\"It's just so diverse, it's so beautiful, it's incredible. You've got mountains and lakes and hillsides and waterfalls, everything is right on our doorstep.<br/>\"I paint from real life, but I also love the spiritual elements to my paintings as well. There's a lot of me in my work.\"<br/>The world of fine art has at times been accused of being elitist. With his pop fame, has he experienced any snobbery?<br/>Gallery owners Sophie Usher and Richard Blunt had been \"very clever\" in the way they had put together the exhibition, he said.<br/>\"They haven't kind of played on the Steps card so people appreciate and like my work for my work,\" he said. <br/>Sophie said such was the appetite for Ian's paintings, some had sold even before the official opening. <br/>\"People are really captivated by how authentic the landscapes are,\" she said. <br/>Ian is thrilled with the reception to his work. <br/>\"I'm finally where I wanted to be,\" he said. <br/>\"All of the jigsaw pieces have slotted in at exactly the right time.

Not that they ever rest on their laurels. In fact, no living performer works harder than Springsteen to bridge the gap between the stage and the audience.<br/>He opened the set with No Surrender and Ghosts, two songs that testify to the power of rock and roll, as though he was summoning the spirits of live music.<br/>And from the off, he was untethered from the stage, running up and down the crowd barriers to pose for selfies, clasp people's hands, hand out plectrums and read their signs. More than once, he turned around to watch the E Street Band (now celebrating their 50th anniversary) from the front, apparently as big a fan as the rest of us.<br/>When he's on the stage, all the big rock star moves come out: He thrusts his guitar into the sky, or stands legs askance punching the air, all while wearing jeans tighter than cling film. <br/>Later, he sets up guitar duels with Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren, and rips open his shirt as he plays Dancing In The Dark.  It would be clich\u00e9d if he didn't deliver every moment with full-on, no-holds-barred passion.<br/>\"London is there anyone alive out there tonight?\" he hollers, in a well-worn moment of stage patter. \"'Cos if you're alive, then I'm alive. And that's what we came here for.\"<br/>For the first hour and a half, the music never stops. As soon as Springsteen strikes the last chord of The Promised Land or Out In The Street, there's a 1-2-3-4 and he powers into the next song. <br/>There are wonderful, extended jams on Mary's Place and Kitty's Back, where the band, the horn section and the E Street Choir, get to show off their considerable might; and rousing singalongs to The River and Because The Night - a song Springsteen gave to Patti Smith in 1977 but has latterly reclaimed as his own.<br/>The 28-song set is largely culled from Springsteen's biggest albums - Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town and Born in the USA - but while he focuses on the songs about buckling your seatbelt, turning up the radio and chasing the American dream, there's a second, more sombre thread to the show.<br/>Introducing Last Man Standing, he talks about forming his first band The Castiles, in the 1960s and how, 50 years later, he found himself at the deathbed of his guitarist George Theiss.<br/>\"He only had a few days left to live,\" Springsteen recalled, as the crowd listened in hushed silence. \"And I realised that his passing would leave me as the last living member of that band of guys that got together in that house so many years ago.<br/>\"Death brings a certain clarity of thought and of purpose and of meaning,\" he continued. \"Death's final and lasting gift to all of us is an expanded vision of this life. Of how important it is to seize the day, whenever you can.\"<br/>He then dedicates the song Last Man Standing, from his 2020 album Letter To You, to George, playing alone on stage without the rest of his band.<br/>Memories like those permeate the show. He covers The Commodores' Nightshift, a tribute to the late soul stars Marvin Gaye and Jackie Wilson, and flashes up pictures of departed E Street Band members Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons during Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out. <br/>And he ends the show alone again, strapping on an acoustic guitar to play I'll See You In My Dreams, another song inspired by the loss of a friend, his voice almost a whisper as he conducts the crowd in the final chorus: \"For death is not the end / And I'll see you in my dreams.\"<br/>It's a touching moment. A reminder of the transience of time, and the importance of keeping loved ones close. <br/>With Springsteen about to turn 74, there's a nagging feeling this could be the last chance to see Springsteen in full force. <br/>And yet, he shows no signs of stopping... or even ageing. There are artists half his age who couldn't pull off a show of this length and energy. We should savour every moment.<br/>Encore<br/>Bruce Springsteen plays a second night at the BST Hyde Park festival on Saturday, 8 July.<br/>Bruce Springsteen sells his music rights for $500m<br/>Blackpink make history with K-pop festival set<br/>Review: Bruce Springsteen's Broadway show<br/>Springsteen explores Irish roots in County Kildare<br/>Springsteen silenced at long gig<br/>Springsteen hits back at curfew<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But Chadwick succeeded by appealing for information in pubs near the writer's last home.<br/>He put up posters asking \"Do you remember Jack Hilton?\", which eventually led him to track down the widow of a friend, who was unaware she had inherited the author's estate.<br/>Chadwick then launched a campaign to get the book back into print, and it has now been signed by Vintage, an imprint of Penguin, the UK's largest publishing house.<br/>\"To use an appropriately northern expression, I'm chuffed to bits,\" Chadwick, 29, told BBC News.<br/>\"It feels like a victory not just for Jack, who struggled so much in his own time to get the recognition he deserved, but also for working-class people in the here and now, facing the same class ceilings.\"<br/>Hilton was a plasterer from Rochdale who based the vivid and groundbreaking book on his own experiences growing up in slums, living in workhouses after World War One, and suffering unemployment and hardship after the Great Depression at the end of the 1920s.<br/>Auden hailed his \"magnificent Moby Dick rhetoric\", while Orwell said Hilton's voice was \"exceedingly rare and correspondingly important\" and declared he had a \"considerable literary gift\".<br/>Orwell even asked to come and stay with Hilton in Rochdale to write his own account of English working-class life. Hilton didn't have room, but suggested a friend in Wigan instead. That led Orwell to write his landmark The Road To Wigan Pier, which was published two years after Caliban Shrieks.<br/>Chadwick said Hilton was \"a writer of great talent who came from nowhere to blow wide open the parameters of literary modernism\". <br/>Vintage described Caliban Shrieks as \"a masterpiece of both modernist and working class literature, [which] continues to speak as angrily and impassioned today as it did on its first rave publication in 1935\".<br/>Hilton went on to write several more books, but went out of fashion and out of print after World War Two, when one countess at a leading publishing house was said to have told him that \"the proletarian novel is dead\".<br/>Seven decades later, a tattered copy of the book caught Chadwick's eye at Salford's Working Class Movement Library.

Some research points to the tradition dating back to the 15th Century. <br/>\"Timothy Leary called it the 4,000-year-old rock 'n' roll band,\" says Rikki Stein, who helped organise their performances at Glastonbury this year. <br/>\"It's probably a bit of an exaggeration, but nevertheless it's been passed down from father to son from time immemorial,\" he tells the BBC.<br/>Stein first stumbled upon the Master Musicians of Joujouka in 1971. <br/>\"I was so blown away by what I found there, that I tore up my return ticket and stayed in the village for a couple of years.\" <br/>By then the musicians had already been discovered by American counter-culturalists Paul Bowles and William Burroughs, as well as British-Canadian artist Bryon Gysin. <br/>\"I just want to hear that music for the rest of my life,\" said Gysin, who added that he never let the sun go down without listening to the musicians. <br/>Brian Jones, who founded the Rolling Stones, recorded the Master Musicians in 1968. <br/>At that time, Bachir Attar was a shepherd boy from the village. <br/>He remembers the rock-and-roll legend arriving all those years ago: \"When Brian Jones came to the village, my little brother Moustapha came to me and said: 'Somebody come with big hair.' I ran and ran to see my father and I saw the man with big golden hair. I shook his hand and he looked great!\" <br/>Jones stayed for a night and a day but the music festival lasted for several days. <br/>\"I don't know if I possess the stamina to endure the incredible, constant strain of the full festival,\" wrote Jones on the album cover of his subsequent record, Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka. <br/>\"Such psychic weaklings has Western civilization made of us.\"<br/>The Master Musicians create their other worldly sound with traditional Moroccan instruments. The pipes are called ghaitas and there are two drums: the zowak and farad.<br/>\"When I play the music I feel very happy - like a bird,\" says Ahmed El Attar, sometimes referred to as the leader of the band.  <br/>\"That's why I want to play this music forever. If I ever feel angry or sad, I just listen to the music and suddenly I feel happy again. I feel like a bird, that is flying away,\" he tells the BBC.<br/>\"When you play the ghaita, you become part of a great sound,\" says another member of the troupe, Abdeslam Rrtoubi. <br/>\"I love seeing people moved by the music. It can also help me to play it on my own, whenever I need to calm myself. The audiences and the support we get from them with their dancing and their happiness is a gift to us.\"<br/>It takes years to learn the music properly. <br/>In fact, says El Attar, it takes a lifetime to master.<br/>\"When I was young I danced and started to play the drum. I have been playing music since I was a small boy of about nine,\" he says.<br/>\"When I was older I would be with the Master Musicians every day and the leader of the drummers, who was called Berdouz, helped me and other boys learn the music. It is not difficult if it is just your life.\"<br/>The sounds of Joujouka have their roots in Sufism but probably pre-date Islam. <br/>Half-way up a hill above the village is a cave. This is where the ancient deity Boujeloud is said to live. He is half-man, half-goat and probably related to the Greek god Pan. <br/>It is believed that Boujeloud brings the gift of fertility to Joujouka and he performs as the dance master, accompanying the musicians as they pound their drums and blow their pipes. <br/>In the old days a goat was slaughtered and skinned. Then a small boy would be sewn up inside a goatskin, smeared with salt. The blood, sweat and salt was said to inspire mystical visions. <br/>Nowadays the man inside the costume is Mohamed Hatmi, who runs a local caf\u00e9 in the village. <br/>But at night, during the annual festivals, he dances like a maniac and whips people with olive branches. It's comic but somehow disturbing. <br/>The village also has a shrine to a 15th Century saint, who brought Islam to Joujouka. <br/>\"In our village our saint is Sidi Ahmed Schiech,\" says El Attar, \"the music is his music. The music began with our saint and when we play it, he is in the music.\"<br/>In ancient times people who suffered from mental illnesses would be chained to a tree in the village and the musicians would blast their pipes within inches of the patient's face. Once released, it was claimed that they would walk away, cured. <br/>Today visitors come from as far afield as Japan and find dancing to the drums and pipes at the festival clears their heads and heals their souls. <br/>\"Joujouka music has baraka [blessings from God],\" remarks El Attar. \"The baraka comes from Sidi Ahmed Schiech. He was a healer and his sanctuary is a place people have visited since ancient times for healing. The instruments the musicians play and the place itself all heal people. People still come to be healed here and even when we are abroad people look for healing and help from us.\"<br/>But while there were 27 musicians in the 1980s, there are now only 11. Many of them are elderly and it is not clear if a new generation will emerge. <br/>So are the musicians worried that this sacred ancient tradition may die out? <br/>\"Some people ask us about this,\" says Rrtoubi, \"but we don't think this music can die. If it did, it would be a very bad thing. There are many changes happening in our village and in the world, but the children still love the music.\"<br/>\"The music of Joujouka cannot disappear from here because the children who go to school in the village learn the music and it's our heritage,\" says El Attar. \"If the music stopped in Joujouka, it would be as if there's no more music in the world.\"<br/>'Friends thought I was crazy, I'm just sick'<br/>African, Arab or Amazigh?

the Westminster government is sovereign at all times,\" she told the inquiry.<br/>\"And if there is a deficiency in the Northern Ireland administration then those people in Westminster with responsibility for Northern Ireland have a responsibility.\"<br/>She added: \"If there is a gap in resilience in part of the UK, surely that should concern the government of the UK.\"<br/>Baroness Foster used this platform to stress the absence of Westminster politicians in the running of Northern Ireland.  <br/>On several occasions she told the Covid-19 inquiry that the lack of input made Northern Ireland less resilient when the time came to facing a major health emergency.  <br/>Referring to the time as \"realpolitik\", Baroness Foster said in the absence of power sharing the responsibility lay with Westminster to \"step in\". <br/>Baroness Foster highlighted that in October 2016 a report from Professor Rafael Bengoa had recommended changes to the health service in Northern Ireland. <br/>She said that all parties saw this as a \"necessity\" but following the collapse of Stormont in January 2017 this was not implemented. <br/>Last week, Robin Swann, who served as health minister during the pandemic, told the inquiry a lack of reform and investment in the health service hindered its response to the pandemic<br/>Baroness Foster said she was proud of the response of the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the health service to the Covid pandemic, especially in the absence of ministers.<br/>However, she added that she was unsure if any amount of planning would have left Northern Ireland \"fit for purpose\" to deal with the Covid pandemic due to its scale and nature. <br/>\"The number one risk on the risk register across the UK was for a flu pandemic and what came towards us was not a flu pandemic but a very transmittable disease in the community,\" she said.<br/>\"Therefore the need to scale up and have the capability to deal with that was something we had to dig very deep into very quickly.\"<br/>Giving his evidence, former permanent secretary at the Department of Health, Richard Pengelly, rebutted any suggestion that nothing happened in the absence of Stormont minsters.<br/>He said that \"preparatory work\" continued but any strategic change required ministers in place. <br/>\"In that three-year period there were no issues about the work we were doing in the department as regards the development of our emergency response plan or emergency preparation that had a minister been in place, they would have landed on the ministers desk.\"<br/>The first phase of the inquiry is looking at how prepared the UK and the devolved institutions were for the pandemic.<br/>It plans to hold hearings until at least 2025, but updates and reports will be published by its chair Baroness Hallett as it continues.<br/>On Monday, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride told the inquiry there was \"no doubt\" the absence of ministers had a significant impact on Stormont's preparedness for a pandemic.<br/>He added Brexit also affected pandemic planning, with resources diverted to aid with implementing changes.<br/>There was also a \"very significant\" shortfall in resources and staff to deal with the response required, the chief medical officer said.<br/>Lack of ministers had 'significant' Covid impact<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Failed reforms hindered NI Covid response -

Scientists say the new scanning method could revolutionise medical research.<br/>Cancer Research UK said the new scanning technique had \"a wealth of potential\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Scanning a transparent mouse to reveal the body in unprecedented detail<br/>The researchers say the method reveals far greater detail than existing scanning techniques. In one of the first applications the team has detected cancerous tumours in the first stages of formation.<br/>Prof Ert\u00fcrk says this is important because cancer drugs have to be shown to eliminate tumours in mice before being tested on humans. <br/>\"MRI and PET scans would show you only big tumours. Ours show tumours at the single cell, which they absolutely can't\".<br/>\"Current drugs extend life by a few years and then the cancer comes back. This is because the development process never included eliminating those tiny tumours, which were never visible.\"<br/>Normally lab mice are given cancer and scanned with conventional scans to see how the tumour has progressed. They are then treated with the cancer drug being tested and then scanned again to see what if any difference the treatment has had.<br/>Prof Ert\u00fcrk's scanning method can only be used on dead mice, to give a picture of how much cancer has progressed, or potentially, whether a treatment has worked. He made mice transparent after they were given cancer and then scanned them using his new technique. Only a few mice would need to be made transparent to test the effectiveness of the drug.<br/>Dr Rupal Mistry, research information manager at Cancer Research UK, said:<br/>\"This exciting and unique scanning technique has a wealth of potential for building our knowledge of how our bodies work and what goes wrong in diseases like cancer. <br/>\"While researchers will only be able to use the technique to examine the bodies of deceased mice, it could tell us a lot about how cancer develops at the early stages of the disease. Being able to visualise tumours in the context of the entire body will also give researchers a greater understanding of the impact of different drugs and treatment.<br/>\"Advances in technology like this are essential to driving progress and will hopefully lead to new ways to detect, treat and prevent cancer.\"<br/>The cancer application, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, is just one of hundreds if not thousands to which the new scanning technique can be used to improve medical studies. It can enable researchers to see things they have never seen before.<br/>Mouse studies are often the starting point for learning about processes in the human body. But the new technique can be used on any animals. It could also be used to make human tissues and organs transparent, though it is unlikely to be used to make an entire human body transparent in the near future because there would be no medical advances that could be made from it at this stage.<br/>Creation of the transparent mouse involves removing all the fats and pigment from its corpse, using a chemical process. It ends up looking like a clear plastic toy, which is ever so slightly bendy. Its organs and nerves are all still inside it - but near invisible.<br/>While Prof Ert\u00fcrk's developed the process to make a mouse transparent five years ago, the scanning technique makes the most of it.<br/>He has found a way of adding other chemicals known as antibodies to highlight the parts of the mouse he is interested in studying under a microscope. Different antibodies stick to different types of tissue and so highlight whatever the researchers are interested in looking at.<br/>As well as highlighting cancerous areas, Prof Ert\u00fcrk's team has produced a suite of videos which enable researchers to fly through the mouse's nervous system, gut or lymph system. <br/>The scans have several advantages over what is available now.<br/>First, the researchers can study diseases in the context of the entire body, which gives them a much greater understanding of the impact of different drugs and treatments.<br/>The 3D images are also stored online, so researchers studying different parts of the animal or wanting to do the same experiment can draw from a library, rather than having to use another mouse. Prof Ert\u00fcrk believes that the technique could reduce lab animal use tenfold. <br/>Dr Nana-Jane Chipampe, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, is excited at the prospect of using the new scanning technique to study how cells develop in the human body. Currently she has to slice up tissues into very thin sections to study them under a microscope. Soon she will be able to see details in 3D.<br/>\"I can't wait to get my hands on it!\" she told me enthusiastically.<br/>\"It has the potential to identify new tissues, cells and diseases which will really help us understand the development of diseases.\"<br/>Her team leader, Prof Muzlifah Haniffa, is producing an online map or atlas of every cell in the human body. She says the new scanning technique will be useful for all kinds of medical research. <br/>\"Without a doubt, it will accelerate the pace of medical research,\" she said. \"Combining these cutting-edge technologies and building the human cell atlas will no doubt completely revolutionise medicine.\"<br/>Follow Pallab on Twitter<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Still, 5% of all Alzheimer's cases are in people under the age of 65.<br/>A much smaller number of people are affected in their 30s and 40s, usually because of a faulty gene passed down the generations.<br/>The only known risk factor for getting Alzheimer's at a young age is if close relatives also had early onset disease, and there is no known way of preventing it.<br/>The early onset form of the disease follows the same inexorable course as it does in older age - it affects memory, thinking skills and behaviour.<br/>Fiona Phillips mentioned she'd lived with months of brain fog before her diagnosis. <br/>Brain fog does not have a medical definition, but it is often used by people to describe a fuzzy head, poor concentration and struggling to think clearly or quickly.<br/>There is no proven way of stopping yourself from getting dementia, but you can tip the odds in your favour. <br/>Research estimates that one in three cases could be prevented by lifestyle changes, including:<br/>It is not completely clear why doing these things can help protect the brain. <br/>Do these lifestyle factors actually stop the process of dementia in the brain?

Humans are increasingly encroaching upon their habitats, adding to the risk of new pandemics, so scientists are studying bats for any clues about how to prevent any new outbreaks.<br/>Dusk is the witching hour at Accra Zoo. It is the time that the captive colony of straw-coloured fruit bats begin to stir and the best time they can be tested for different pathogens. <br/>A team of scientists from the University of Ghana's veterinary school is here to analyse the bat droppings, or guano. <br/>They are involved in an international effort to predict the next pandemic and even in the extreme heat of Ghana's rainy season, they dress up in full PPE. They enter the enclosure and spread a white tarpaulin out on the ground.<br/>Lead scientist Dr Richard Suu-ire has studied bats for many years. He explains that PPE is needed \"to protect you from any infection you may pick up within the cage but also to protect the bats from getting anything from us. So it's protection both ways.\"<br/>Much remains a mystery about these animals - the only mammals that fly - and their extraordinary immune systems. Somehow bats can carry many viruses but don't seem to get sick themselves. <br/>Ghana has joined countries like Bangladesh and Australia as part of a global project called Bat OneHealth, which investigates how pathogens are transmitted from one species to another and what can be done to prevent so-called spillover events.<br/>In light of the Covid pandemic, the bat-borne viruses being focused on in this research include coronaviruses.<br/>Warning: This article contains a picture of dead animals which some people may find upsetting<br/>Dr Suu-ire explains that they are testing for paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses in the bats. In humans, these viruses are more familiarly experienced as illnesses such as mumps, measles and respiratory tract infections. <br/>He describes the bats as \"reservoirs\" because they carry the infection without getting sick themselves.<br/>\"So we want to monitor and see what is going on.\"<br/>He says when they worked with the wild bat populations they did not detect Covid-19.<br/>Today, his team is also testing for superbugs in the bat droppings. The scientists have fed the bats pawpaw fruit and, once the bats have defecated on the tarpaulin, they take swabs of the bright orange droppings and store them in test tubes. <br/>The University of Ghana has been at the forefront of this new area of research, with this project being the first of its kind. However, there are still many gaps in scientific understanding. <br/>Ultimately, what they are trying to find out is whether there is any bacteria in the bat faeces which is resistant to antibiotics. <br/>Dr Suu-ire says: \"If there's any resistance we will then find out to which antibiotics they are developing resistance. In future we will try to isolate the resistant genes from these bacteria.\"<br/>This is not the only bat research going on at the University of Ghana. <br/>In the undergrowth of the university's botanical gardens, Dr Kofi Amponsah-Mensah is setting up a high green net, almost as if he is ready for a night-time game of badminton. <br/>These nets allow him to catch some bats temporarily which he then examines, measures and finally releases back into the wild. As an ecologist, he worries about how humans are increasingly encroaching into bat habitats.<br/>He points out that deforestation rates in Ghana are high, with a lot of mining destroying vegetation which is the bats' natural habitat. <br/>\"I think we are just using bats as scapegoats for areas where we have failed as people, because historically we didn't have a lot of these diseases emerging,\" he says.<br/>\"We are the ones encroaching into the bats' [habitat], you know, and messing around with the ecosystem. This obviously leads to more contact and then the likelihood of some of these diseases coming up.\"<br/>Any discussion of how humans interact with bats inevitably leads to the topic of bushmeat.  <br/>All kinds of animals are on sale at a bushmeat market down a disused railway line in central Accra. These markets are a pinch-point where wild animals, like bats, come into contact with people. This creates a risk these scientists want to get ahead of.<br/>It is certainly not a place for the faint-hearted. There are large rodent-type animals called grass cutters with long tails, and dead antelopes with their throats slashed - signs of the various ways in which they were hunted in the wild.<br/>The heat in the market is overwhelming as many of the women who work here are cooking on open stoves. In the corner of one stall, we see what looks like a saucepan lid full of shrivelled, straw-coloured fruit bats. According to Dr Amponsah-Mensah, they have been singed on a fire to remove the hair. <br/>Following the Covid pandemic, some experts have called for the banning of markets like these in case they help spread the viruses. Although Dr Amponsah-Mensah says he would not choose to eat bat himself, he feels conflicted about a total ban.<br/>He says that the trade in bushmeat is something that has been going on for thousands of years and that it's entrenched in people's cultures and histories, with many people preferring to eat bushmeat rather than beef or chicken. <br/>\"The trade is dominated mostly by women and for a lot of them, this is the only trade they know because it's been handed down from their grandparents to their mothers, and now they are in the trade as well,\" he says.<br/>\"So any attempt to ban bushmeat without really thinking about the complexity of the trade will really have serious implications.\" <br/>At the sterile high-security labs at the Noguchi Institute for Medical Research on the University of Ghana's campus, bat droppings from Accra Zoo will be analysed by Associate Professor of Virology Kofi Bonney. <br/>As he punches a secret code into an electronic keypad, he explains that these labs have negative air pressure to prevent any pathogens escaping.<br/>Since the pandemic, Prof Bonney and his team have found themselves busier than ever in the global effort to get ahead of any future virus outbreaks.<br/>Prof Bonney explains the growing relevance of the Bat OneHealth project: \"We should have the environment working together with the animals' sector and the human sector. We must set up systems that will pick up some of these viruses very early so that we can curtail the spread.<br/>\"Otherwise, once a virus inhabits the human system, it keeps circulating and there is a high tendency for the virus to change. As they change, they can develop the ability to become a more severe disease. So the best thing is for us to develop systems that can pick them up early.\"<br/>Experts worry that the frequency of zoonotic spillovers will increase with climate change.

But despite the prime minister's pledge there are still many questions.<br/>That answer is yes for recruitment, though with a caveat.  <br/>The plan is funded for the first five years but for 10 years after that there is an assumption that future governments will find the money to keep up with the required growth in training places. <br/>It is hard to believe a new administration would dilute NHS workforce growth and the training of thousands more doctors and nurses. <br/>But, never say never when it comes to public finances.  <br/>Expanding the number of clinical staff to the extent which is envisaged in the plan will eventually have a positive impact for patients - but retention will be a bigger ask. <br/>The plan's policies to improve morale and hang on to staff look a little vague. Recruitment will not achieve much if there is a continued exodus at the same rate as now.<br/>Recruit and retain have long been held up as the required twin-track approach for the NHS. <br/>Health think tanks and charities were queueing up to welcome the plan as it had adopted the policies called for by most experts.  <br/>Then again the enthusiasm must in part have been relief that at long last there was an NHS workforce plan after nothing comparable in the previous two decades. <br/>Modelling of future patient demand seems reasonable and health think tanks were invited to kick the tyres of the numbers. <br/>Productivity assumptions were included. Some of the medical Royal Colleges have noted the plan is ambitious and they want to see more detail.<br/>The idea of medical apprenticeships is radical with staff in other NHS jobs training to be doctors. <br/>But, the precise workings of this scheme will need time to work out.<br/>Pay is certainly the elephant in the room.  <br/>Most large organisations drawing up a workforce plan would have a section on appropriate remuneration to attract and motivate the best staff.  <br/>That is one thing NHS England can't do with its strategy. <br/>NHS pay is the preserve of the government and it is ministers who decide. Most of the NHS pay disputes have been settled but the doctors' campaign is far from over with further strikes planned. <br/>Health unions have long argued that the best way to hold on to staff is to raise wages at a time of acute cost of living pressures.  <br/>Senior management have had to stand on the side-lines of the argument and cope with the consequences of walkouts.<br/>In the short-term - no, when it comes to raising the number of doctors, nurses and other health staff.  <br/>It takes several years to train clinical professionals and the expansion of new places at medical schools and universities won't begin until the autumn of 2024. <br/>Implementation may be slowed if there are not enough experienced doctors and nurses to set aside time to run the training.<br/>Retention initiatives aimed at reducing the number of NHS staff quitting might make a bit of a difference over the next year or so. <br/>But, patients currently frustrated at not getting a GP appointment or are on a long waiting list for an operation probably won't notice.<br/>Planning the training of tens of thousands of health staff right through till beyond 2030 is admirable. <br/>There has been nothing comparable in recent years with only sporadic time-limited initiatives. <br/>But, what will the rest of the NHS look line by then? Will the service have kept up with the increasing burden of sickness linked to an ageing population? <br/>Will the public be willing to keep funding the NHS through taxation? Might payment for some services have been introduced? How much difference will technology and AI make? <br/>There is no long-term plan for investment in buildings and IT - in other words the hospitals and clinics where the new staff will work and the computers they will use. <br/>Perhaps the publication of a multi-year workforce plan will spur politicians to come up with broader strategies for health funding and reform over a decade or more.  <br/>But don't hold your breath.<br/>The NHS backlog: Who are the 7 million?<br/>NHS staff sickness hits record high in England<br/>NHS misses targets to tackle care backlogs<br/>NHS in England facing worst staffing crisis, MPs warn<br/>Ministers set out plan to train and keep more NHS staff<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But among the studies looking for this type of autoimmune reaction - where the body starts to attack some of its own healthy cells - not all have found evidence to support this theory. <br/>Another hypothesis is that exposure to some germs in childhood can help guard against a number of conditions, including diabetes. Some scientists believe it is possible that lockdowns and physical distancing during Covid meant many children did not get sufficient exposure to germs and missed out on this additional protection. <br/>Hilary Nathan, Policy Director at type 1 diabetes charity JDRFUK, said: \"This research reflects a life-changing reality for so many families here in the UK.\"<br/>She urged people to look out for the symptoms of type 1 diabetes: tiredness, thirst, needing to go to the toilet to urinate more often, and weight loss or increasing thinness - collectively known as the four Ts. <br/>\"Knowing these signs and getting an early diagnosis and swift treatment can be life-saving,\" she said. <br/>Theo, now 9, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes a year ago. It happened just a few months after he caught Covid. His mum, Jo, says it came as a shock: \"I didn't know anything about diabetes. <br/>\"I thought it was a misdiagnosis because he wasn't poorly with it. We're very lucky that we caught it early. <br/>\"You're trying to process that your child's going through this. You're being taught all these scientific facts about the condition...to keep them alive. If you don't do it, you know, there are severe consequences.\"<br/>Theo, who lives in Sheffield, now has an insulin pump and is managing his diabetes well. <br/>Dr Faye Riley, from Diabetes UK, said: \"Research worldwide has identified higher than expected numbers of diabetes diagnoses in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. This study adds to the evidence.<br/>\"Future studies that examine longer-term trends will be important to disentangle the impact of the pandemic from natural fluctuations in incidence of type 1 over time, as well as establishing the range of factors that could be behind any apparent rise.\"<br/>'I was living with diabetes without knowing it'<br/>Fears Covid could trigger diabetes surge in India<br/>JAMA Network Open<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

with death rates below historical averages. <br/>In the third year, death rates rose in many countries as they opened up again.<br/>Some of the largest rebounds we found were in countries like Germany, New Zealand and Norway, who had fared better in the first two years of the pandemic (and well overall). <br/>Norway had far fewer deaths than Sweden in the first year of the pandemic but over the three years the two countries look more similar. <br/>It is hard to read straight across from Scandinavian countries to the UK, cautions Prof Sridhar, arguing \"we'd never look like either Sweden or Norway\", and describing them as \"healthier, wealthier and more equal\" countries that are very different to the UK.  <br/>It would take many inquiries to tease apart the effect of all the possible reasons behind every nation's pandemic outcomes: preparedness, population health, lockdown timing and severity, social support, vaccine rollout and health care provision and others. <br/>But some argue that there are lessons for the UK that need to be learned even before we think about future pandemics. <br/>The UK's heavy pandemic death toll \"built on a decade of lacklustre performance on life expectancy\" says Veena Raleigh, of the King's Fund, a health think tank. She argues that government action to improve population health and turn that around has \"never been more urgent\".<br/>We collected data on deaths in five-year age groups and population estimates/projections from Eurostat, the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland, the Northern Ireland Statistics Research Agency, the Centre for Disease Control, United States Census Bureau and Stats NZ. <br/>We calculated the death rate in each age group and combined them to form an age-adjusted death rate using the 2013 European Standard Population. <br/>Some nations did not have the full set of age bands. For example, US figures used 10-year age bands between five and 24 and above 55. Broader age bands can exaggerate excess mortality figures like the ones we calculated, in the order of a percentage point.<br/>Additional journalism by Callum Thomson, Isabella Worth, Jana Tauschinski, Liana Bravo and Wesley Stephenson <br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

But vaping's helped millions of people to ditch traditional cigarettes.<br/>It's widely considered less harmful than smoking tobacco - and the UK government endorses vapes as a quitting aid.<br/>But what do you do when you want to take the next step and quit completely?<br/>The main reason vaping gets you hooked is nicotine - the same ingredient that makes smokers crave cigarettes.<br/>It's thought to be pretty harmless on its own, but is powerfully addictive. That's why vaping isn't recommended for non-smokers.<br/>Nicotine creates new receptors in the brain when it enters the body, and you quickly come to associate it with feeling good.<br/>So when you stop getting it you'll feel cravings. These tend to be worse in the first three to four days after your last dose.<br/>According to the NHS, other withdrawal symptoms, like bad moods, are likely in the early stages of quitting.<br/>There's no firm answer to this - it varies for each person - but there are some things we do know.<br/>It's technically possible to go \"cold turkey\" and suddenly stop vaping. But most people find this very difficult.<br/>Experts, such as the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT), generally recommend some sort of gradual approach.<br/>One tip for vapers is to reduce the nicotine strength of their e-liquid in two to four-week stages, working down to 0% solutions.<br/>This can be trickier with disposable vapes, which tend to come in higher strengths.<br/>But zero-nicotine versions are available, and the NCSCT says using one alongside your regular vape can help.<br/>Failing that, a temporary switch to a tank-style vape, giving you access to different e-liquids, might be better. <br/>Other reduction strategies include:<br/>Another option is Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) - patches, gum and sprays used instead of a vape.<br/>Nicotine pouches that go between the gum and lip are starting to appear on some shop shelves but these aren't currently recommended by the NHS.<br/>Like smoking, if you've been vaping a long time you're likely to have formed habits around it.<br/>Certain situations or times of day - triggers - will have got you used to reaching for your vape. <br/>This can be hard to snap out of, so it can help to figure out what they are.<br/>It's also a good idea to try and fill this time with something else to distract you, like exercise.<br/>If you are a former smoker, the NCSCT says it's worth keeping a vape on hand for emergencies.<br/>Because, if you do relapse, it's better than reaching for a cigarette.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>Free vapes to be handed out in anti-smoking drive<br/>Vaping - is it a risk-free option?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Personally, everyone gave their all but the system was not fit for purpose, was it?\"<br/>Mr Hancock replied: \"That's absolutely right.\"<br/>The former health secretary added: \"I bear responsibility for all the things that happened, not only in my department, but also the agencies that reported to me as secretary of state.\"<br/>The inquiry also heard from the former health secretary that medicines for intensive care were \"within hours\" of running out at the peak of the pandemic. <br/>He added that the only reason they did not was because of work done in 2019 in preparation for a no-deal Brexit.<br/>Mr Hancock said he had to overrule initial advice not to quarantine people being brought back from Wuhan early in the pandemic, and that everybody in the Western world missed that lockdowns would be necessary.<br/>He also criticised the World Health Organization (WHO) for giving advice which \"stated that we should not have lockdowns\".<br/>He said it was \"madness\" but he had to \"overrule\" initial advice not to quarantine people coming in from China. <br/>He also blamed the WHO for having \"written into the international health regulations that you shouldn't close borders\".<br/>Because there was \"no such thing\" as mass contact tracing systems as the pandemic took hold, Mr Hancock said the inability to test people in large numbers was \"terrible\".<br/>He also used the word terrible to describe the government having no idea whether care homes had the right protections in place. <br/>He said the government didn't even know how many care home residents there were at the start of the pandemic.<br/>However, he said the responsibility for ensuring the social care sector was prepared for a pandemic fell to local authorities, and he \"didn't have the levers to act\". <br/>The former health secretary was also repeatedly asked about the recommendations from Exercise Cygnus, a three-day test run in October 2016 to find out how prepared the UK was for a influenza pandemic. <br/>It concluded that the UK's plan was not sufficient to \"cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic\".<br/>The inquiry has seen evidence that only eight of the 22 recommendations made after that exercise had been fully addressed by the time Covid hit, with work on the other 14, including preparing the social care sector, still ongoing. <br/>He described Exercise Cygnus as \"flawed in its central assumption\" that a pandemic was a disaster that needed to be \"cleaned up\" rather than something that needed to be stopped or contained in the first place. <br/>He said: \"The doctrinal flaw was the biggest by a long way because if we'd had a flu pandemic, we still would have had the problem of no plan in place for lockdown, no prep for how to do one, no work on what, how best to lock down with the least damage.<br/>\"I understand deeply the consequences of lockdown and the negative consequences for many, many people - many of which persist to this day.\"<br/>Mr Hancock said that some of that work on the Exercise Cygnus had been paused because of the need to prepare the country for a no-deal Brexit. <br/>But he said that he was \"not convinced\" that, even if all those recommendations had been addressed, the country would have been in a better place to deal with Covid. <br/>As a result, the UK was \"better prepared in terms of supply chains,\" but the \"overall impact\" was hard to judge.<br/>\"I'm afraid it's impossible to know,\" he added. <br/>When Mr Hancock first arrived at the inquiry, a widow showed him images of her husband, who died from Covid.<br/>Lorelei King, 69, was holding two A4 posters, which she showed to the former health secretary as he stepped out of a black Jaguar.<br/>One poster displayed an image of Mr Hancock with Mrs King's husband, Vincent Marzello, who died in a care home in March 2020, aged 72.<br/>\"You shook my husband's hand for your photo op,\" the photo was captioned. The other picture showed Mr Marzello's coffin.<br/>Mr Hancock didn't respond as he walked in to the building.<br/>Mrs King told journalists: \"Care homes became charnel houses because there was no testing, there was insufficient PPE, but, most disastrously, it's because they discharged people from hospitals without testing them.\"<br/>She called on Mr Hancock to \"tell the truth\" to the inquiry, adding: \"The bereaved families deserve that much.\"<br/>Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-medical officer close to tears over Covid deaths<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

He is due to give evidence on Thursday along with Sir Patrick Vallance, who was the government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic.  <br/>At the same hearing, George Osborne said his spending cuts meant the UK was better able to cope with the pandemic. <br/>The former chancellor argued that without austerity Britain would have been \"more exposed\" and rejected claims his approach left the health and social care \"depleted\" ahead of the Covid pandemic. <br/>Last week Sir Michael Marmot, a professor of epidemiology at University College London told the inquiry that the UK had entered the pandemic with \"depleted\" public services. <br/>Asked by inquiry lawyer Kate Blackwell KC if he agreed with the statement, Mr Osborne said: \"Most certainly not, I completely reject that.\"<br/>He accepted more money could have been spent on the NHS, but said as chancellor he had to balance demands for resources from other public services.<br/>\"You can't just say we like public spending to be higher without explaining where you get money from,\" he told the inquiry.<br/>He said the public had elected the Conservatives to government in 2010 and 2015 knowing the party was planning to cut public spending. <br/>During the period, cuts were introduced in welfare spending, school building programs, local government, police, courts and prisons. There was also an overall squeeze on health spending. <br/>Mr Osborne - who was chancellor from 2010 to 2016 - said: \"If we had not done that Britain would have been more exposed, not just to future things like the coronavirus pandemic, but indeed to the fiscal crisis which very rapidly followed in countries across Europe.<br/>\"If we had not had a clear plan to put the public finances on a sustainable path then Britain might have experienced a fiscal crisis, we would not have had the fiscal space to deal with the coronavirus pandemic when it hit.\" <br/>The British Medical Association said Mr Osborne's \"denial\" of a connection between austerity and the impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable was \"staggering\". <br/>On Monday, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) produced a report which said austerity had led to unsafe staffing in public services leaving the UK \"hugely unprepared\" for Covid. <br/>During the one hour 20 minute question session, Mr Osborne was also asked about the Treasury's planning for potential national lockdown. <br/>He said the department had plans for an outbreak of influenza but added \"given what subsequently happened that was very small scale\".<br/>\"There was no planning done by Treasury - or any western Treasury - for asking the entire population to stay at home for months and months on end.<br/>\"If someone had said to you the UK government should be preparing for a lockdown that might last for months, then I have no doubt the Treasury would have developed schemes it did subsequently develop around the furlough and the Covid loans. <br/>\"Planning could have been done for a furlough scheme in advance - I'm not clear that would have made a better furlough scheme than the one we as a country actually saw.\"<br/>Earlier in the day, Sir Oliver Letwin, a senior minister in David Cameron's government, told the inquiry a rapid turnover of civil service staff hindered the government's ability to plan for pandemics. <br/>He also warned that the UK was \"wildly under-resilient\" and said there should be a minister \"solely devoted\" to the subject.<br/>Labour said the admissions were \"too little, too late\", adding the Conservatives \"cannot be trusted to protect the public from the emergencies of tomorrow\".<br/>Sign up for our UK morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.<br/>Ex-PM Cameron admits mistake over pandemic planning<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>Covid inquiry criticises government evidence<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

it was something bigger than that,\" Mr Whitworth said.<br/>And by end of January, people in public health had been very clear it had been \"an impending wave that was coming to UK\".<br/>\"For those of us who had memories of Sars, the parallels were something that gave us shivers\", Mr Whitworth added.<br/>Asked about the dangers of a virus being leaked, deliberately or accidentally, from a laboratory, Cambridge University fellow in emerging infectious diseases Dr Charlotte Hammer said she was aware of four incidents involving the Sars virus. <br/>But when it came to controlling an outbreak once it had started to infect thousands of people, the virus's origins mattered \"very little\".<br/>What is the UK Covid-19 inquiry?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss, in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe, in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered -

where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK. <br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

Now, with the FBI adding its voice, the politics and division behind the hunt for the truth are being laid bare.<br/>There are few scientific debates as divisive and toxic as the question of Covid's origin. <br/>While researching for the upcoming podcast I'm making for the BBC about it, I've heard virologists question the motives and professionalism of colleagues with whom they disagree over two alternative possibilities.<br/>They are whether the virus infected its first human in a Wuhan market, or in a Chinese government-controlled lab. <br/>\"I wouldn't want [him] to be doing that experiment,\" one eminent virologist said dismissively of another who had raised questions about the risks of the Wuhan scientists' work. <br/>Professional relationships have been damaged and friendships lost. Some have simply had enough. <br/>\"Nothing personal, but I'm not prepared to take part in anything that gives air time to the lab leak conspiracy horseshit,\" one virologist said to me when I invited him to take part in our series. <br/>It should be no surprise then that US intelligence agencies and government departments have also struggled to reach a consensus on Covid's origins.<br/>The recent news that the US Department of Energy has changed its intelligence assessment to conclude - apparently with low confidence - that the virus came from a lab, brings the number of agencies supporting that view to two. <br/>It had already been reported that the FBI had come to the same conclusion - with a \"moderate\" level of confidence - and now FBI Director Christopher Wray has spelled out in public that the bureau believes \"a potential lab incident\" was to blame.<br/>Four US intelligence agencies are said to still believe the evidence points to the virus coming from nature, and two remain undecided. <br/>The intelligence assessments are based, of course, on classified information.  The different agencies are part of what's known in the US as the \"intelligence community\", with each one drawing on different expertise and sources of information, from human intelligence to the work of government scientists.<br/>The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, for example, can call on scientific and technological know-how from the 17 national laboratories that are overseen by the department.<br/>The agencies' work can overlap but it's unclear how much they've collaborated on the question of the origin of Covid.<br/>There were claims during the days of the Trump administration that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national-level research facility known to have been studying and experimenting with coronaviruses, had become sick in November 2019, leading them to seek hospital treatment. <br/>But no details have been released about the sourcing of that intelligence.  <br/>And the US government has said the symptoms were consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses - making it difficult for anyone to independently assess the true relevance of the claim. <br/>In early 2020, the lab-leak theory's association with President Donald Trump led some to treat it as disinformation: a deliberate, even xenophobic attempt to deflect blame for his administration's own handling of the pandemic.  <br/>But there were scientific arguments too - with claims that an examination of the genetic structure of Sars-CoV-2 proved conclusively that it couldn't have come from a lab.  <br/>Later, others would argue that analysis of the early patient data around that Wuhan market where the disease first emerged went even further to prove a natural origin beyond all doubt - and we will hear from some of those scientists in our podcast. <br/>These scientists may wonder whether politics are once again at play in the timing of the comments from the FBI director, a Trump appointee, just as the Republican Party, now in control of the US House of Representatives, begins to turn its attention to the lab-leak once again.<br/>On the other hand, under President Biden the lab-leak theory has been largely freed of its associations with his predecessor.<br/>Which is perhaps why other scientists are increasingly willing to speak out about their concern that the theory may have been too swiftly dismissed. <br/>Professor Larry Gostin, from Georgetown University and an advisor to the World Health Organization \u00a0- although himself favouring a natural origin - does not believe there is yet enough evidence to definitively rule out a lab-leak and thinks it was a mistake to try to do so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"Science shouldn't discount the public interest like that,\" he told me. He suggests that Donald Trump, who has indulged in conspiracy theories across a range of other issues, may in fact have been right to question this narrative. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"I mean, yes, you do have conspiracy theories. But was he, you know, wrong in wanting that information about the lab? No.\"<br/>Some experts hope that Congress may now be able to uncover new information.  <br/>US scientists have collaborated closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and there may yet be data held by government agencies or research archives that could prove useful.  <br/>Meanwhile the Chinese government of course pushes back at any and all suggestions that the virus came from China - via a market or a lab.  <br/>My own attempts to examine those possibilities led, at least in part, to my forcible departure from the country, under threat of legal action by the authorities in 2021.  <br/>State media accused me of \"stigmatising China as being the origin of the novel coronavirus\" and of having \"maliciously incited hostility from the international community to China.\" <br/>The question of Covid's origin is likely to remain shrouded in bitterness, acrimony and politics in both Washington and Beijing.<br/>The lack of information is both why President Biden ordered his intelligence agencies in 2021 to use \"every tool\" to look again for answers, and also why they're finding them so hard to come by. <br/>John's podcast on the hunt for the origin of Covid is coming soon on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 4<br/>Covid origin likely China lab incident - FBI chief<br/>Covid origin studies say evidence points to market<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

I've accepted that advice. It is therefore with great hope that I declare Covid-19 over as a global health emergency,\" Dr Tedros said. <br/>He added that the decision had been considered carefully for some time and made on the basis of careful analysis of data.<br/>But he warned the removal of the highest level of alert did not mean the danger was over and said the emergency status could be reinstated if the situation changed. <br/>\"The worst thing any country can do now is to use this news as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built, or to send the message to its people that Covid-19 is nothing to worry about,\" he said.<br/>The World Health Organization first declared Covid-19 to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) in January 2020. <br/>This signalled the need for coordinated global action to protect people from the new virus. <br/>It will now be up to individual countries to continue to manage Covid in the way they think best.<br/>Vaccines were one of the major turning points in the pandemic. According to the WHO, 13 billion doses have been given, allowing many people to be protected from serious illness and death. <br/>But in many countries vaccines have not reached most of those in need. <br/>More than 765 million confirmed Covid infections have been recorded worldwide.<br/>The US and UK, like many other countries, have already talked about \"living with the virus\" and wound down many of the tests and social mixing rules. <br/>Dr Mike Ryan, from the WHO's health emergencies programme, said the emergency may have ended, but the threat is still there. <br/>\"We fully expect that this virus will continue to transmit and this is the history of pandemics,\" he said.<br/>\"It took decades for the final throes of the pandemic virus of 1918 to disappear. <br/>\"In most cases, pandemics truly end when the next pandemic begins.\"<br/>US to end Covid vaccine air travel requirements<br/>Covid whistleblower returns home to Wuhan after jail<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.<br/>After congratulating the then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson on delaying A-level exams for a few weeks - a shorter period than some teaching unions called for - Mr Hancock had some choice words. <br/>On 1 October 2020, Mr Hancock messaged Sir Gavin: \"Cracking announcement today. What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"<br/>Sir Gavin replied: \"I know they really really do just hate work.\"<br/>In response, Mr Hancock returned two laughing out loud and a bullseye emoji. <br/>Mr Hancock texted his old boss George Osborne, ex-chancellor and then-Evening Standard editor, on 28 April 2020 to \"call in a favour\" asking for a favourable front page, as he tried to reach his own deadline to reach 100,000 daily Covid tests. <br/>Mr Osborne replied: \"Yes - of course - all you need to do tomorrow is give some exclusive words to the Standard and I'll tell the team to splash it.\"<br/>After replying with a quote, Hancock later writes in capital letters: \"I WANT TO HIT MY TARGET!\"<br/>The editor answered bluntly: \"I gathered.\"  <br/>In another interaction, on 9 November 2020 Mr Hancock asked for an explanation about Mr Osborne calling for Boris Johnson to make testing his number one priority and insisted: \"OK but mass testing is going very well.\"<br/>\"No-one thinks testing is going well, Matt,\" Mr Osborne replied. <br/>Sir Gavin, messaging Mr Hancock, on 10 May 2020 ahead of schools reopening, asked for the health secretary's help in getting personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools \"as a last resort so they can't use it as a reason not to open\". <br/>The education secretary texted: \"All of them will [open] but some will just want to say they can't so they have an excuse to avoid having to teach, what joys!!!\"<br/>Boris Johnson had misgivings about the government's shielding advice in discussions with the chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. In August 2020 the then-prime minister suggested that if renewed lockdown restrictions were needed over-65s be offered a choice on shielding.<br/>Mr Johnson, addressing Sir Chris in a WhatsApp group on 9 August, said: \"If you are over 65 your risk of dying from Covid is probably as big as your risk of falling down stairs. And we don't stop older people from using stairs. What do you think?\"      <br/>Sir Chris conceded that he \"would think twice before shielding unless it threatened the NHS\". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance replied: \"We haven't found shielding easy or very effective first time round.\"<br/>Only a few days previously, shielding had ended for more than two million clinically vulnerable people in England, Scotland and Wales. Since March 2020 they had been advised to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid. Shielding later returned. <br/>Helen Whately, who was social care minister at the time, travelled 50 miles to a Covid test centre so a relative could be tested in September 2020, according to the Telegraph. There were restricted numbers of home testing kits and the public had to book a slot at a testing centre, where they could swab themselves and it would be sent to a laboratory. <br/>Speaking of the experience on 19 September, she messaged Mr Hancock: \"So my mystery shopping shows the system is definitely working, at least for some.\"<br/>Mr Hancock enthusiastically replied \"for MOST!\", despite UK labs struggling to keep up with demand and people being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. <br/>Mr Hancock clashed with Sir Gavin over whether to close schools ahead of their return January 2021. <br/>In private WhatsApp messages with a special adviser, he said he had to take \"rear guard action\" to ensure schools did not open, while the then-education secretary was battling to keep children in school. <br/>During a meeting on Zoom on 28 December 2020 to decide on the fate of students, Mr Hancock and his special adviser Emma Dean appeared to send each other messages commenting on the call, according to the Telegraph. <br/>Ms Dean said: He's [Sir Gavin] freaking out. You can tell he isn't being wholly rational.\"<br/>Mr Hancock got his way as schools closed days later amid a national lockdown.<br/>In an earlier exchange in September the pair took aim at Sir Gavin following the education secretary being forced to abandon A-level and GCSE students being given grades by algorithm. <br/>Replying to Ms Dean's suggestion Gavin looked awful and questioning if the education secretary was OK, Mr Hancock said: \"He needs a haircut and a holiday somewhere other than Scarborough!\"<br/>During the May 2020 drive to hit the 100,000 tests per day target, trucks full were bought from Amazon.<br/>Mr Hancock was worried the government could look \"flaky\" if it was accused of using them to pad the stats.<br/>But there was jubilation when the target was hit - not least from Gina Coladangelo, the aide with whom Mr Hancock had an affair.<br/>She messaged: \"Drinks cold in fridge at [Department for Health]. Feel free to open them before we are back [beer emoji]\".<br/>But problems continued. Mr Johnson admitted in June he was \"going quietly crackers\" over capacity, asking \"what is wrong with us as a country that we can't fix this?\".<br/>In September, Mr Hancock was advised to avoid an interview with Andrew Neil \"because he could go hard on testing\".<br/>One set of messages shows Boris Johnson getting in a muddle over statistics.<br/>He flagged a Financial Times article stating the global case fatality rate had fallen below 0.04. Mr Johnson wanted to know why the British death rate appeared to be much higher at 4%.<br/>Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick, chief medical officer Sir Chris, aide Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Mr Hancock all chipped in.<br/>When Mr Vallance eventually pointed out the FT figure is a probability, not a percentage, the PM replied \"Eh\" followed by another message reading simply \"?\".<br/>He offers \"five marks\" to whoever can explain the difference and asks them to \"show working\" - before Mr Cummings assures him it is a \"common confusion\".<br/>In the same exchange, Mr Johnson says he \"knows what I would prefer\" if he was 80 and given a choice between exposure to Covid-19 and \"destroying the economy\".<br/>A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.<br/>The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.<br/>Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.<br/>The controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.<br/>While many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.<br/>A classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.  <br/>But it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.<br/>\"That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.<br/>President Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\".<br/>In May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" their efforts on this.<br/>The issue is still hotly contested.<br/>A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.<br/>A team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Dr Peter Daszak: \"Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market\"<br/>But many have since questioned their findings. <br/>A prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.<br/>\"We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,\" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.<br/>They're not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.<br/>Even the WHO's own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\"<br/>And Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.<br/>China has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.<br/>Responding to Mr Wray's remarks, China's foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.<br/>The US intelligence community had a history of \"misdeeds\" involving \"fraud and deception\", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.<br/>China has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. <br/>The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine. <br/>Prof Shi Zhengli - often referred to as \"China's Batwoman\" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.<br/>Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting  the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.<br/>Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.<br/>Yes, and it's called the \"natural origin\" theory.<br/>This argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.<br/>Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more?<br/>That idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was \"likely to very likely\" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.<br/>This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.<br/>Nevertheless, following FBI Director Wray's remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.<br/>A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.<br/>\"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said.<br/>Prof Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy's conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan \"appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus\". <br/>Given the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.<br/>If the \"zoonotic\" theory is proved correct, it could affect activities such as farming and wildlife exploitation. In Denmark, fears about the spread of the virus through mink farming led to millions of mink being culled.<br/>But there would also be big implications for scientific research and international trade if theories related to a laboratory leak or frozen food chains were confirmed. <br/>Any confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.<br/>\"From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,\" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021<br/>\"We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that's required.\"<br/>But others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.<br/>\"We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can't do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,\" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore's National University Hospital, told the BBC.<br/>China hits back as US revisits Covid lab theory<br/>Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO<br/>Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.<br/>Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.<br/>Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. <br/>The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.<br/>According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.<br/>\n                        Percent of people fully vaccinated\n                    <br/>\n                            Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive\n                        <br/>\n                    This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. \n                <br/>\n                    Source: Our World in Data\n                <br/>\n                    Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST\n                <br/>Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. <br/>Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. <br/>Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.<br/>Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. <br/>Asia<br/>Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.<br/>North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. <br/>China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.<br/>In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. <br/>It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.<br/>Europe<br/>Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.<br/>In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. <br/>North America<br/>The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. <br/>However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. <br/>Latin America<br/>Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.<br/>Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.<br/>Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. <br/>In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.<br/>Africa<br/>Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.<br/>According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. <br/>South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.<br/>Middle East<br/>Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.<br/>The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. <br/>Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.<br/>In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. <br/>Oceania<br/>Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. <br/>So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.<br/>Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.<br/>In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.<br/>Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.<br/>It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.<br/>A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. <br/>The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.<br/>When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.<br/>Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas.

Instead, people are reporting more cold and flu-like symptoms. <br/>They looked at original Omicron - known as BA.1 and BA.2 - that was spreading in March 2022. <br/>Since then, two fast-spreading new subvariants of Omicron called BA.4 and BA.5 have dominated, causing more new infections. <br/>An estimated 2.7 million people in the UK, or one in 25, are thought to have Covid. <br/>Prof Tim Spector, who runs the Zoe Health Study, said: \"Covid is still rampant in the population. <br/>\"Even if people have had a past infection and are fully vaccinated, people are still catching it. <br/>\"Although we all want to make the most of the good weather, people will need to decide for themselves whether going to large events, working from the office or using busy public transport is worth the risk.\"<br/>Both the Zoe study and the React-1 study had been funded by the government until recently. <br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron: How worried should we be?<br/>Covid infections hit 2.7 million in UK<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?

The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. <br/>There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. <br/>The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.<br/>They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.<br/>They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.<br/>Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. <br/>In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. <br/>Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. <br/>Australia has reported cases too.<br/>Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. <br/>Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.<br/>But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.<br/>This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. <br/>Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. <br/>A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.<br/>As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. <br/>Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. <br/>They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. <br/>Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. <br/>Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.<br/>Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. <br/>Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. <br/>If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. <br/>The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. <br/>How many people have had boosters so far?<br/>Covid map: Where are cases the highest?<br/>Zelensky says Nato 'absurd' for Ukraine membership delay<br/>Sweden hails historic step as Turkey backs Nato bid<br/>Russian ex-sub commander shot dead while jogging<br/>'Europe or death' - the teens risking it all crossing Med<br/>Preparing N Korea's traumatised defectors for new lives<br/>Where did the Rocket Man end his mission?
