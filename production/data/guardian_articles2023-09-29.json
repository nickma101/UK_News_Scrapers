People are doing too muchA few years ago, I noticed that the vast majority of women I met at in-store beauty events were using far too many high-concentration products and suffering from irritation and a visibly compromised skin barrier as a result.

Quite the opposite, in many cases. A little glycolic acid gives glow, too much glycolic leaves skin even duller than before, for instance.

In that decade, there were very few female distance runners in Ethiopia compared with men. But I think what we\u2019ve seen in Ethiopia over the last 20 years is perhaps not an explosion but so many more women taking part, and training seriously.\u201d"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The Kenyan journalist Evelyn Watta agrees. \u201cIf you look at the political landscape in Kenya and Ethiopia, now we have more women in parliament and more women represented,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big statement and it certainly plays a role. We now have female athletics coaches coming up, and female administrators, too, which certainly helps."}, {"type": "text", "text": "\u201cSimple things such as discussing periods within Kenyan sporting society was taboo, but not any more. Even saying that an athlete is pregnant is a new thing, because it was very common in media circles to say: \u2018Oh she\u2019s injured.\u2019 You\u2019d ask: \u2018What kind of injury?\u2019 and they would say: \u2018Oh, a female injury.\u2019 So I think some small things are changing, and giving women the power they needed to show their best when they run.\u201d"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Another factor \u2013 especially in the marathon \u2013 is the age of athletes, which is dropping fast. \u201cWhen I started my career, the marathon was almost for retirees from track and field,\u201d says Watta. \u201cThey would do the 800m, maybe scale up to 5,000m and 10,000m, then the next thing would be the marathon and that\u2019s the end. Now, you are seeing much younger athletes going into the marathon. They are still strong, they are fresh, and I think that\u2019s also playing into the faster times.\u201d She says that the Kenyan runner Kelvin Kiptum was just 22 when he ran the fastest ever marathon debut in Valencia last year."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Why are they starting younger? Because, simply, the rewards are greater. These days, the top runners can get paid six-figure sums to compete in major marathons. Road running prize money has not only equalised \u2013 many used to offer lower prizes for women \u2013 but also gone up quite substantially. The winners at Berlin took home $50,000 (about \u00a341,250) in prize money, and that\u2019s before bonuses for breaking records and from their brand sponsors."}, {"type": "text", "text": "When Roger Bannister finally broke the four-minute mile in 1954, he remarked: \u201cApr\u00e8s moi, le d\u00e9luge.\u201d He was right \u2013 within weeks, his record was broken. In 2023, some might say it\u2019s more: \u201dApr\u00e8s les chaussures, le d\u00e9luge.\u201d But equally, some have questioned whether it is less tech-enhancement and more pharmaceutical-enhancement."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Certainly in recent years, a number of prominent Kenyans have been banned, including the former London marathon champions Jemima Sumgong and Daniel Wanjiru. But none of the current world record-holders have ever failed a drugs test, and certainly the way Kipyegon\u2019s fellow athletes enthusiastically celebrated all her three world records with her suggested that they are confident she has done it the right way. There will always be sceptics, but for Watta, it is a golden age for east African women in the sport: \u201cI know about technology and everything else, but deep down, as someone who\u2019s really followed athletics, I\u2019m excited because it shows that the talent is true. When I saw Assefa\u2019s time, I was pinching myself. I knew this would one day happen, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be in my lifetime.\u201d And the craziest thing of all is that the spate of world records may not be finished yet."}]}]
