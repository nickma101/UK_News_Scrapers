Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSoaring interest rates have caused household wealth in Britain to fall by more than \u00a32 trillion over the past year \u2013 the biggest fall since the Second World War, a think tank has warned.The Bank of England has engaged a rapid rate-rising cycle since late 2021 in a bid to tackle the inflation and restore order after Liz Truss government\u2019s disastrous mini-Budget.The rising base rate has caused mortgage rates to spike, house prices to fall and the price of government and corporate bonds to plummet.As well as causing pain for homeowners, falling bond prices have reduced the measured value of pension assets, normally the biggest single source of household wealth in Britain.New analysis by the Resolution Foundation suggests total household wealth had fallen to 650 per cent of national income in early 2023 \u2013 a \u00a32.1 trillion cash fall over the past year, and the biggest fall as a share of GDP in the post-war era.The Bank of England base rate currently stands at 5 per cent \u2013 but further rate rises are expected, with predictions the rate will go as high as 7 per cent next year in a bid to tame inflation.RecommendedTories fear triple by-election defeat that will sink Sunak government into \u2018malaise\u2019Starmer says he\u2019s happy to be branded a \u2018fiscal conservative\u2019 as he refuses to commit to greater public spendingBoris Johnson and the mystery phone that could unlock the secrets of Britain\u2019s Covid responseLabour has accused Rishi Sunak and his chancellor Jeremy Hunt of failing to do enough to ease the \u201cTory mortgage bombshell\u201d, with lenders\u2019 average two-year fixed rate mortgage deal already edging close to 7 per cent.Homeowners set to remortgage have been warned to prepare for a \u201chuge\u201d fall in disposable income after the\u00a0Bank of England said interest rates could cost an extra \u00a3500 a month to 1 million borrowers by 2026.However, the Resolution Foundation said rising interest rates could create some \u201cwinners\u201d among the younger generations, including aspiring first-time buyers and pension savers.Interest rates have put off some first-time buyers, but could create \u2018winners\u2019 in years ahead  (Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved)The think tank\u00a0argued that a \u201cnew normal\u201d of higher rates could end a 40-year wealth boom that has been a key driver of intergenerational inequality.Rising house prices have largely benefited older generations, while many younger people have been locked out of home ownership altogether, it said.The\u00a0foundation\u2019s Peaked Interest? report \u2013 part of a partnership with the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust \u2013 looked at what higher rates could mean for living standards and wealth accumulation in the future.Persistently higher interest rates could have two key long-term effects \u2013 lowering house prices and making it slightly easier to achieve a decent standard of living in retirement by raising rates of return on pension savings, the\u00a0foundation\u00a0said.Although rising rates are squeezing mortgage holders \u2013 and cutting off some first-time buyers in the short term \u2013 falling house prices could benefit young people hoping to get on the ladder in the years ahead.Bank of England governor has warned of mortgage pain ahead  (AP)The deposit barrier for first-time buyers could be reduced. Back in the mid-1990s, it would have taken a typical young, first-time buyer/couple around eight years to save for a 10 per cent deposit on an average first-time home. This figure has risen to 14 years, but could potentially fall back to around 10 years, the\u00a0foundation\u00a0suggested.While rising rates add to the cost of repaying mortgages, the\u00a0foundation\u00a0said this could be more than offset by a lower level of borrowing needed to buy a home, reducing the overall lifetime cost of property ownership for new buyers.Looking at pensions, the\u00a0foundation\u00a0said that in the pre-pandemic world, a typical worker would need to save around \u00a35,000 a year to achieve an income in retirement worth two-thirds of their income prior to retiring.But with higher interest rates, the same worker would need to save around \u00a33,000 to achieve that same standard of living in retirement, potentially making it easier for younger cohorts to save sufficiently to enjoy decent living standards in old age.Researchers also noted that the current rate-rising cycle could be a \u201cblip\u201d in an ongoing long-term trend towards lower interest rates. In such a scenario, wealth could continue rising and reinforce, rather than reverse, generational strains, they argued.Ian Mulheirn, research associate at the\u00a0Resolution\u00a0Foundation, said rapid interest rate rises appeared to have \u201cended\u201d the wealth boom. \u201cThose with significant mortgages will be hit by these major changes. But there are winners too from a shift to a world of higher rates and lower wealth.\u201dRecommendedUK finances in \u2018very risky\u2019 position after economic shocks, OBR warnsNadine Dorries set to earn extra \u00a322,000 from taxpayer by clinging to job over summerHe added: \u201cThe future path of interest rates is very uncertain. The current surge could be a blip, or herald a new era for the UK.

The document, titled Ancient and Modern Gems and Jewels, was published by Royal Collection Enterprises Limited in 2008. It has remained on its website since then and was only removed on Thursday after it was flagged by The Independent.The latest discovery comes after we revealed last week that an offensive racial slur was included in government documents. RecommendedDWP guidance on benefit assessments forced to be withdrawn over n-word slurN-word scandal grows as DWP launches probe into racial slur also used by Met OfficeRacist slur found on Foreign Office website days after government rejected need for reviewThe term was included in a report by the Met Office, as well as in Department for Work and Pensions guidance used by doctors to assess benefit claims. The slur had also been visible in the comment section of a page on the government\u2019s own website since 2015.The revelations prompted Rishi Sunak\u2019s official spokesperson to denounce the word as \u201cinappropriate and offensive\u201d.The document contains racial slurs in its descriptions of artefacts  (Royal Collection Trust)In the latest instance, the offensive terms are mostly used to describe people of African ancestry who appear on the jewels. The words are also included in a number of names of items in the collection.One brooch is described in the following terms: \u201cHead of a n***o in three-quarter profile to the right, with drop-pearl earring. This type of a n***o\u2019s head is found on several sixteenth-century cameos.\u201dAnother item depicting a white person is accompanied by this description and slur: \u201cAthough it uses the dark layers of the stone for the profile, the features are not n*****d\u2019.Some of the items in the collection have names that include racist terms  (Royal Collection Trust)An RCT spokesperson said the trust\u2019s documents were continually \u201cunder review\u201d.The RCT is one of the five departments of the royal household and is responsible for the care of the Royal Collection, the largest private art collection in the world, held in trust by the King on behalf of the nation. It sells tickets for tours of the King\u2019s official residences: Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh.This is the latest race row to hit the royal family. In November, the royal household faced a public outcry after Susan Hussey, the late Queen\u2019s lady-in-waiting, repeatedly asked a Black British charity chief executive where she \u201creally came from\u201d at a Buckingham Palace reception.Lady Susan, who subsequently left her role in the royal household, later met and apologised to Ngozi Fulani, founder of the charity Sistah Space.And the Duchess of Sussex, the first person of mixed ethnicity to marry a senior royal for centuries, claimed in 2021 that an unnamed royal \u2013 not the late Queen or the Duke of Edinburgh \u2013 had asked Prince Harry how dark their son\u2019s skin tone might be, before Prince Archie was born.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex during their interview with Oprah Winfrey (PA)The late Queen issued a statement at the time saying that the issues raised would be dealt with privately as a family, and that \u201csome recollections may vary\u201d.Prince William was also forced to deny that the royal family was racist following Meghan and Harry\u2019s bombshell televised interview with Oprah Winfrey, in which the claims were made.Racial terms such as n***o have been casually used in a non-pejorative sense throughout much of the 20th century across countries like the US and the UK. In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, such terms were interchangeably used with descriptive language like \u201cAfricans\u201d and \u201cslaves\u201d in reference to enslaved African people.However, such language is generally considered to be racist in modern times.Kim Johnson MP says the treatment of Black British people has its roots in historical racism  (UK Parliament)Labour MP Kim Johnson, a member of the all-party parliamentary group on race, said: \u201cThere are those who will say the use of such terms is innocuous \u2013 an accurate reflection of a bygone era. But every Black British person today is painfully aware of the legacy of such language, in terms of their ongoing treatment, institutional racism, and the policies of the modern British state. \u201cFrom the Windrush scandal, to a racist criminal justice system, to the use of racist terminology across current government policy documents \u2013 the treatment of Black British people as second-class citizens today has its roots in the very history this language was born out of.\u201dThe Royal Collection Trust is responsible for the largest art collection in the world  (Getty)Pan-Afrikanist Esther Stanford-Xosei, an expert on reparations with the International Social Movement for Afrikan Reparations, said the catalogue should instead have included guidance around the historical use of racially offensive terms while condemning the use of these terms and recognising their harmful impact.\u201cWe are in an era where it is well recognised that these terms are offensive and legally considered to be racial slurs,\u201d Ms Stanford-Xosei told The Independent.\u201cOne would expect institutions that have historical connections to African enslavement to have some type of guidance given around the language that is currently being used in this document. That the document uses colonial, racist, Afriphobic language, which denies the humanity, personhood and dignity of African people and their descendants, is a real cause for concern and totally unjustifiable.\u201dPan-Afrikanist Esther Stanford-Xosei has called the presence of racist terms \u2018totally unjustifiable\u2019  (Esther Stanford-Xosei)A Royal Collection Trust spokesperson said: \u201cRoyal Collection Trust has an ongoing programme of activities to research, display, loan and publish detailed records of objects in the Royal Collection, in order for a wide range of audiences to learn about the collection and its history.\u201cPublicly available object records are continually under review in order to improve the information presented on an object and/or subject.RecommendedRishi Sunak condemns n-word slur found in official DWP documentJamaica calls for end to UK visa restrictions and says becoming republic a \u2018priority\u2019Commonwealth representatives ask for reparations and apology ahead of coronation\u201cThe publication Ancient and Modern Gems and Jewels was published in 2008 and is now out of print.

It was claimed that her role at No 10 had been exaggerated as she was described as \u201cextraordinarily junior\u201d.A special committee appointed by lord speaker John McFall warned that episodes such as the controversy over Mr Johnson\u2019s list have \u201cbrought the appointments system into question\u201d.RecommendedTories fear triple by-election defeat that will sink Sunak government into \u2018malaise\u2019Boris Johnson and the mystery phone that could unlock the secrets of Britain\u2019s Covid responseNadine Dorries set to earn extra \u00a322,000 from taxpayer by clinging to job over summerThe senior peers said a \u201cfair and sustainable\u201d appointments system must be put in place \u2013 either by legislation or agreement between the parties \u2013 before a permanent reduction in the size of the Lords can be achieved.A reformed system is needed to end the \u201cratchet effect\u201d of incoming prime ministers nominating large numbers of peers to ensure they can get their business through the upper house, said the committee.They said the reforms would also have to tackle the imbalance in party representation \u2013 the chamber is currently dominated by Tories \u2013 as well as lowering the average age of members, and that there must be an end to hereditary peerages, which distort the political and gender balance of the House.Boris Johnson tried to give his strongest backer a peerage  (PA)Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to scrap the current House of Lords and replace it with an elected chamber of \u201cnations and regions\u201d. But Sir Keir is said to be drawing up plans to appoint dozens of\u00a0Labour peers to stop his legislative agenda from being frustrated.There are growing concerns about the size of the upper chamber, with its 779-member ranks set to be swelled by\u00a0Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list. There are 174 Labour figures in the Lords, compared to 263\u00a0Tory peers.The lord speaker\u2019s committee produced a plan in 2017 to reduce numbers on the\u00a0Lords\u00a0red benches from about 800 to 600 over the subsequent decade through a \u201ctwo-out, one-in\u201d system.But the latest report said that the failure to make progress since then meant that the size of the House was now a \u201csecond-order issue\u201d, to be addressed only after the introduction of a sustainable appointments system.The committee said the system should include a cap on the maximum number of peers, which is currently unlimited; a fixed-term limit \u2013 which could be 15 years \u2013 for service in the\u00a0Lords; and a fair allocation of new appointments based on recent election results.Charlotte Owen, a former No 10 adviser, was given a peerage at the age of 29  (Getty)The committee\u2019s fifth report also proposed new reforms to enhance the independence of the process of appointing non-political crossbench peers, describing the current system as \u201ca muddle\u201d.The report said that the presence of non-political members \u2013 such as scientists, medics, charity campaigners and artists \u2013 on the cross benches was \u201cone of the most distinct and valuable elements of the House\u201d.The House of\u00a0Lords\u00a0Appointments Commission (Holac) has since 2012 been restricted to two or three nominations of non-party peers a year, with the result that a large majority of crossbenchers are now appointed by the prime minister.The committee recommended that prime ministers are limited to a maximum of 10 of their own crossbench appointments per parliament, and that they increase the number of members they allow Holac to appoint.Noting that the current system had led to a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of Tories and a \u201csignificant\u201d under-representation of the opposition, the report concluded: \u201cDealing with this situation is important.\u201dRecommendedBen Wallace in \u2018parting shot at Suella Braverman\u2019 as he announces he\u2019ll quit as defence secretaryLord Burns, the chair of the committee, said: \u201cThe political leadership should focus initially on putting in place a sustainable and fair method of allocating appointments.

But the woman said she was struggling to keep a roof over her family\u2019s head at the time and was terrified of being taken to court, and is now unable to retire as planned.She called CICA a \u201cbroken service\u201d, and said the government \u201chasn\u2019t played their part to support or help us properly at all\u201d.More than 130 survivors from 11 different terror attacks shared their experiences for the survey, with many others saying they felt disbelieved, put \u201con trial\u201d and traumatised by being forced to relive horrific experiences.A young survivor of the Manchester Arena attack said her mother had \u201creceived more for a whiplash claim than I received for getting blown up in a bomb at my first concert\u201d.Another survivor of the bombing, who lost his partner and suffered life-changing injuries, said CICA demanded bank and medical records when he was recovering from a coma and several rounds of surgery.\u201cThe whole theme then and even recently is that they don\u2019t believe me, that I have to prove it all, like I\u2019m a criminal,\u201d he added.A survivor of the 2017 London Bridge attack said the compensation they eventually received was an \u201cinsult\u201d, while a victim of the 7/7 bombings said their award was reduced because of irrelevant decades-old criminal convictions, adding: \u201cI just feel like I was punished a second time after being blown up.\u201dA survivor of the London bombings said he was \u2018punished a second time\u2019 when his compensation was reduced because of a 20-year-old criminal conviction  (Getty)Overall, 68 per cent of people surveyed said the compensation process was unfair and unreasonable, 62 per cent did not feel treated with respect and empathy, and the majority found requests for \u201cproof\u201d of physical or psychological injury unreasonable.Survivors Against Terror called for the creation of a new compensation authority, overseen by the Home Office and \u201cproperly funded and staffed\u201d by people trained to deal compassionately with attack survivors.

They have been attacked \u2013 not because of who they are, but as proxies for the British state. Therefore, the British state has a responsibility to ensure that they are supported. It is failing in that duty.\u201dIn 2019, following a terror attack on a prison conference in London\u2019s Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, the government committed to consulting on a new charter guaranteeing survivors\u2019 rights, but the document has not been published.Then in 2020, it promised a dedicated compensation process for terrorism in the UK and abroad, but it has not emerged.

I\u2019ve spent well over seven years with three phones by my bed,\u201d he told The Sunday Times on his desire to leave Westminster.Mr Wallace is not going quietly, however, having become involved in a turf war with Ms Braverman about British soldiers being asked to cover for any gaps in Border Force staff this summer.The defence secretary has refused Ms Braverman\u2019s request for 750 troops to fill in for immigration officials who strike or are absent, according to The Mail on Sunday, claiming that the Home Office should have made contingency plans.A source told the newspaper: \u201cThe home secretary must not be allowed to always rely on our hard-working armed forces to be there to mop up for Home Office incompetence.

A Home Office source told the Mail that Mr Wallace \u201chas halved the number of troops he\u2019s willing to offer to help backfill jobs compared with the last round of strikes at Christmas\u201d.They added: \u201cNow an impending summer of chaos seems to be of little concern \u2013 but it is for the millions of people trying to use our airports. It\u2019s all so petty.\u201dSuella Braverman is said to want 750 troops to be made available to cover any strikes  (PA Wire)Mr Wallace said his departure was partly due to the strain the job had put on his family life.The senior Tory, who has separated from his wife, said: \u201cWhile I am proud to have worked with so many amazing people and helped contribute to protecting this great country, the cost of putting that ahead of my family is something I am very sad about.\u201dHe insisted that his exit was nothing to do with last week\u2019s row over his comments on Ukraine, when he said that the West was \u201cnot Amazon\u201d and that countries supplying weapons wanted to see more \u201cgratitude\u201d.Rishi Sunak said in response to those remarks that the Ukrainian president had \u201cexpressed his gratitude for what we\u2019ve done on a number of occasions\u201d. The defence secretary tweeted on Saturday that his comments had been \u201csomewhat misrepresented\u201d, saying he had meant that Ukraine \u201cneeds to realise that in many countries and in some parliaments there is not such strong support as in Great Britain\u201d.Asked if things were so \u201cbad\u201d for the Tories that even leadership contenders were quitting, trade secretary Kemi Badenoch said Mr Wallace should be \u201ccelebrated\u201d rather than \u201cworrying\u201d about his exit.She told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019m sad that he is stepping down, but I understand that public service is something that is very gruelling and draining. I think we should be celebrating Ben\u2019s public service rather than trying to link it to unrelated issues.\u201dBen Wallace wanted to succeed Jens Stoltenberg as secretary general of Nato  (PA Wire)Former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom also tried to play down the significance of Mr Wallace\u2019s departure, saying it was \u201ccompletely reasonable\u201d that he should want to step back. Ms Leadsom told the BBC that many MPs were getting tired of the \u201charassment on social media\u201d and \u201cvitriol in the press\u201d.Mr Wallace had expressed an interest in standing for the position of Nato secretary general before it was announced that the current chief, Jens Stoltenberg, had been given another year in charge.The popular cabinet minister \u2013 who will leave his role during a reshuffle expected in September, having told Mr Sunak last month of his intention to leave \u2013 suggested that he will continue to call for higher defence spending.Speaking to The Sunday Times, Mr Wallace went on to talk of his fears about future wars: \u201cTowards the end of the decade ... I think we will find ourselves in a conflict. Whether it is a cold or a warm conflict, I think we\u2019ll be in a difficult position.\u201dCiting the China situation and \u201ca total breakdown of politics in the Pacific\u201d, he added: \u201cYou could find yourself by 2030 in a position of cold war.\u201dFrequently topping the Tory members\u2019 poll of most popular cabinet ministers, Mr\u00a0Wallace\u00a0is the longest continuously serving minister in government, having been security minister before being promoted to defence secretary by Mr Johnson.Mr\u00a0Wallace\u00a0ruled himself out of the running for the Conservative leadership last year, despite being an early frontrunner in the race to replace Mr Johnson.RecommendedUK formally agrees to join major Indo-Pacific trade bloc, marking largest post-Brexit dealThe Wallace-Braverman row comes amid fears of more Border Force strikes.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe government is on track to break a key promise to build 40 new hospitals by 2030, a report by the public spending watchdog has found.Delays to projects mean the target is unlikely to be met, with work on buildings in the second cohort of the scheme yet to have started as of May, the National Audit Office said.Critics branded the findings \u201cutterly damning\u201d and accused the government of \u201cwoeful progress\u201d despite having tried to \u201cmove the goalposts\u201d to meet the deadline.In May, health secretary Steve Barclay told MPs there had been a change to the hospitals included in the programme owing to the need to urgently deal with some that were in danger of collapse.Some needed urgent repairs as they had been built with reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC), a lightweight material used up to the mid-1980s, he said.RecommendedNumber of patients waiting a year for NHS care rises by 15%Hospital consultants announce fresh strikes in pay disputeSunak to face crunch by-elections as Tories battle to keep seatsHe acknowledged that work may not be completed by 2030 for up to eight of the original group.The NAO said that the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had adopted a \u201cbroad\u201d definition of \u201cnew\u201d, including refurbishment of existing buildings as well as completely new hospitals.By the watchdog\u2019s analysis, 32 hospitals in England classed as new by the definition the government first used are set to be completed in 2030.In October 2020, the government stated that 32 of the schemes under its New Hospitals Programme (NHP) would count towards the 40 new hospitals commitment, while the other eight projects were already either \u201cin build\u201d or \u201cpending final approval\u201d.The government explicitly stated it would announce a further new eight schemes also to complete by 2030 in due course, the NAO said.Using the original definition, the NAO found that changes to the programme announced by DHSC in earlier this year mean that by 2030 the government expects to complete the following:\u2013 Eight pre-existing schemes within NHP, which do not count under the original definition and date back as far as 2010\u2013 24 new hospitals already within NHP\u2013 Five new hospitals that will replace hospitals that were built using RAAC, and which were announced in May 2023\u2013 Three new mental health hospitals, which were approved, and will be managed, outside of NHP.In May this year, construction was yet to begin on any in the second wave of building in the programme, including Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Shotley Bridge Hospital in County Durham and Derriford Emergency Care Centre in Plymouth, for which work was expected to start between 2022 and 2024.Staff shortages mean the design for a standardised hospital has also been delayed and will not be completed until May next year, the NAO said.\n\nThere are some important lessons to be drawn... These include strengthening the business case process to improve confidence on affordability and delivery dates, and improving transparency for key decisionsGareth DaviesThe approach to achieving key objectives at the lowest possible cost could also result in hospitals that are too small, according to the watchdog, as modelling assumptions may be unrealistic about the extent to which care in future will be provided outside hospitals.The government failed to achieve good value for money, with the scheme having cost \u00a31.1 bn by March this year and progress being slower than expected, the report said.The NAO made several key recommendations, including for announcements about major capital programmes extending over more than one spending review period to \u201cfully reflect known uncertainties\u201d.It also called for a reconsideration of assumptions that could result in future hospitals being too small.Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: \u201cThe programme has innovative plans to standardise hospital construction, delivering efficiencies and quality improvements. However, by the definition the government used in 2020, it will now deliver 32 rather than 40 new hospitals by 2030.\u201cDelivery so far has been slower than expected, both on individual schemes and in developing the Hospital 2.0 template, which has delayed programme funding decisions.

He had held the seat since 2015 when the Tories took it from the Lib Dems.Faye Purbrick, who sits on Yeovil Town Council and Somerset County Council, will be hoping voters look past the circumstances of the contest when ballot boxes open on Thursday.But it could prove an uphill struggle, says Lord Hayward.Another seat with a 20,000 majority, the constituency could well be turned yellow come Friday morning with Sir Ed Davey\u2019s Lib Dems hopeful of success for candidate Sarah Dyke.Held by former Lib Dem minister David Heath for more than a decade, the Somerset constituency contains a strong party base able to take advantage of the Government\u2019s troubles.\u201cUntil eight years ago, Lib Dems had every seat in Somerset,\u201d said Lord Hayward.\u201cThey lost them all in the great sweep of 2015. But they had all those all those seats in Somerset.RecommendedGovernment announces student numbers cap for \u2018rip-off\u2019 university degreesSelby, Somerton and Uxbridge by-elections: Key statisticsGovernment set to break promise of 40 new hospitals by 2030 \u2013 report\u201cSo they\u2019re building and they did very well in the local elections in 2022.\u201cSo they are building on a very strong base of Lib Dem support.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoris Johnson\u2019s controversial resignation honours list has \u201cbrought into question\u201d the current appointments system for creating new peers, according to a House of Lords report.A cross-party committee of senior peers said the former prime minister \u201cshowed no interest\u201d in reducing the number of peers during his three years in office and that the number of new appointments he made \u201cfar exceeded\u201d the target set by the upper House.The panel also noted that peerages were \u201cgranted predominantly to members of his own party\u201d by the former Conservative leader.In a report published on Monday by the Lord Speaker\u2019s Committee on the size of the House, the peers said: \u201cIn recent months, there have been further developments which have brought the appointments system into question.\u201cMost notably, there was considerable controversy over the size and composition of prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation list, with over half of initial nominees not being approved by the House of Lords Appointments Commission (Holac).\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe Lord Speaker\u2019s committee has recommended imposing a fixed-term limit, possibly of about 15 years, for service in the Lords and called for a fairer allocation of new appointments that are based on election results.It said reducing the size of the Lords had become a \u201csecond-order issue\u201d, with the priority to introduce a \u201csustainable\u201d appointments system, ideally via legislation or otherwise by consensus among the political parties.Peers in 2017 recommended the Lords be capped at 600 to make it smaller than the Commons.But it has continued to balloon, with the latest report suggesting there are 824 members, making it one of the largest scrutiny chambers in the world.The committee has reiterated its call for an end to by-elections for hereditary peers to help reduce the overall numbers and provide a better gender balance, given all 90 are men.The urgency around the reforms comes as peers consider the prospect of Labour winning the next general election, which is likely to be held next year, and needing to quickly increase the representation of Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s party in the second chamber due to it being currently outnumbered by Tory peers.The report follows a storm over Mr Johnson\u2019s exit honours last month in which he appointed seven new peers to the Lords.Former Tory London mayoral candidate Sean Bailey, who took part in a lockdown-busting Christmas party in December 2020 at Conservative Party headquarters, and Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen were among those given peerages.Mr Bailey, who has faced calls for his peerage to be blocked, has apologised for his attendance at the party.More than half of Mr Johnson\u2019s peerage nominations were not accepted by vetting watchdog Holac, with Conservative MPs and close allies such as former culture secretary Nadine Dorries and former Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams thought to have been among those blocked due to rules around not being able to sit in both chambers.Allies of the ex-premier accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of removing names from the final list but Downing Street denied the claim.Ms Dorries announced her intention to quit as an MP ahead of the list being published, although she has yet to formally resign.Mr Johnson and Mr Adams announced their decision to do the same shortly afterwards, with the former premier departing in protest after discovering a Commons probe found he had lied to MPs with his assurances lockdown rules were followed in No 10 during the pandemic.His honours list was not the first time Mr Johnson had been at loggerheads with Holac.In December 2020, Mr Johnson overruled the body to push through a peerage for Tory donor Peter Cruddas despite Holac saying it could not support giving him a seat on the red benches.Addressing a potential change of government, the Size of the House committee said Labour would be placed in a \u201cdifficult position\u201d if it were to win a majority at the next election given its 181 party-affiliated peers make up \u201cnot much more than 20%\u201d.Their average age is also 75, seven years higher than the Conservative group.Labour leader Sir Keir, who has committed to abolishing unelected peers, has remarked on the \u201cimbalance\u201d in the Lords and his spokesman has hinted that it could need to steadily appoint party peers to ensure it can get its legislative agenda through.The Lord Speaker\u2019s committee said gradual changes to the make-up of the House could ensure a party is not put in the same situation again.The committee suggested that new appointments should be allocated on the basis of an average of each party\u2019s share of their Commons\u2019 seats and the national vote at the most recent general election.\u201cThis would have a gradual impact on the political balance of the parties, reflecting each party\u2019s electoral fortunes over time while also allowing each party to refresh its own membership,\u201d the six-page report said.Lords Burns, chairman of the Size of the House committee, said: \u201cThe political leadership should focus initially on putting in place a sustainable and fair method of allocating appointments.RecommendedGovernment announces student numbers cap for \u2018rip-off\u2019 university degreesSelby, Somerton and

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRising interest rates could create some \u201cwinners\u201d among the younger generations, including aspiring first-time buyers and pension savers, according to a think tank.The Resolution Foundation argued that a \u201cnew normal\u201d of higher rates could end a 40-year wealth boom that has been a key driver of intergenerational inequality.Surging house prices and pension values have largely benefited older generations, while many younger people have been locked out of home ownership altogether, it said.The Bank of England base rate currently stands at 5% and further rate rises are expected as the Bank tries to quell stubbornly high inflation.There have already been signs of house prices dipping as rising mortgage rates cool the market.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe foundation\u2019s Peaked Interest? report \u2013 part of a partnership with the abrdn Financial Fairness Trust \u2013 looked at what higher rates could mean for living standards and wealth accumulation in the future.It said there could be winners, as well as losers, if higher rates are sustained.Persistently higher interest rates could have two key long-term effects \u2013 lowering house prices and making it easier to achieve a decent standard of living in retirement by raising rates of return on pension savings, the foundation said.Although rising rates are squeezing mortgage holders, falling house prices could benefit prospective house-buyers.Sliding property prices could reduce house price-to-earnings ratios to levels not seen since the turn of the century, according to the foundation, which is focused on improving living standards for people on low to middle incomes.The deposit barrier for first-time buyers could be reduced.Back in the mid-1990s, it would have taken a typical young, first-time buyer couple around eight years to save for a 10% deposit on an average first-time home.\n\nRapid interest rate rises have ended this boom and brought about the biggest fall in wealth since the war, of \u00a32.1 trillionIan Mulheirn, Resolution FoundationThis figure has risen to 14 years, but could potentially fall back to around 10 years, the foundation suggested.While rising rates add to the cost of repaying mortgages, the foundation said this could be more than offset by a lower level of borrowing needed to buy a home, reducing the overall lifetime cost of property ownership for new buyers.Looking at pensions, the foundation said that in the pre-pandemic world, a typical worker would need to save around \u00a35,000 a year to achieve an income in retirement worth two-thirds of their income prior to retiring.But with higher interest rates, the same worker would need to save around \u00a33,000 to achieve that same standard of living in retirement, potentially making it easier for younger cohorts to save sufficiently to enjoy decent living standards in old age.Report authors cautioned however that millions of people are still under-saving for their retirement, and that minimum contribution rates into pension schemes will still need to rise, but by far less than in a low interest rate situation.Researchers also noted that the current rate-rising cycle could be a \u201cblip\u201d in an ongoing long-term trend towards lower interest rates.In such a scenario, wealth could continue rising and reinforce, rather than reverse, generational strains, they argued.\n\nIn these turbulent times, when assets have tended to held by older generations, we may see rising interest rates reversing the growth in wealth gapsMubin Haq, abrdn Financial Fairness TrustIan Mulheirn, research associate at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cOver the past four decades wealth has soared across Britain, even when wages and incomes have stagnated. But rapid interest rate rises have ended this boom and brought about the biggest fall in wealth since the war, of \u00a32.1 trillion.\u201cThose with significant mortgages will be hit by these major changes. But there are winners too from a shift to a world of higher rates and lower wealth.\u201cHigher returns will make it far easier for younger people to save for a pension that delivers a decent standard of living in retirement, while lower house prices will make it easier for younger generations to get on the property ladder and others looking to trade up.\u201cThe future path of interest rates is very uncertain. The current surge could be a blip, or herald a new era for the UK. Either way, policymakers should focus more on whether and how to insulate households from wild swings in their fortunes from these forces well beyond their control.\u201dRecommendedGovernment announces student numbers cap for \u2018rip-off\u2019 university degreesSelby, Somerton and Uxbridge by-elections: Key statisticsGovernment set to break promise of 40 new hospitals by 2030 \u2013 reportMubin Haq, chief executive of abrdn Financial Fairness Trust, a charitable trust, said: \u201cThe short-term pain of higher interest rates for mortgage holders could also mean a longer-term gain for young people hoping to buy their own homes and saving for their pensions.\u201cBoth become more affordable and allow for a fairer sharing of wealth.

follow live\u2013 Selby & AinstyThis North Yorkshire constituency was created at the 2010 general election and has always been held by the Conservatives.Its former MP Nigel Adams took 49% of the vote in 2010 and pushed up his share at every subsequent poll, taking 53% in 2015, 59% in 2017 and just over 60% in 2019, when he won a majority of 20,137.Labour came second in 2019 with nearly 25% of the vote, with the Liberal Democrats a distant third on 9%.While Labour is the main challenger at this by-election, the party faces a tough task to win, requiring a swing in the share of the vote of 17.9 points \u2013 in other words, a net change of 18 in every 100 people who voted Tory in 2019 needs to switch sides.The last time Labour managed a by-election swing of this size or greater was nearly 30 years ago, when it won South East Staffordshire from the Conservatives in April 1996.There has been one official opinion poll in Selby & Ainsty since the by-election was triggered, putting Labour on 41% of the vote, the Conservatives on 29%, Reform on 8%, the Lib Dems on 6%, the Greens on 6% and the Yorkshire Party on 4%.However, opinion polls are snapshots, not predictions, and are based on only a sample of voters \u2013 in this instance, 502 adults surveyed between June 26 and July 6 by the firm JL Partners.\u2013 Somerton & FromeSomerton & Frome has a long history of being a two-horse race between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.The Tories held it from 1983 to 1997 and the Lib Dems from 1997 until 2015, when David Warburton won it back for the Conservatives.Mr Warburton had a majority of 19,213 at the 2019 election and took nearly 56% of the vote, with the Lib Dems second on just over 26% and Labour third on 13%.The Lib Dems need a swing in the share of the vote of 14.9 percentage points to come first at the by-election: the equivalent of a net change of 15 in every 100 people switching sides since 2019.This is a smaller swing than the party achieved when it defeated the Tories at the by-elections in Tiverton & Honiton in June 2022 (29.9 points) and North Shropshire in December 2021 (34.1).Mr Warburton sat as an independent MP between April 2022 and his resignation in June 2023, after losing the Conservative whip due to allegations of misconduct.No official polls have been carried out in this Somerset constituency since the by-election was called.\u2013 Uxbridge & South RuislipUxbridge & South Ruislip has been held continuously by the Conservatives since its creation in 2010.The Tories\u2019 share of the vote has gone up at each successive general election, from 48% in 2010 to 50% in 2015, 51% in 2017 and 53% in 2019.Former MP Boris Johnson first won the north-west London seat in 2015 and had a majority of 7,210 in 2019.Labour has always come second in this seat at general elections and polled 38% of the vote in 2019, with the Liberal Democrats on 6%.To win the by-election, Labour needs a swing in the share of the vote of 7.6 percentage points, or a net change of eight in every 100 people who voted Tory in 2019 switching sides.This is a smaller shift than the one achieved by Labour in the Wakefield by-election in June 2022, which saw the party win the seat from the Tories on a swing of 12.7 percentage points.It is also the lowest swing needed for a seat to change hands in any of the three by-elections taking place on Thursday.RecommendedGovernment announces student numbers cap for \u2018rip-off\u2019 university degreesGovernment set to break promise of 40 new hospitals by 2030 \u2013 reportMore same-sex honeymooners visiting places without marriage equality, says KuoniThere has been one official opinion poll of the electorate in Uxbridge & South Ruislip since the by-election was triggered, putting Labour on 41% of the vote, the Conservatives on 33%, the Lib Dems on 6% and the Greens on 4%.The poll was carried out by JL Partners among 502 adults between June 26 and July 6."}, {"_id": "64b4f27d51ac331ac5b7288e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/antarctica-adventure-aberdeenshire-southern-ocean-scottish-b2376311.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Brothers launch replica boats to circumnavigate Antarctica in \u2018world first\u2019", "lead": "The boats will collect scientific data during their trip which could take two years.", "author": "Lucinda Cameron", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:17.089659", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/00/15184145-095d22c7-6e1e-46a6-8505-d10e6809d0b7.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It\u2019s probably one of our hardest adventures.\u201cThis was by a long way the most involved and hardest adventure that we\u2019ve had to do.\u201cThe sheer amount of learning and skills the boys had to learn to make these boats, and to build them, and to test them, and the understanding of how all these things work, it\u2019s just a joy to see them learning in this way by doing stuff.\u201dHe added: \u201cBoth boys are absolutely delighted that the boats are in the water and we check a couple of times a day to see how they are doing.\u201dThe boys included masts and rigging when they built the vessels but these have been taken off for the voyage as they would not have withstood the conditions.Ollie, 13, said it is \u201cprobably one of our most challenging and ambitious adventures yet\u201d and is delighted that the boats are now underway on their journey.RecommendedGovernment announces student numbers cap for \u2018rip-off\u2019 university degreesSelby, Somerton and Uxbridge by-elections: Key statisticsGovernment set to break promise of 40 new hospitals by 2030 \u2013 reportHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing because it\u2019s taken over two years and the scientific data that could be collected as markers of climate change is going to be amazing, hopefully.\u201dAnyone wanting to see where the boats are, and find out more about the project, can do so at https://www.icoteq.com/project-erebus/"}, {"_id": "64b4f27d51ac331ac5b7288f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/british-medical-association-england-government-prime-minister-consultants-b2376310.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Hospital consultants announce fresh strikes in pay dispute", "lead": "Consultants in England, who will strike this Thursday and Friday, will also walk out on August 24 and 25, the British Medical Association said.", "author": "Alan Jones", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:17.318414", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/00/1192c148376888509a5ea047728ae847Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjA1NjA4-2.72981675.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Consultants have always been clear that industrial action is a last resort but in the face of a Government intent on devaluing consultants\u2019 expertise and their lack of regard for the impact this is having on the NHS, we have been left with no choice.\u201cWe\u2019ve had our pay cut year after year, put our lives on the line during a pandemic and now are managing a record backlog of care.\u201cThe Prime Minister says cutting these waiting lists is a priority but then undermines his own policy by showing he doesn\u2019t value those charged with delivering it. Cutting pay once again shows the Government\u2019s complete disregard for the profession.\u201cMeanwhile, there can be no better demonstration of the need to reform the pay review system for doctors than our pay review body recommending a further real-terms pay cut on top of the successive pay cuts over the last 15 years, at a point when the profession has been pushed to take industrial action and are leaving the NHS.\u201dRecommendedGovernment announces student numbers cap for \u2018rip-off\u2019 university degreesSelby, Somerton and Uxbridge by-elections: Key statisticsGovernment set to break promise of 40 new hospitals by 2030 \u2013 reportThe BMA warned that as well as next month\u2019s walkout, further dates will be announced in due course as consultants \u201care in this for the long haul\u201d.The announcement was made as junior doctors in England continued with a five-day strike which ends on Tuesday."}, {"_id": "64b4f27d51ac331ac5b72890", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/loveholidays-germany-holly-williams-tech-ireland-b2376305.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Loveholidays embraces AI to help its European expansion plans take off", "lead": "The group said AI paved the way for its launch in Germany and will help it achieve its aim to become Europe\u2019s biggest package holiday provider.", "author": "Holly Williams", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 23:01:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:17.576739", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T23:01:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/00/24143719-789d30ee-d64c-43d2-bc97-80ea32f1ae87.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

One of the most recent entries published in the ministers\u2019 transparency log shows that Mr Sunak took a private jet to the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt in November last year, costing the taxpayer \u00a3107,966.No 10 also published a photo of Mr Sunak boarding a private jet to Leeds earlier this year.PM boards an RAF jet for a trip to Leeds in January  (No 10/Flickr)Mr Sunak flew to Blackpool, Leeds and Inverness in the space of just a few days in January with the outbound flights from near London taking 41 minutes, 36 minutes and 90 minutes respectively. They would have produced more than 11 tons of harmful CO2 emissions, according to an estimate by the environmental charity Greenpeace.The equivalent one-way journeys by train would take around 2 hours 53 minutes, 2 hours 27 minutes and 8 hours 21 minutes and would produce a total of 59kg of CO2.The cheapest one-way tickets to Blackpool, Leeds and Inverness available on the morning of 7 July were for a combined cost of \u00a3234.20\u201cSunak\u2019s hugely destructive private jet habit has resulted in well over 150 times more carbon emissions than if he\u2019d taken the train for these short jaunts,\u201d Paul Morozzo, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace, said.\u201cThe optics are terrible. But as the prime minister\u2019s apathy towards tackling the climate crisis becomes ever more apparent, maybe the truth is he simply doesn\u2019t care. Why else would he use such an environmentally damaging mode of transport that saves a negligible amount of time?\u201dHe added: \u201cIf the UK is to retain its imperilled \u2018climate leader\u2019 status, Sunak must stop shunning public transport and set an example for us all to follow by banning the use of private jets, while investing heavily to improve rail and bus services making them better, more accessible and cheaper to use.\u201dMr Sunak previously defended his use of the jets, saying that they enabled him to make the best use of his time. More recently the PM has used helicopters for domestic travel, although he has paid for these himself or through cash from donors.Speaking at the Cop27 climate summit last year, Mr Sunak said it was \u201cmorally right to honour\u201d the UK\u2019s promises on reducing carbon emissions.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticePrince Andrew requested the help of his paedophile friend Jefferey Epstein to help secure $200 million (\u00a3153 million) in funding for an obscure oil company, it has been reported.The King\u2019s brother sought the assistance during a period when he was pictured with the financier in New York\u2019s Central Park back in December 2010, according to The Mail on Sunday.The Duke of York insisted in his car crash interview with the BBC that he met with Epstein only to terminate their friendship after the latter was jailed for child prostitution offences.But court documents, seen by the paper, reveal that Epstein passed on the prince\u2019s request to his private banker, Jes Staley.RecommendedPlans for Prince Andrew to move into Harry and Meghan\u2019s former home \u2018quietly shelved\u2019Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s island: What really happened there?Prince Andrew \u2018staying in Royal Lodge amid renovations in case he is evicted\u2019Epstein forwarded the query to Mr Staley on day one of Prince Andrew\u2019s five day stay at the New Yorker\u2019s \u00a360 million Manhattan mansion.The document states: \u201cOn December 2, 2010, Jeffrey Epstein forwards an email to Staley from Prince Andrew with an inquiry the Prince received from Aria Petroleum looking for a $200m working capital line.\u201cSince the company is based in the US, Prince Andrew appeared to suggest Epstein connect them with a US bank.\u201dThe court documents, which detail emails between Epstein and Mr Staley, were released as a result of a case filed against JP Morgan bank by the US Virgin Islands government.The bank, where Epstein was a client, is being sued over claims that it knowingly benefited from his sex-trafficking operation.JP denies any wrongdoing.The email appears to cast doubt on Andrew\u2019s claim that he visited Epstein to \u201cshow leadership\u201d by telling the billionaire in person he could no longer be his friend.The government would not be drawn on whether Andrew\u2019s request to Epstein was made as part of his role as trade envoy or if it wa sanctioned by ministers.Andrew stepped down from the position in 2011 after coming under heavy criticism for his association with Epstein.Epstein died on 10 August 2019 inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, where he was detained ahead of a pending trial accussed of recruiting dozens of teenage girls to engage in sexual acts with him and his friends in a case that generated headlines on both sides of the Atlantic,Epstein, who was facing up to 45 years in prison if convicted, was found with a noose made out of a bedsheet and the authorities ruled the death a suicide.Prince Andrew was dragged into the scandal when Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of Epstein\u2019s victims, claimed the duke sexually abused her knowing she was underage and was trafficked to the UK by Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who was jailed for 20 years for assisting Epstein.The prince has always vehemently denied the claims. He came to a multimillion-pound settlement with Ms Guiffree in a civil lawsuit.Prince Andrew was introduced to Epstein by Maxwell in the early 1990s and the trio enjoyed a close and mutually beneficial friendship, even after Epstein was convicted of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute in 2008.Prince Andrew stayed at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan for five days in 2010  (POOL/AFP via Getty Images)The court documents did not say where Aria Petroleum was based, what its business involved or how its relationship with Andrew.There were only two companies named Aria Petroleum operating in the US in 2010 they appeared to be local firms linked to petrol stations, the MoS reported.One, whose address is a petrol station and small grocery store in Florida, told the paper they had never had any contact with Prince Andrew or Epstein.The address of the second company, now dissolved, was a petrol station in Los Angeles.Documents leaked in 2021 said that a different company named Aria Petroleum \u2013 a UK-Cypriot oil trader \u2013 partnered with another firm to supply jet fuel to US forces in Afghanistan in 2012.Aria\u2019s UK arm was established in the same year and paid out a \u00a340.5 million dividend in 2018 but was shut down up two years later.RecommendedDeSantis presidential campaign is cutting staff as new financial pressure emerges\u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 debuts with $80M over five days, igniting box office but missing expectationsBrittney Griner makes an emotional and dominant return to record-setting WNBA All-Star GameThe firm\u2019s former directors could not be reached for comment.Prince Andrew did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}, {"_id": "64b4f28051ac331ac5b72899", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-trade-bbc-kuenssberg-badenoch-b2376148.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Badenoch clashes with Kuenssberg over post-Brexit trade deals: \u2018Stop interrupting me\u2019", "lead": "<p>Trade secretary lashes out at critics \u2013 claiming they were wrong to \u2018laugh\u2019 at the government</p>", "author": "Adam Forrest", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 14:30:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:20.201547", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T14:30:27+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/16/12/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free Brexit and beyond email for the latest headlines on what Brexit is meaning for the UKSign up to our Brexit email for the latest insight\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Oddly Uxbridge might be the least bad due to the Ulez issue.\u201dAnother Tory source said that if all three are lost everyone in the party would be in a \u201cbloody bad mood\u201d over parliament\u2019s summer recess and will spend it calling for various changes from Mr Sunak.Labour still faces a huge challenge in taking Johnson loyalist Nigel Adams\u2019 seat in Selby and Ainsty, which the Tories won by 20,000 votes in 2019 \u2013 but the party is quietly confident of a new record for Labour overturning a Tory majority.One senior Tory MP said they would lose Selby, but believes Uxbridge could still be won because of anger over Sadiq Khan\u2019s expansion of the ultra-low emission zone charges to outer London. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a referendum on the government, but on the mayor, Ulez and crime.\u201dRecommendedBen Wallace in \u2018parting shot at Suella Braverman\u2019 as he announces he\u2019ll quit as defence secretaryNadine Dorries set to earn extra \u00a322,000 from taxpayer by clinging to job over summerBadenoch clashes with Kuenssberg over post-Brexit trade deals: \u2018Stop interrupting me\u2019But others in the Tory party think the recent optimism that Mr Johnson\u2019s old seat of Uxbridge can be held \u2013 despite a majority of only 7,000 and anger at the former PM \u2013 is misplaced ahead of the contests on Thursday.\u201cI don\u2019t think Ulez has cut through enough in Uxbridge \u2013 we\u2019re losing that one,\u201d said a Tory source. \u201cWe could lose all three, but there\u2019s an expectation management game doing on. Selby can still be held, it\u2019s 50/50.\u201dTory peer Lord Hayward, the leading elections expert, also played down the Tories\u2019 chances of clinging on in Mr Johnson\u2019s old seat in north-west London, despite recent frustration over the Ulez scheme.Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves campaigning in Uxbridge (PA)\u201cIn Uxbridge, the expectation is that the Conservatives need to keep Labour\u2019s majority down \u2013 not that they will win,\u201d the peer told The Independent.The polling guru was also downbeat on the party\u2019s chances in Selby. \u201cA Labour person told me they think they have a better chance in Selby than Uxbridge. Labour believe they will win in Selby. And the Lib Dems are even more confident in Somerton and Frome.\u201dThe Liberal Democrats are optimistic of overturning a 19,000 to take the south-west seat. But a Lib Dem source insisted the result could be \u201cvery tight\u201d, as the party continues to appeal to Labour and Green supporters to consider tactical voting.Lord Hayward added that the by-elections were a chance for voters to express their \u201canger over the events of the past year\u201d \u2013 including Partygate and the disastrous mini-Budget.\u201cIf the party lose all three, it\u2019ll be viewed as part of the mid-term blues.

The driver kept telling Ms Njie to \u201cget out of my taxi, you Black n*****\u201d, the 39-year-old toldThe Independent, before stopping the car at a red light, forcing her to disembark \u2013 including removing her suitcase from the vehicle \u2013 and driving off.\u201cMy entire life turned upside down and I thought, \u2018I need some answers here\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I contacted [local authorities], the MP, councillors... and the more questions I was asking and the more people I spoke to, it became clear that not much has been done [to manage racism], and people are suffering in silence.\u201d\u201cI was being told there are systems and tools and forums in place, but I couldn\u2019t really see the actions, initiatives, or the evidence to show they were doing something about it.\u201dRecommendedCEO praised for refusing to leave airline seat to let mother sit next to her childrenLand temperatures in Spain surpass 60C as deadly heatwave sweeps EuropeEurope heatwave 2023 \u2013 live: Greece in emergency weather measures as map shows deadly \u2018Cerberus\u2019 heatSo Ms Njie decided to take matters into her own hands. Eight years later, the chair of grassroots campaign group Inclusive Equal Rights UK (IERUK) has won council approval for a five-year action plan that \u2013 if successfully implemented \u2013 would make York the first \u2018anti-racist and inclusive\u2019 city in the north of England. But after the plan - which can be read here - was announced, the campaign group received a \u201cbarrage of racist abuse and hate on social media,\u201d she says.  \u201cWe will not let you re-write our history for the benefit of Africans who are relative newcomers,\u201d were among the offensive comments made online. Another post about the group\u2019s data-led initiative read: \u201cPresumably this is code for ethnically cleansing York of white people.\u201d Addressing the backlash, Mr Njie clarified: \u201cWe are not saying that all of the people of York are racist or that York is a racist city, Our evidence-based research has demonstrated that the city has some serious issues of casual and systemic racism.\u201dYork \u2018has serious issues\u2019 of systemic racism, Ms Njie said  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)She said the action plan to make access to infrastructure and opportunities in York more equitable is inspired by similar programs in cities such as Oxford, Brighton, and Derby that all declared themselves to be anti-racist cities. As of the 2021 census, York had a population of 202,400 with 14% from ethnic minorities. Despite this, every member of City of York Council is white and the group\u2019s research uncovered other stark inequalities. \u201cSome of the most disturbing data we received was around policing, including figures that showed that Black people are 90 times more likely to be stopped and searched,\u201d Ms Njie said. \u201cAsian people are 18 times more likely to be searched than their white counterparts.\u201d Police data shows instances of recorded racial hate crimes in York and North Yorkshire increased by 239 per cent, from 152 incidents in 2012 to 515 in 2020. In response, IERUK has formulated 12 action points for policing reform as part of their 52-page report, which includes reviewing Stop and Search policies, monitoring outcomes of Stop and Search incidents, and establishing mandatory cultural, sensitivity and unconscious bias training, and organising events geared towards improving community relations. The Independent has contacted the North Yorkshire police force for comment on these proposals. But it is not just a matter of improving the community\u2019s relationships with one institution. IERUK highlighted that 68 per cent of Muslims live in areas with the highest rates of unemployment, Black women are four times more likely to die from childbirth than White women, and that Roma, Gypsy and Traveller people face high levels of racial assault and poor health. \u2018I think we have a real opportunity \u2013 history in the making \u2013 to change and review everything [in York] so it becomes more equal, to benefit everyone,\u2019 Ms Njie says  (Lorne Campbell / Guzelian)So the group has looked at other sectors such as healthcare, housing, and social welfare as part of their efforts to develop the action plan, in partnership with the Institute for Social Justice at York St John University. IERUK\u2019s plan was approved at a cross-party council meeting on 13 July where the next steps, including agreeing on a detailed plan of delivery and instructing officers to carry out the steps identified, were outlined. In a statement, City of York councillor Katie Lomas said: \u201cWe very much value the work done by IERUK, and the independence that they bring to this work.\u201cWe recognise the challenges for organisations across the city of ensuring a genuinely anti-racist environment, and we are happy to restate our commitment to becoming the North\u2019s first Anti-Racist city,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe would encourage people and businesses across the city to consider how they can support that ambition.\u201dRecommendedOlder and disabled people urged to \u2019embrace all the benefits\u2019 of free bus passesLouisiana judge tosses some charges against officers in deadly arrest of Black driver Ronald GreeneAP News Digest 5:30 a.m.There\u2019s always the risk that organisations, institutions, and people may not be willing to commit their time and resources to implement IERUK\u2019s ideas, Ms Njie said as she reflected on the challenges ahead for IERUK. But she hopes the campaign will drive change, and not be forgotten. \u201cI think we have a real opportunity \u2013 history in the making \u2013 to change and review everything [in York] so it becomes more equal, to benefit everyone.\u201d "}, {"_id": "64b4f28251ac331ac5b728a1", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/jeremy-vine-bbc-huw-edwards-twitter-gary-lineker-b2376224.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jeremy Vine agrees deal with Twitter user who wrongly named him in presenter row", "lead": "The broadcaster requested the social media user pay charity MND Association instead of paying him damages.", "author": "Ellie Iorizzo", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 16:29:05", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:22.146069", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T16:29:05+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/16/17/76cd163355f487d80d883f72dc39a170Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjA4NDgy-2.72988535.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

His job meant he was likely skilled in using a knife.He repeatedly assaulted his wife, fearing she was cheating on him, and was eventually arrested after attacking her and his mother with a \u201cchopper\u201d.Mr Hyams was described by witnesses as a man in his mid-thirties with a stiff arm and an irregular gait with bent knees.Ms Bax Horton discovered that the medical notes of Hyams, who was 35 in 1888,\u00a0 recorded an injury that left him unable to \u201cbend or extend\u201d his left arm.He also had an irregular gait and an inability to straighten his knees, with asymmetric foot-dragging, the medical records showed.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeArch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage has blamed EU rules \u201cmadly adopted\u201d by the UK for being denied accounts with several banks.The former Brexit Party and Ukip leader sparked a major row last month after claiming his account with Coutts was shut down because he was a \u2018politically exposed person\u2019 (PEP).It followed suggestions made in the Commons that Mr Farage, who has appeared on Russia Today in the past, had received more than half a million pounds from the Kremlin-backed broadcaster.Coutts, a private bank servicing high net-worth individuals, was understood to have closed Mr Farage\u2019s account due to a lack of funds.RecommendedBanks should be clearer on how customers can challenge account closures \u2013 Which?Nigel Farage\u2019s bank accounts were closed \u2018because of a lack of money, not Brexit\u2019Watchdog should prioritise probe into how banks treat politicians \u2013 ministerWriting in The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Farage, who said several other banks had denied him accounts, claimed he was the victim of over-zealous anti-money laundering regulations.\u201cAnti-money laundering rules appear to have been wildly over-interpreted by the compliance departments of banks in the UK,\u201d he wrote in the Brexit-supporting newspaper.\u201cNobody can deny that money laundering is a problem, he said. \u201cYet a series of agreements, EU directives and UK rules established to confront this menace have almost entirely failed to do so.Farage has appeared on Russia Today in the past  (Getty Images)\u201cBanks now live in fear of receiving huge fines. Their default setting seems to be to close down the business and personal accounts of anybody who is deemed to require extra due diligence \u2013 be they the owner of a window cleaning firm or a pawnbroker.\u201dHe added: \u201cThose who are paid in cash are no longer welcome; the compliance costs of servicing these accounts makes them unprofitable.\u201dMr Farage initially claimed that his account with Coutts, which acts on behalf of the royal family, had been closed in an \u201cestablishment\u201d-orchestrated revenge mission for Brexit, sparking a free speech row.Andrew Griffith, the city minister, wrote to the UK\u2019s financial watchdog urging it to prioritise an \u201cimportant\u201d review into whether people are being denied bank accounts due to their political views.The former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage claimed he was the victim of over-zealous anti money laundering regulations (Yui Mok/PA) (PA Archive)Mr Griffith, in a letter to Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said the \u201cstrength of concern\u201d on the issue meant it needed to be prioritised by the watchdog.No 10 also waded into the row, with a spokesperson saying there had been \u201cconcerns\u201d at the highest level of government and that the Treasury was looking at whether banks were overstepping the mark by closing some accounts.But sources at Coutts insisted Mr Farage\u2019s accounts were closed because he fell below the financial threshold Coutts requires.They told the BBC he was even offered a regular account at NatWest \u2013 which owns Coutts \u2013 which Mr Farage confirmed to The Independent.Coutts requires clients to maintain at least \u00a31m in investments or borrowing, or hold \u00a33m in savings, to be eligible for an account, the BBC reported.Mr Farage, who says he has been with the bank since 1980, suggested another reason his accounts may have been cancelled was his status as a so-called politically exposed person (PEP), which carries extra costs for banks.Sources at Coutts claim his accounts were closed because he fell below the financial threshold (Kirsty O\u2019Connor/PA) (PA Archive)But sources familiar with the bank\u2019s thinking told the BBC this was not the reason his accounts were closed and that it was a \u201ccommercial\u201d move.Coutts said it would not comment on individual clients.Mr Farage, first announced that his account had been in a video on Twitter, said that the \u201conly explanation\u201d he could think of for his bank\u2019s decision was a claim made by senior Labour MP Chris Bryant in the Commons that the former Brexit Party leader had received almost \u00a3550,000 from the television network Russia Today.\u201cI simply point out that Nigel Farage received from Russia Today \u00a3548,573 in 2018 alone \u2013 from the Russian state,\u201d said the MP.But Mr Farage said Mr Bryant\u2019s claim was \u201ccompletely false\u201d. He said: \u201cI did not receive a penny from any source with even a link to Russia.\u201dTwo former Brexit Party MEPs, Christina Jordan and Henrik Overgaard-Nielsen, have also claimed that their bank accounts have been shut down without explanation in recent years.According to the House of Commons Library, PEPs are individuals around the world with \u201cprominent public functions\u201d.RecommendedSunak rules out any new EU trade deal that undermines Brexit freedomsTory MP broke rules over \u00a3150,000 loan from Russian businessmanWhat is the future of the Conservative Party?The law recognises the risk of PEPs abusing their positions for private gain and using the financial system to launder the proceeds of this abuse, it says.PEPs, as well as their families and close associates, must therefore go through enhanced scrutiny when using the services of certain firms that act as \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 to the financial system, such as banks."}, {"_id": "64b4f28651ac331ac5b728b4", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/trevor-phillips-sophy-ridge-sky-equality-and-human-rights-commission-itv-b2376105.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "New host to replace Sophy Ridge on Sky\u2019s Sunday morning politics show announced", "lead": "The programme returns in September after summer recess.", "author": "Ellie Iorizzo", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 08:48:53", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:26.676113", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T08:48:53+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/16/09/16090730-0f8599e6-2d1b-4b7b-819c-fb0e87ebc8bc.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeGoogle is today marking the birth anniversary of American scientist Eunice Newton Foote, who laid the foundation of climate change awareness as early as the mid-19th century, as well as being an advocate for women\u2019s rights at a time when they were widely shunned from the scientific community.On what would have been her 204th birthday, the search engine celebrated Foote as the first person to recognise the significance of greenhouse gases in climate change, saying she \u201cplanted the seed\u201d of climate science more than one hundred years before it would start to emerge as a major discipline.Born in 1819 in Connecticut, Foote attended the Troy Female Seminary in New York, a school that encouraged girl students to attend science lectures and participate in chemistry labs. By the time she was a teenager she had developed what would be a lifelong passion for science.Her journey towards making her own groundbreaking contributions began in the early 1850s, when she became curious about the effect of sunlight on different gasses.Experimenting with glass bell jars filled with different fumes, she discovered that the cylinder containing carbon dioxide experienced the most significant heating effect in the sun.RecommendedWhy is there no UK heatwave as Europe swelters during Cerberus?Live: Rescue crews attend scene of flooded South Korea underpassRescuers evacuate 14,000 people from flood-hit villages in eastern PakistanPredicting that an increase in carbon dioxide levels could lead to global warming, she found that certain gases such as CO2 had the ability to trap heat from the sun and increase the temperature of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.She became the first scientist to make the connection between rising CO2 levels and the warming of the atmosphere.\u201cAn atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature; and if, as some suppose, at one period of its history, the air had mixed with it a larger proportion than at present, an increased temperature from its own action, as well as from increased weight, must have necessarily resulted,\u201d her paper noted.After publishing her findings, she produced her second study on atmospheric static electricity, which she called \"electrical excitation\". She published it in the journal Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.These were the first two studies in physics ever published by a woman in the US.Her paper, titled \"Circumstances Affecting the Heat of the Sun\u2019s Rays,\" was presented by a male colleague due to the prevailing gender biases of the time in 1856. He introduced her paper by stating that: \"Science was of no country and of no sex. The sphere of woman embraces not only the beautiful and the useful, but the true.\"Her findings ended up causing a stir among the scientific community and paved the way for wider discussions and experiments that uncovered what became known as the greenhouse gas effect.In addition to her groundbreaking contributions to climate science, Foote was also a passionate advocate for women\u2019s rights.Joining forces with prominent activists such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B Anthony, they campaigned for women\u2019s suffrage and equal rights.RecommendedWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?The startling and grim discoveries unearthed by the climate crisisEarth\u2019s CO2 hits highest recorded level in human historyShe was the fifth signatory of the Declaration of Sentiments \u2013 a document that was signed by 68 women and 32 men to demand equality for women in social and legal status.However, her scientific contributions were largely forgotten for many years and belatedly received the recognition she deserved in life after her death, when here observations were rediscovered in 2010."}, {"_id": "64b4f28851ac331ac5b728b9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/europe-heatwave-weather-2023-latest-news-b2376359.html", "primaryCategory": "Europe", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Europe heatwave \u2013 live: Charon sees temperatures soar again as record could be broken", "lead": "<p>A new anticyclone dubbed \u2018Charon\u2019 advanced into the region from north Africa </p>", "author": "Holly Hales and Stuti Mishra", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:03:15", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:28.029889", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T06:03:15+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/16/10/6d14df654dd04a048f66bce82b406560.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "\u2715CloseEuropeans seek shade as heatwave grips much of the continent\nFor free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Government is failing to support sustainable farming, which undermines the UK\u2019s food security, researchers have said.Analysis from the think tank Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has found that droughts, rising temperatures and increasing numbers of pests and disease \u2013 all features of climate change \u2013 are plaguing UK food producers.It said there is an urgent need to transform the UK\u2019s food system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and halt the destruction of nature, which as a result would improve farmers\u2019 ability to produce food.Food poverty, as well as wastage, is also damaging the health of the UK public and its environment, and the Government needs to take a leading role in transforming the system, the researchers said.Post-Brexit trade deals are undermining UK farmers and the country\u2019s climate goals while offshoring the UK\u2019s carbon footprint, they added, while supermarkets are dominating the market, buying at discount and selling at high volume, leaving producers with too little of the final price paid by the consumer.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019

hand in handLesley Rankin, IPPRIPPR researcher Lesley Rankin, co-author of the report, said:\u202f\u201cThe climate and nature crisis poses one of the greatest risks to the UK\u2019s domestic food production and the UK Government has consistently failed to treat this threat with the urgency it deserves.\u201cIf we are serious about ensuring food security and leaving our environment in a better state than we found it for generations to come, it is crucial we act immediately and involve farmers and communities every step of the way.\u201cThe evidence is crystal clear: protecting our planet, boosting farmers\u2019 livelihoods and food security go hand in hand.\u201cNow it\u2019s on the Government to act to put us on a path that provides a better life for us all.\u201dAs part of their investigation, the researchers spoke with farmers from three counties \u2013 Cumbria, Kent and Somerset \u2013 to get a picture of the challenges and opportunities they face.They said nature-friendly practices are having a positive impact on their businesses as well as the environment, but the Government is not adequately supporting farmers in making a sustainable transition.Environmental Land Management Schemes (Elms) are currently replacing the old system of farming subsidies, which paid farmers an amount of money related to the size of land they worked without regard for its impact on nature or climate.The new system is designed to reward farmers for switching to more nature-friendly practices such as maintaining hedgerows, but the IPPR said the schemes are failing to win the confidence of farmers with concerns that public money is not being spent effectively enough.The IPPR also said that Government regulation is failing to penalise the worst polluters because it has underfunded the Environment Agency by nearly \u00a31 billion over the last 12 years.They want a \u201crobust intervention\u201d from the Government, which would provide \u00a32.4 billion a year in support for farmers in England over the next decade to help them improve nature and eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.Trade deals should also ensure that imported food aligns with UK standards on environment, welfare and safety as well as workers\u2019 rights.And food partnerships should be set up in local areas to increase the market for healthier food that is also more beneficial to nature and the climate, the researchers said.\n\nThe Government must provide long-term financial support for the transition, and strengthen trade policy to guarantee environmental and worker standardsLuke Murphy, IPPRLuke Murphy, co-author of the report and head of the fair transition unit at IPPR, said: \u201cThe lack of a Government strategy for our food and farming sector has serious consequences.\u201cIt\u2019s undermining our ability to produce food domestically, making farmers\u2019 lives harder, and entrenching a food system that is wasteful, bad for our health, and damaging to the environment.\u201cThe Government must provide long-term financial support for the transition, and strengthen trade policy to guarantee environmental and worker standards.\u201cIt must protect British farmers from being undercut by food produced to lower standards abroad.\u201dA Government spokesman said: \u201cWe are committed to backing our farmers so we can grow our economy, protect nature and deliver the food security that is needed.\u201cWe have embarked on our next steps to deliver this, by committing to maintain the \u00a32.4 billion annual farming budget and investing in

One of the most recent entries published in the ministers\u2019 transparency log shows that Mr Sunak took a private jet to the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt in November last year, costing the taxpayer \u00a3107,966.No 10 also published a photo of Mr Sunak boarding a private jet to Leeds earlier this year.PM boards an RAF jet for a trip to Leeds in January  (No 10/Flickr)Mr Sunak flew to Blackpool, Leeds and Inverness in the space of just a few days in January with the outbound flights from near London taking 41 minutes, 36 minutes and 90 minutes respectively. They would have produced more than 11 tons of harmful CO2 emissions, according to an estimate by the environmental charity Greenpeace.The equivalent one-way journeys by train would take around 2 hours 53 minutes, 2 hours 27 minutes and 8 hours 21 minutes and would produce a total of 59kg of CO2.The cheapest one-way tickets to Blackpool, Leeds and Inverness available on the morning of 7 July were for a combined cost of \u00a3234.20\u201cSunak\u2019s hugely destructive private jet habit has resulted in well over 150 times more carbon emissions than if he\u2019d taken the train for these short jaunts,\u201d Paul Morozzo, a senior campaigner at Greenpeace, said.\u201cThe optics are terrible. But as the prime minister\u2019s apathy towards tackling the climate crisis becomes ever more apparent, maybe the truth is he simply doesn\u2019t care. Why else would he use such an environmentally damaging mode of transport that saves a negligible amount of time?\u201dHe added: \u201cIf the UK is to retain its imperilled \u2018climate leader\u2019 status, Sunak must stop shunning public transport and set an example for us all to follow by banning the use of private jets, while investing heavily to improve rail and bus services making them better, more accessible and cheaper to use.\u201dMr Sunak previously defended his use of the jets, saying that they enabled him to make the best use of his time. More recently the PM has used helicopters for domestic travel, although he has paid for these himself or through cash from donors.Speaking at the Cop27 climate summit last year, Mr Sunak said it was \u201cmorally right to honour\u201d the UK\u2019s promises on reducing carbon emissions.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeIn some respects, it was merely a confirmation of the inevitable; in another, an indication of the dramatic pace of change Erik ten Hag has brought to Manchester United. Harry Maguire had barely returned to pre-season training when he was informed he was being stripped of the captaincy.Which, as he finished last season as the fifth-choice centre-back, behind not just Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane but also Victor Lindelof and left-back Luke Shaw, may simply feel logical. Especially as United are open to offers to Maguire, as Gareth Southgate has warned he needs to play to retain his England place and as there is little prospect of him upturning the pecking order at Old Trafford. It may have been another way of ushering him towards the exit.Yet it completes a two-year unravelling: Maguire had been the endearing underdog, the former Sheffield United and Hull player who had become an unlikely national hero \u2013 \u2018Slabhead\u2019, the ungainly surprise star of a run to the 2018 World Cup semi-finals, then the world\u2019s most expensive central defender, then an anointed successor to Bobby Charlton and Bryan Robson, Roy Keane and Nemanja Vidic.After the rapid rise came the precipitous fall from grace. Ten Hag often praised Maguire\u2019s attitude; off the field, he was a fine ambassador last season. On the pitch, however, he lost his place after August\u2019s 4-0 embarrassment at Brentford; just when it seemed Maguire may at least rehabilitate himself as a decent deputy, he was horribly culpable for United\u2019s Europa League exit at Sevilla. As with David de Gea, another supposed talisman who was at fault then, this summer has brought an end to an era.Maguire\u2019s problems arguably date back to the summer of 2021; a few weeks earlier, he had reached a personal peak, named in the team of the tournament for Euro 2020, he had excelled for England. If Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s arrival altered the trajectory of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s reign at Old Trafford, so, too, for the Norwegian\u2019s chosen captain. The sense was that Ronaldo saw himself as a more fitting skipper. RecommendedHarry Maguire dropped as Manchester United captain by Erik ten HagThe stumbling block in Manchester United\u2019s pursuit of Sofyan AmrabatDavid de Gea, Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s last player, ends 88 years of Manchester United historyMaguire\u2019s form fell off a cliff; he came to look more clumsy and cumbersome, haunted and hapless. He was sent off in Solskjaer\u2019s final game, the thrashing at Watford; a few weeks earlier, he was terrible on his return to Leicester. He was not aided by the manager rushing him back when semi-fit; just as he had done when fast-tracking Maguire to the captaincy after only a few months at Old Trafford, Solskjaer seemed to overestimate him.Harry Maguire\u2019s fall from grace has been sharp under Erik ten Hag  (Getty Images)It may have made Keane\u2019s criticism more vitriolic; certainly Maguire was not flattered by comparisons with predecessors. The status of the United captaincy and the size of the club and his \u00a380m price tag configured a pressure that, ultimately, felt too much. There was, though, something sad about the way he became a figure of fun.The United captaincy has felt something of a hospital pass in recent years. Maguire at least prospered for much of his first 18 months with the armband, if not the last two years. Before him, United\u2019s official skipper tended to be injured, ageing or otherwise sidelined: Michael Carrick made just five appearances in 2017-18, Antonio Valencia just nine the following season and Ashley Young lost his place after inheriting the mantle from the Ecuadorian. Go back to 2016-17 and Wayne Rooney spent much of the second half of the campaign outside Jose Mourinho\u2019s preferred side. Maguire\u2019s powers waned, too, but at a younger age.If United have spent large swathes of the last 16 seasons being led by vice-captains and senior professionals, now Maguire has had two terrible seasons: one in the team, one outside it. Now, too, a team who have looked rudderless at times, especially in the torrid 2021-22, seem to have several leaders: Bruno Fernandes, the de facto skipper for much of last season, Varane, who wore the armband against Leeds last week, the charismatic Martinez, the hugely experienced Casemiro.The probability is that Fernandes will become Maguire\u2019s full-time successor: an automatic choice who appears immune to injury and takes responsibility, he has a compelling case, despite his occasional petulance. It is apparent Ten Hag felt the situation with Maguire was unsustainable. He acted decisively. And in the process, he has pushed Solskjaer\u2019s United further into the past."}, {"_id": "64b4f28a51ac331ac5b728c3", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon-prize-money-2023-b2375852.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wimbledon prize money: How much will the winners get?", "lead": "<p>The total prize money pool increased for this year\u2019s Championships </p>", "author": "Jamie Braidwood", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 07:13:55", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:30.795625", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T07:13:55+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/06/4fcedcbb328a23ebe70f39c8f2f15c29Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjIwMzk0-2.73024219.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

On Saturday, the unseeded 24-year-old Czech, Marketa Vondrousova, swept past crowd favourite Ons Jabeur to lift the Venus Rosewater Plate on Centre Court. She won in straight sets and couldn\u2019t believe how she\u2019d managed to pull off the feat almost a year after wrist surgery. Yesterday was the men\u2019s singles final. Carlos Alcaraz went up against Novak Djokovic and fought through a five-set thriller. Djokovic, aiming to win his fifth title in a row and eighth overall, took the first set in rapid fashion but Alcaraz dug deep and nicked the second in a tiebreak. By the end of the fourth the match was level yet an early break of Djokovic\u2019s serve in the deciding set gave Alcaraz the advantage and he made sure to keep. The 20-year-old sealed his victory and inflicted a first Centre Court defeat on Novak Djokovic in a decade. Magnificent stuff.

His whole life, it\u2019s about tennis.\u201cI think for them, watching his kid making history, lifting the trophy, winning Wimbledon, is something incredible for them. For me to have them there, giving them a big hug, it\u2019s something that I will never forget. I hope to have a photo from that moment because I\u2019m going to keep forever.\u201d (Getty Images)Jamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:541689539627Carlos Alcaraz: \u201cIf I would have lost that set, probably I couldn\u2019t lift the trophy. I probably could have lost in three sets, straight sets.\u201cI would say that gave me a lot of confidence, a lot of motivation to still going and to think that I\u2019m able to win Novak in that stage.\u201cI am totally different player than French Open. I grew up a lot since that moment. I learned a lot from that moment.\u201cI took lesson from that match. I did something different before the match. I prepared a little bit different mentally before the match. I could deal with the pressure, the nerves, better than I did in French Open.\u201cI think was the mental part that allow me to stay there during the five sets.\u201dJamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:331689538534Carlos Alcaraz is here, and is very much still in shock after winning the Wimbledon final: \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true for me, being a Wimbledon champion, something that I really wanted.

Yeah, it\u2019s time to enjoy and share everything, all my feelings.\u201cBeating Novak at his best, in this stage, making history, being the guy to beat him after 10 years unbeaten on that court, is amazing for me.\u201cIt\u2019s something that I will never forget, that\u2019s for sure. As I said, it\u2019s great for the new generation, as well, I think to see me beating him and making them think that they are capable to do it, as well.\u201cIt\u2019s great for me and I think for the young players, as well.\u201d (The Independent)Jamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:151689537002Novak Djokovic \u2018surprised\u2019 by Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s level at WimbledonA very gracious Novak Djokovic continues to praise Carlos Alcaraz, the new Wimbledon champion: \u201cI must say he surprised me. He surprised everyone how quickly he adapted to grass this year. He hasn\u2019t had too many wins on grass in the last two years that he played. Obviously him coming from clay, having the kind of style that he has.\u201cI think Queen\u2019s helped him a lot. He was close to lose that first match, opening match, in Queen\u2019s. Then he started to gain momentum, more and more wins against really good players.\u201cI must say the slices, the kind of chipping returns, the net play, it\u2019s very impressive. I didn\u2019t expect him to play so well this year on grass, but he\u2019s proven that he\u2019s the best player in the world, no doubt.\u201cHe\u2019s playing some fantastic tennis on different surfaces and he deserves to be where he is.\u201dJamie Braidwood16 July 2023 20:501689536516Novak Djokovic on Carlos Alcaraz: \u2018I haven\u2019t played someone like him, not ever Roger or Rafa\u2019 Novak Djokovic on Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s greatest strengths: \u201cI think people have been talking in the past 12 months or so about his game consisting of certain elements from Roger, Rafa, and myself. I would agree with that. I think he\u2019s got basically best of all three worlds.\u201cHe\u2019s got this mental resilience and really maturity for someone who is 20 years old. It\u2019s quite impressive. He\u2019s got this Spanish bull mentality of competitiveness and fighting spirit and incredible defense that we\u2019ve seen with Rafa over the years.\u201cAnd I think he\u2019s got some nice sliding backhands that he\u2019s got some similarities with my backhands. Yeah, two-handed backhands, defense, being able to adapt. I think that has been my personal strength for many years. He has it, too.\u201cI haven\u2019t played a player like him ever, to be honest. Roger and Rafa have their own obviously strengths and weaknesses. Carlos is very complete player. Amazing adapting capabilities that I think are a key for longevity and for successful career on all surfaces.\u201d (PA Wire)Jamie Braidwood16 July 2023 20:41\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a06Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64b4f28b51ac331ac5b728c6", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/declan-rice-arsenal-jack-grealish-b2376165.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Declan Rice move echoes Jack Grealish \u2013 and is Arsenal\u2019s statement signing", "lead": "<p>The England teammates are now on similar paths as they pursue the next phase of their football development  </p>", "author": "Richard Jolly", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:51:19", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:31.549264", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T06:51:19+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/07/SEI160921169.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA dozen years ago, Arsenal sought reinforcements at the heart of the midfield. The callow pair of 20-year-olds, Francis Coquelin and Aaron Ramsey, had started the historic humiliation of an 8-2 thrashing at Old Trafford. Arsene Wenger promptly signed a leader for who the prospect of playing for Arsenal had a greater allure than a lucrative contract to stay in David Moyes\u2019 team.The similarities between Mikel Arteta and Declan Rice may end there; the former West Ham captain marked his arrival at Arsenal by speaking of a determination to spend \u201cmy best years at this great club\u201d whereas, for the old Evertonian, it amounted to his last years as a player and, arguably, Goodison Park saw his him at his peak. At \u00a3105m, Rice cost rather more than his new manager. He arrives with Arsenal not at a low ebb but at a relative high, following their highest finish for seven years and with their best points total since the Invincibles.Manchester has a different pertinence now. By preferring Arsenal to Manchester City, he may have done the Premier League a wider service; Arteta needed Rice more and pursued him for longer but had Pep Guardiola secured the services of his former assistant\u2019s top target, it would have been still harder to envisage anyone overhauling the champions. There is a cold logic to Rice\u2019s decision, too, and not merely in the way his England sidekick Kalvin Phillips has floundered at City: tempting as it must have been to be presented as Ilkay Gundogan\u2019s replacement, Rodri\u2019s presence means Rice would only have been second choice for his optimum role. Instead, a team is being rebuilt around him. At Arsenal, he will have a significance commensurate with his record price tag; a new trio of Martin Odegaard, Kai Havertz and Rice has a bold look. There are dual reasons why Arteta\u2019s choice of a midfielder has particular intrigue. One is his background in the position, and the other his managerial apprenticeship at Guardiola\u2019s shoulder. It is notable that one of his midfield recruits so far \u2013 the January arrival Jorginho \u2013 was a target when they were together at City and that Oleksandr Zinchenko, converted into an inverted left-back by them at the Etihad, has adopted the same duties in the capital.

It also makes him the antithesis of Arteta the player. Arteta the manager, however, has shown a fondness for defensive midfielders, whether the incumbent Thomas Partey, the new recruit Rice or Moises Caicedo, a wanted man in January, with the physical power he lacked.Declan Rice\u2019s driving runs should suit Arsenal\u2019s midfield perfectly  (PA Wire)Rice\u2019s move has echoes of Jack Grealish\u2019s transfer to City for another nine-figure sum and not merely because each has traded the captaincy at one of the Premier League\u2019s middle class for a place in the ranks among the aristocracy. Despite the huge outlay, the former Aston Villa man was given different duties by Guardiola; for Rice, too, the job description may change.He has spent much of his time at West Ham in a pair with Tomas Soucek, often with the quite old-fashioned division of labour where one can go forward if the other remains back. Arsenal\u2019s midfield has a lone pivot and, with Havertz coming in and Granit Xhaka leaving, seems to have acquired a more attacking aspect. Rice will have to shoulder a huge responsibility. Unless he is teamed up in tougher games with Partey or Jorginho, the closest thing he may have to a partner could be Zinchenko in his hybrid role of full-back and wing-half. There will also be a stylistic shift: West Ham tended to have under half of possession, even when finishing in the top seven. Arsenal have rather more and Rice can expect greater involvement on the ball.But a theme of Rice\u2019s career has been the way he has risen to challenges and surpassed expectations, and not merely those of Chelsea when they infamously released him. On day one at Arsenal, he spoke of having \u201cmore levels to go up to\u201d. Improvement has been a constant in recent years and Rice can cast a gaze at new teammates and see a host who have progressed significantly under Arteta.RecommendedHow Declan Rice\u2019s move to Arsenal compares with other big-money transfersDeclan Rice confirms \u2018tough\u2019 West Ham departure with Arsenal move imminentDeclan Rice leaves West Ham for record fee with Arsenal move imminentHe belongs in the same bracket as others for different reasons. Arteta came to the Emirates Stadium in the austerity era under Arsene Wenger where most of the prices were small, buys were generally designed to produce profits and the occasional loss-making deal felt a greater problem. Under Arteta, there has been more of a willingness to stretch themselves and there are several, such as Ben White and Aaron Ramsdale, for whom Arsenal were initially accused of paying over the odds; there is, though, a logic to paying over the odds for the right player, if not the wrong one, and sometimes fees can soon seem more justifiable.He will be part of an English core, too, even if it is possible that only Ramsdale, Bukayo Saka and him start in the strongest side. Arteta has a youthful local contingent, just as Wenger did with Theo Walcott, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Carl Jenkinson and Kieran Gibbs when the Spaniard signed. Yet in another respect, there is only one parallel with Rice in the Frenchman\u2019s long reign. Not since Sol Campbell has an automatic choice for England joined Arsenal. Rice\u2019s move across London is more costly and less controversial but if there is pressure on Arsenal\u2019s record buy, there is less rancour around him. But, like Campbell 22 years ago, he is a statement signing nonetheless."}, {"_id": "64b4f28b51ac331ac5b728c7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/carlos-alcaraz-novak-djokovic-wimbledon-final-b2376245.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Carlos Alcaraz captures the impossible and now Wimbledon will never be the same again", "lead": "<p>Carlos Alcaraz not only became the champion of SW19 when he defeated Novak Djokovic, but the people\u2019s champion as well  </p>", "author": "Jamie Braidwood", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 18:13:35", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:31.798993", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T18:13:35+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/16/19/GettyImages-1548777036.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

And how he deserves it, not only to beat Djokovic in the manner he did, but to close it by staying true to what he wants to bring every time he steps out onto a tennis court. Serving it out, Alcaraz put his signature drop shot into the net on the opening point, only to go for the drop shot again, and then spin the lob over Djokovic\u2019s head. From there, the serve, and a remarkable transition onto grass was complete.Carlos Alcaraz, the new king of Centre Court  (Getty Images)Novak Djokovic was denied a record Wimbledon title  (Getty Images)This, after all, should not be happening, on what is Alcaraz\u2019s fourth tournament on grass. He arrived in London four weeks ago looking to learn and, at first, having to survive on the surface. Just reaching the final was a dream, but what followed will become legend.Like the best finals, there were several contests at once here; matches within sets, sets within games. The meeting of the two best players in the world, separated by age but brought together by their standing at the top of the sport, started with a match that no one expected: a thrashing. Djokovic showed the experience of a 23-time grand slam champion as Alcaraz suffered with nerves. Alcaraz was erratic but, as it so often is, the answer for that was on the other side of the net.Djokovic dominated the opening set to lead Alcaraz  (Getty Images)Djokovic, as solid as a rock, began to toy with his younger opponent, using Alcaraz\u2019s drop shot against him. How that would turn in the latter stages, but as the intensity of the rallies sharpened by the third game, Djokovic remained in complete control. If the defending champion hadn\u2019t been required to get out of third gear throughout these Championships, this was a statement. Djokovic was too quick, too alert even for Alcaraz, and he dominated the rallies.Alcaraz, though, found his confidence and started to display his magnificent shot-making. It came as Djokovic lost track of his serve, with his ball toss causing him particular difficulty in the breeze, reducing his already slow service routine and its endless ball bouncing to a snail\u2019s pace. Yet as Djokovic tightened his game from the baseline and stared down the other end of the court for a reaction, Alcaraz met it dead in the eye, beginning to hit bravely for the lines. It became a different match entirely.But to become an epic one, it needed a twist. In the tiebreak, Djokovic slumped two backhands into the net in a row to give Alcaraz set point. Finally, Djokovic\u2019s vulnerable serve \u2013 which stood at 50 per cent in the second set \u2013 crumbled. Alcaraz attacked it, flashing the backhand winner down the line. Somehow, Alcaraz had overturned the momentum, but he knew there was a long way to go. As the backhand landed, Alcaraz could have roared after it, darting and shouting. Instead he stood, soaked it in, pointed to his head. In control, it was game on.Alcaraz responded after Djokovic won the opening set  (Getty Images)And like all legendary duels on this hallowed court, the details soon faded among the dizzying rallies, the stupefying shots, amid games that lasted an eternity. Somewhere in the fog, a great champion creaked and Djokovic\u2019s third backhand error in quick succession handed Alcaraz the break at the start of the third. Now facing against the tide, Djokovic tried to claw on with all he had, but Alcaraz was unrelenting, outlasting Djokovic in a 32-point game that was almost as long as the opening set.When it was won, Alcaraz roared again,\u00a0and Centre Court believed too. Djokovic saw the set slip away, an unthinkable 6-1 landslide that hinged on a brutal tug of war and threatened to define the final. But Djokovic found a fight from deep within, as well as his serve and unerring return to deconstruct Alcaraz. He forced the fifth, of course he wasn\u2019t done.But then Alcaraz went again. Usually, it is Djokovic who rises in the decider, but Alcaraz found his steel and used it against the Serbian. Alcaraz saved break point with a stunning forehand down the line, then denying Djokovic after he had picked himself up from the grass to try and keep the match alive. Alcaraz, toying with his opponent now, slapping the most extraordinary forehand winner, took the break. Djokovic smashed his racket into the net post, the dream of equalling Federer\u2019s men\u2019s record unravelling, another calendar grand slam up in smoke.Recommended32 points, 26 minutes: Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic\u2019s epic game in numbersNovak Djokovic breaks down in tears as Carlos Alcaraz denies Wimbledon dreamThe sporting weekend in picturesAlacaraz holding a winner\u2019s trophy is likely to become a regular sight  (Getty)This was Alcaraz\u2019s dream and after his stunning rise through the sport, a grand slam champion at 19, the youngest world No 1 of all time, this was a moment to stand above the rest. Alcaraz had pictured it. Just playing the Wimbledon final, he said on Friday, would be the best day of his life. Beating a champion like Djokovic, he said, would be extra special. And then the moment came and it was purer than anything he could have imagined."}, {"_id": "64b4f28c51ac331ac5b728c8", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/kalvin-phillips-fabinho-liverpool-scott-mctominay-manchester-united-b2376429.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Football rumours: Kalvin Phillips attracting interest from Liverpool", "lead": "Meanwhile, Scott McTominay could be up for sale at Manchester United.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:22:12", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:32.028246", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T06:22:12+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/07/26245f7b4b1eca3242421fc1ccf0409aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjQ0Mzgz-2.71859900.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

She ended the 2023 edition as the first unseeded women\u2019s champion in the event\u2019s history.The Olympic silver medallist beat four seeds to reach the semi-finals, where she ended the emotional run of Ukrainian wild card Elina Svitolina.She was the underdog once more in the final against last year\u2019s runner-up Ons Jabeur, but overcame early nerves to win in straight sets and lift the Venus Rosewater Dish.The future is nowDjokovic had not lost at Wimbledon since 2017 and had not been defeated on Centre Court since Andy Murray beat him in the 2013 final. Enter Alcaraz.The Spanish world number one overcame a wobbly first set to beat the seven-time champion in five epic sets.The calendar Grand Slam continues to elude Djokovic, but he will still be heavily backed to win another major title in his career and match Margaret Court\u2019s record of 24.But Alcaraz\u2019s progress on grass means the odds of equalling Roger Federer\u2019s eight titles in SW19 will have lengthened.Tweet of the tournamentPicture of the tournamentBrit watchBritish interest in the adult singles competitions ended in the first week, with Liam Broady and Katie Boulter both losing in the third round.Andy Murray\u2019s hopes of a long run were ended by fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the second round, while Cameron Norrie \u2013 who reached the semi-finals a year ago \u2013 also exited at the same stage to exciting American Chris Eubanks.But it was not all doom and gloom for the host nation.Wolverhampton\u2019s Henry Searle won the boys\u2019 singles final \u2013 the first British boy to do so since Stanley Matthews in 1961 \u2013 Liverpudlian Neal Skupski was victorious in the men\u2019s doubles title with his Dutch partner Wesley Koolhof and Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid lifted the men\u2019s wheelchair doubles title.Russia and Belarus returnAfter being banned from the 2022 edition due to the war in Ukraine, players from Russia and Belarus returned this summer.Generally, they were well received by the crowds but organisers would likely have breathed a sigh of relief when Aryna Sabalenka and Daniil Medvedev both fell at the semi-final stage, avoiding the possibility of the Princess of Wales presenting the trophy to a Belarusian or Russian player.The only controversy came when Victoria Azarenka of Belarus was booed off court following her fourth-round defeat by Ukrainian Svitolina.Azarenka, who put up her hand to acknowledge Svitolina knowing her opponent did not wish to shake hands with a player from the aggressor countries, branded fans \u201cdrunk\u201d and unfair.Quote of the tournament\n\nI'm still 17, I want to open champagne...

was made in the women\u2019s final as unseeded Marketa Vondrousova won.Here, the PA news agency picks out five things we learned at the championships.Djokovic proves mortal as Alcaraz reignsRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThere was a men\u2019s final for the ages as long-time ruler Novak Djokovic, who had gone 10 years unbeaten on Centre Court, came up against the heir to the throne in the shape of Carlos Alcaraz.Well, the Spaniard proved that he is ready to take the crown now as he won a near-five-hour final in five sets to claim a first Wimbledon title and deny his opponent a record-equalling eighth.This is the start of a rivalry that will last as long as Djokovic carries on playing and it is fascinating to see how the 36-year-old reacts to his first SW19 defeat since 2017.Wimbledon welcomes back Russian and Belarusian playersRussian and Belarusian players returned to Wimbledon following last year\u2019s ban due to the invasion of Ukraine and were generally well received.Men\u2019s world number three Daniil Medvedev and women\u2019s world number two Aryna Sabalenka made up for lost time by each reaching the semi-finals.While political tensions remained relatively muted, there was a flash point when Victoria Azarenka of Belarus was jeered off court following her fourth-round defeat by Ukrainian Elina Svitolina.Azarenka, who put up her hand to acknowledge Svitolina knowing her opponent did not wish to shake hands with a player from the aggressor countries, branded fans \u201cdrunk\u201d and unfair.Curfew causes issuesThe All England Club\u2019s insistence on beginning Centre Court matches at 1.30pm remains a source of frustration for some.Djokovic led calls to overhaul the scheduling after his match with Hubert Hurkacz had to be suspended overnight due to the council-imposed 11pm curfew, while Andy Murray\u2019s clash with Stefanos Tsitsipas was also impacted.Despite objections, Wimbledon chief executive Sally Bolton offered no guarantees that earlier starts will be considered for next year\u2019s tournament.Beginning matches later makes the final contest of the day a prime-time occasion on BBC television and it appears that is now the goal, with Bolton reporting record viewing figures.Britons fail to shine on big stageQuestion marks hang over the state of British tennis after home interest in the adult singles draws was wiped out before the end of week one.Women\u2019s number one Katie Boulter was the last Briton standing but her hopes were emphatically ended by a thumping third-round defeat to defending champion Elena Rybakina on day six.Two-time winner Murray, men\u2019s number one Cameron Norrie and Liam Broady had all crashed out the previous day, while the raft of wild cards failed to produce a surprise package.On a more positive note, 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu and potential star Jack Draper should soon return after missing the Championships through injury while 17-year-old Henry Searle became the first British boys\u2019 singles champion at Wimbledon since 1962 and 14-year-old Mark Ceban won the boys\u2019 under-14 event.\u2018Big three\u2019 dominance brokenFor the first time since Ashleigh Barty won the 2022 Australian Open and subsequently retired, there was a grand slam champion from outside the so-called \u2018big three\u2019 of the women\u2019s game.Three-time major winner Iga Swiatek has been the dominant force post-Barty, while Sabalenka and Rybakina have each won one of the leading tournaments in that time.RecommendedFrom Chris Eubanks to Mirra Andreeva \u2013 Wimbledon\u2019s headline makers in 2023Novak Djokovic defeat the biggest surprise in a Wimbledon

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBritain\u2019s leading players were sunning themselves on holiday as the Wimbledon finals took centre stage.The tournament was not even at the half-way stage when Katie Boulter\u2019s late-night demolition by Elena Rybakina ended home singles hopes in the third round.There had been some good moments, notably a first victory on Centre Court for Liam Broady against fourth seed Casper Ruud to join Boulter in the third round.Boulter is now well inside the top 100 after building on her first WTA Tour title in Nottingham, with the player she beat in the final, Jodie Burrage, also set to hit two figures for the first time.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveBut there is no sugarcoating the fact that the only female British players in singles at Wimbledon needed wild cards and there were none at all at the French Open.For a country that hosts a grand slam and receives more than \u00a340million in no-strings-attached funding from the All England Club a year, that is clearly not good enough.The incredible success of Andy Murray, followed by standout moments for Emma Raducanu, Kyle Edmund and Cameron Norrie, has masked what remain stubborn weaknesses, and now the mask has fallen, what lies behind is not a particularly pretty sight.It is certainly not all doom and gloom \u2013 there remain four British men in the top 100, a number that would have been cause for champagne corks popping for much of the last 40 years, with Norrie and Dan Evans consistent top-30 players.Boulter and Burrage have a great chance to establish themselves in the top 100 and become grand slam regulars, while Harriet Dart, Katie Swan, Heather Watson and Broady are also within striking distance.But true strength in depth remains an elusive goal, and even that does not guarantee second-week interest at grand slams.It was interesting to hear French tennis officials having to answer the same questions as their Lawn Tennis Association counterparts over a slew of early exits at Roland Garros despite France boasting 12 players in the men\u2019s top 100.Of the grand slam nations, only the US, with its advantages in population, facilities and weather, has a good balance of numbers and high-ranked players, and even they are wondering where their next slam champion is coming from.Eastern European nations with a fraction of the budget have been far more successful in creating winners, and that is a conundrum the wealthier federations continue to try to crack.The LTA has puts its eggs in the basket of a national academy in Loughborough that heavily funds and supports a small group of teenage players.The jury remains out on whether it is the best use of the governing body\u2019s millions but there is at least evidence it is working for the players who are there.Girls\u2019 singles quarter-finalists Ranah Stoiber and Mika Stojsavljevic are both among the chosen few, as is 17-year-old Henry Searle, who brilliantly ended a 61-year wait for a boys\u2019 singles champion at Wimbledon in maybe the best moment of the tournament for the home nation.Translating junior success into a strong professional career is never a given but Searle is clearly a big talent and there is a group of promising girls including Stoiber, Stojsavljevic, Isabelle Lacy, Mingge Xu and 14-year-old Hannah Klugman, around whom there is a great deal of excitement.Mark Ceban, meanwhile, cemented his status as the best 14-year-old boy in Europe by winning the under-14 title.RecommendedFrom Chris Eubanks to Mirra Andreeva \u2013 Wimbledon\u2019s headline makers in 2023Novak Djokovic defeat the biggest surprise in a Wimbledon full of talking pointsAlcaraz the new king as big three stutter \u2013 what we learned at WimbledonPatience will be needed with all of them, and the most encouraging sign in the short term would be if Raducanu and Jack Draper, who are still very early in their careers, can return to full fitness and avoid the consistent injury problems that have frustratingly held them back.Credit should also be given to Neal Skupski, who ticked the one box missing from his CV with his first grand slam men\u2019s doubles title, and Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid for their ongoing success in the wheelchair game."}, {"_id": "64b4f28d51ac331ac5b728ce", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/novak-djokovic-carlos-alcaraz-elina-svitolina-centre-court-roger-federer-b2376403.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Novak Djokovic defeat the biggest surprise in a Wimbledon full of talking points", "lead": "Djokovic\u2019s long reign as men\u2019s champion came to an end in a stunning five-set final.", "author": "Andy Sims", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 05:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:33.467763", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T05:00:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/06/4fcedcbb328a23ebe70f39c8f2f15c29Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjIwMzk0-2.73024219.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe Russians returned, a Ukrainian charmed Centre Court, an American punched above his weight, there were protests, curfews, boos and even a spying controversy. But most unusually of all, Novak Djokovic did not win.He came close, though. Wimbledon 2023 looked set to go the same way as the previous four in the men\u2019s draw, Djokovic bidding to take his number of titles to eight \u2013 level with Roger Federer \u2013 and his total of grand slam wins to 24 to equal Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record.But along came Carlos Alcaraz, the swashbuckling 20-year-old bundle of Spanish energy, a smiling assassin, and suddenly the irresistible force had beaten the immovable object.Djokovic was supposed to stroll to the title, a testament to his enduring greatness, but also a damning indictment of the rest of the field if a 36-year-old can knock them all over with ease.But Alcaraz struck a blow for the young pretenders with a five-set victory over four-and-three-quarter dramatic hours, in what was only his 18th match on grass.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveAlcaraz had earlier in the week shrugged off \u2018spygate\u2019 claims that his father had been seen filming Djokovic practising with all his wide-eyed, boyish charm, simply saying: \u201cOh, probably it is true. My father is a huge fan of tennis.\u201dThe breakout star of the Championships was American Chris Eubanks, who landed some heavyweight shots on his run to the quarter-finals, knocking out British number one Cameron Norrie and fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas along the way.Wild card Liam Broady flew the British flag the furthest in the men\u2019s draw, accounting for fourth seed \u2013 and renowned grass-phobe \u2013 Casper Ruud before falling to Dennis Shapovalov in round three.The women\u2019s champion was not so easy to pick, as has been the case for the last few years, and although a \u2018big three\u2019 has started to emerge, both world number one Iga Swiatek and defending champion Elena Rybakina exited at the quarter-final stage, and second seed Aryna Sabalenka in the semis.Unseeded Ukrainian Elina Svitolina became the darling of Centre Court, reaching the semi-finals just nine months after her daughter Skai was born.Svitolina\u2019s stance in not shaking hands with players from Russia or Belarus,\u00a0who were banned last year due to the conflict in her homeland, led to fourth-round opponent Victoria Azarenka being\u00a0booed off Centre Court, with spectators assuming it was her who had snubbed the handshake.The Wimbledon crowd evidently know more about Pimm\u2019s and strawberries than they do about the world political landscape.Sabalenka\u2019s loss to Ons Jabeur \u2013 and Daniil Medvedev\u2019s defeat by Alcaraz in the men\u2019s semi \u2013 did at least spare the All England Club from the awkward optic of the Princess of Wales handing over the trophy to a Belarusian or Russian player.Svitolina beat Swiatek in the last eight but her run was ended by Czech Marketa Vondrousova, the world number 42, who went on to become the first unseeded woman to win the title after a straight-sets demolition of Jabeur.British number one Katie Boulter, unfazed by Just Stop Oil\u2019s bizarre orange confetti/jigsaw puzzle interruption \u2013 the second such protest on day three \u2013 made the third round but was brutally taken down by Rybakina, 6-1 6-1.The rain, frustratingly a feature throughout the fortnight, meant only an hour\u2019s play was possible on the outside courts on day two, causing a backlog of matches and a headache for the schedulers.That did not affect the show courts, but Wimbledon\u2019s stubborn insistence that play should not start before 1.30pm on Centre meant too many late finishes and, on two occasions, matches being unable to finish due to the strict 11pm curfew.Djokovic disposed of Stan Wawrinka with 14 minutes to spare, but not even he could beat Hubert Hurkacz inside their allotted two hours after two lengthy matches beforehand, and the Serbian had to come back in on his day off to finish the job.RecommendedFrom Chris Eubanks to Mirra Andreeva \u2013 Wimbledon\u2019s headline makers in 2023Wimbledon shows lack of depth in British game \u2013 but it\u2019s not all doom and gloomAlcaraz the new king as big three stutter \u2013 what we learned at WimbledonThe same happened to Andy Murray, the latest leg of his extended farewell tour ending in the second round when he was outlasted over five sets and two days by Tsitsipas.Djokovic suggested play should start at 12pm, but that is another contest at Wimbledon that he probably will not win."}, {"_id": "64b4f28d51ac331ac5b728cf", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon-andy-murray-elina-svitolina-holger-rune-carlos-alcaraz-b2376400.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Wimbledon\u2019s best matches: Another Murray classic to a final for the ages", "lead": "The best singles matches from a memorable fortnight in SW19.", "author": "Jonathan Veal", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 05:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:33.688177", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T05:00:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/06/3a2af542188d5e58f7639e759bb5e90fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjE4NjQz-2.72900758.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWimbledon is over for another year but it once again lived up to expectations with plenty of memorable moments.Here, the PA news agency takes a look at five of the best singles matches in SW19 this year.Andy Murray v Stefanos TsitsipasIt is a shame the clash between two-time champion Andy Murray and fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas came as early as the second round and the pair did not disappoint over two days of action.Starting around 7.30pm on the first Thursday, the first two tie-break sets were shared with Tsitsipas winning the first and Murray levelling up.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMurray immediately broke early in the third set which he then won, and was looking very good, but at 10.40pm the match was suspended due to the impending curfew.They came back the following day and Murray could not regain his level, though would have had break points in the fourth set \u2013 that could have allowed him to then serve for the match \u2013 had he challenged an incorrect line call.However, Tsitsipas was too good in the decider and sealed a 7-6 (3) 6-7 (2) 6-4 6-7 (3) 6-4 victory.Holger Rune v Alejandro Davidovich FokinaThis third-round match may have gone on for a minute shy of four hours but it will always be remembered for the penultimate point.After trading two sets apiece, with the Spaniard Davidovich Fokina going two sets to one up before Rune levelled, the fifth set went to a tiebreak.That was typically tight and the first-to-10 breaker was tied at 8-8 with Fokina serving.What happened next left everyone in shock as the 31st seed incredibly decided to produce an underarm serve, which Rune dispatched with ease to set up match point.He then converted at the first attempt to seal a 6-3 4-6 3-6 6-4 7-6 (8) victory.Elina Svitolina v Victoria AzarenkaA Sunday night clash on Court One produced great sporting theatre, full of drama and controversy.Underpinning the fourth-round match between two mothers was some incredible tennis, but it was the first time a Ukrainian player had come up against a Russian or Belarussian at this year\u2019s tournament.Elina Svitolina, who went on to lose in the semi-finals, felt that she was playing for a higher cause than herself throughout the whole tournament and after battling from a set down produced a brilliant victory in a dramatic and tense deciding tie-break to win 2-6 6-4 7-6 (9).But it was not until after the match that the real drama happened as Svitolina, as has been customary since the war in Ukraine began, refused to shake hands with Belarussian Azarenka, who was roundly booed by the Court One crowd when she then left the stadium promptly.Ons Jabeur v Aryna SabalenkaWhen Aryna Sabalenka was serving at 40-30, a point away from going 5-3 up in the second set of her semi-final against Ons Jabeur having already won the first, she cannot be blamed if she allowed herself to think of the final.The second seed had put on a resolute display against last year\u2019s beaten finalist, hitting her way out of trouble against the tricky Tunisian to put herself on the brink of victory.But then Jabeur preyed on a moment of weakness from Sabalenka and won three successive games to send the match to a decider.With momentum on her side she was able to control the third set to eventually post a 6-7 (5) 6-4 6-3 victory.Carlos Alcaraz v Novak DjokovicWimbledon saved the best for last as Carlos Alcaraz claimed a first SW19 title in an epic final against defending champion Novak Djokovic.The Serbian had been unbeaten on Centre Court since Andy Murray beat him in 2013 so it was going to take something special from the Spaniard to end that 45-match run \u2013 and he delivered.An inauspicious start saw him fall a set down quickly and then Djokovic had a set point to go 2-0 up and surely on the way to a record-equalling eighth title.RecommendedFrom Chris Eubanks to Mirra Andreeva \u2013 Wimbledon\u2019s headline makers in 2023Novak Djokovic defeat the biggest surprise in a Wimbledon full of talking pointsWimbledon shows lack of depth in British game \u2013 but it\u2019s not all doom and gloomBut a missed backhand proved pivotal as Alcaraz mounted an astonishing comeback to go 2-1 up before Djokovic took it to a decider by winning the fourth set.However, the 20-year-old world number one battled back brilliantly to win 1-6 7-6 (8) 6-1 3-6 6-4."}, {"_id": "64b4f28d51ac331ac5b728d0", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/mirra-andreeva-roger-federer-wimbledon-american-andy-murray-b2376404.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "From Chris Eubanks to Mirra Andreeva \u2013 Wimbledon\u2019s headline makers in 2023", "lead": "American Eubanks became a crowd favourite in SW19 while 16-year-old Russian Andreeva showed her immense talent and her fiery temper.", "author": "Jonathan Veal", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 05:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:33.932694", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T05:00:00+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/06/a62318a76b0620cb1a4195e97a5c1fb4Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NTk4ODU0-2.72914462.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWimbledon has a new champion, and a new hero. To break new ground and end Novak Djokovic\u2019s dominance at the All England Club, Carlos Alcaraz had to go to a place no one else had dared to reach, dragging the most successful men\u2019s player of all time into a battle that saw this final live up to its hype and will be remembered as one of the greatest ever staged here.In overturning history, Alcaraz played with a spirit of infectious belief and carried Centre Court with him. The 20-year-old Spaniard met Djokovic head on, denying the Serbian a fifth consecutive Wimbledon title, refusing to go down against the game\u2019s most formidable force and a legend of the sport who had won 104 matches in a row from a set up at the grand slams.A titanic, 26-minute game midway through the third set captured Alcaraz\u2019s stunning resilience and tenacity to believe in the miracle he was trying to accomplish. Already up a break, Alcaraz hunted for another, not once letting Djokovic off the hook. The 36-year-old Djokovic, who had controlled his young opponent magnificently to race to the opening set, was suddenly stressed, rushed, and in danger.He knew what Alcaraz threatened to do. Djokovic had won 34 matches in a row at Wimbledon. He had not lost on Centre Court in 10 years, since losing to Andy Murray in the 2013 final. But he had also not faced an opponent like Alcaraz, a 20-year-old who lives every moment and approaches every shot like he has the chance to make the impossible possible. The second-set tiebreak was another turning point: Djokovic had won 15 tiebreaks in a row coming into the final, Alcaraz, who faced the brink then, barely blinked.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Carlos Alcaraz defeats Novak Djokovic in five-set epic to win men\u2019s finalOne game, 26 minutes, 32 points: Numbers behind Alcaraz and Djokovic\u2019s Wimbledon final epicNovak Djokovic told to \u2018get on with it\u2019 as Wimbledon fans left frustratedTiebreaks are Djokovic\u2019s realm, his palace where he shows his mental fortitude, and a place Alcaraz\u2019s peers dare to tread. Alcaraz ended Djokovic\u2019s reign with his powerful forehand, his dazzling speed and his wondrous creativity. Even as Djokovic forced a fifth, Alcaraz never once lost sight of what he was fighting for. He roared back, and now Wimbledon will never be the same again.He is the new people\u2019s champion: after 21 years of Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray, there is a new name on the illustrious board of winners. And how he deserves it, not only to beat Djokovic in the manner he did, but to close it by staying true to what he wants to bring every time he steps out onto a tennis court. Serving it out, Alcaraz put his signature drop shot into the net on the opening point, only to go for the drop shot again, and then spin the lob over Djokovic\u2019s head. From there, the serve, and a remarkable transition onto grass was complete.Carlos Alcaraz, the new king of Centre Court  (Getty Images)Novak Djokovic was denied a record Wimbledon title  (Getty Images)This, after all, should not be happening, on what is Alcaraz\u2019s fourth tournament on grass. He arrived in London four weeks ago looking to learn and, at first, having to survive on the surface. Just reaching the final was a dream, but what followed will become legend.Like the best finals, there were several contests at once here; matches within sets, sets within games. The meeting of the two best players in the world, separated by age but brought together by their standing at the top of the sport, started with a match that no one expected: a thrashing. Djokovic showed the experience of a 23-time grand slam champion as Alcaraz suffered with nerves. Alcaraz was erratic but, as it so often is, the answer for that was on the other side of the net.Djokovic dominated the opening set to lead Alcaraz  (Getty Images)Djokovic, as solid as a rock, began to toy with his younger opponent, using Alcaraz\u2019s drop shot against him. How that would turn in the latter stages, but as the intensity of the rallies sharpened by the third game, Djokovic remained in complete control. If the defending champion hadn\u2019t been required to get out of third gear throughout these Championships, this was a statement. Djokovic was too quick, too alert even for Alcaraz, and he dominated the rallies.Alcaraz, though, found his confidence and started to display his magnificent shot-making. It came as Djokovic lost track of his serve, with his ball toss causing him particular difficulty in the breeze, reducing his already slow service routine and its endless ball bouncing to a snail\u2019s pace. Yet as Djokovic tightened his game from the baseline and stared down the other end of the court for a reaction, Alcaraz met it dead in the eye, beginning to hit bravely for the lines. It became a different match entirely.But to become an epic one, it needed a twist. In the tiebreak, Djokovic slumped two backhands into the net in a row to give Alcaraz set point. Finally, Djokovic\u2019s vulnerable serve \u2013 which stood at 50 per cent in the second set \u2013 crumbled. Alcaraz attacked it, flashing the backhand winner down the line. Somehow, Alcaraz had overturned the momentum, but he knew there was a long way to go. As the backhand landed, Alcaraz could have roared after it, darting and shouting. Instead he stood, soaked it in, pointed to his head. In control, it was game on.Alcaraz responded after Djokovic won the opening set  (Getty Images)And like all legendary duels on this hallowed court, the details soon faded among the dizzying rallies, the stupefying shots, amid games that lasted an eternity. Somewhere in the fog, a great champion creaked and Djokovic\u2019s third backhand error in quick succession handed Alcaraz the break at the start of the third. Now facing against the tide, Djokovic tried to claw on with all he had, but Alcaraz was unrelenting, outlasting Djokovic in a 32-point game that was almost as long as the opening set.When it was won, Alcaraz roared again,\u00a0and Centre Court believed too. Djokovic saw the set slip away, an unthinkable 6-1 landslide that hinged on a brutal tug of war and threatened to define the final. But Djokovic found a fight from deep within, as well as his serve and unerring return to deconstruct Alcaraz. He forced the fifth, of course he wasn\u2019t done.But then Alcaraz went again. Usually, it is Djokovic who rises in the decider, but Alcaraz found his steel and used it against the Serbian. Alcaraz saved break point with a stunning forehand down the line, then denying Djokovic after he had picked himself up from the grass to try and keep the match alive. Alcaraz, toying with his opponent now, slapping the most extraordinary forehand winner, took the break. Djokovic smashed his racket into the net post, the dream of equalling Federer\u2019s men\u2019s record unravelling, another calendar grand slam up in smoke.Recommended32 points, 26 minutes: Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic\u2019s epic game in numbersNovak Djokovic breaks down in tears as Carlos Alcaraz denies Wimbledon dreamThe sporting weekend in picturesAlacaraz holding a winner\u2019s trophy is likely to become a regular sight  (Getty)This was Alcaraz\u2019s dream and after his stunning rise through the sport, a grand slam champion at 19, the youngest world No 1 of all time, this was a moment to stand above the rest. Alcaraz had pictured it. Just playing the Wimbledon final, he said on Friday, would be the best day of his life. Beating a champion like Djokovic, he said, would be extra special. And then the moment came and it was purer than anything he could have imagined."}, {"_id": "64b4f28f51ac331ac5b728d7", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/brisbane-republic-of-ireland-colombia-sullivan-australia-b2376383.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Republic of Ireland ready to bounce back after dramatic World Cup warm-up clash", "lead": "The World Cup warm-up against Colombia in Brisbane was abandoned after 20 minutes.", "author": "Rachel Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 04:21:07", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:35.810417", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T04:21:07+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/05/a8ded7f495263354f68e728de540a6e9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjUyNzY2-2.72808195.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Djokovic had also won his previous 104 grand slam matches after winning the opening set.In doing so, the 20-year-old Spaniard brings one of the most dominant eras of tennis history to an end.

On Saturday, the unseeded 24-year-old Czech, Marketa Vondrousova, swept past crowd favourite Ons Jabeur to lift the Venus Rosewater Plate on Centre Court. She won in straight sets and couldn\u2019t believe how she\u2019d managed to pull off the feat almost a year after wrist surgery. Yesterday was the men\u2019s singles final. Carlos Alcaraz went up against Novak Djokovic and fought through a five-set thriller. Djokovic, aiming to win his fifth title in a row and eighth overall, took the first set in rapid fashion but Alcaraz dug deep and nicked the second in a tiebreak. By the end of the fourth the match was level yet an early break of Djokovic\u2019s serve in the deciding set gave Alcaraz the advantage and he made sure to keep. The 20-year-old sealed his victory and inflicted a first Centre Court defeat on Novak Djokovic in a decade. Magnificent stuff. Mike Jones17 July 2023 08:161689540887Carlos Alcaraz: \u201cIt\u2019s big moment not just for me, but for my family, for all the people around me. It\u2019s really, really special moment.\u201cI start playing tennis thanks my dad. Really huge fan of tennis. I mean, he was watching tennis before I was born. It\u2019s crazy. His whole life, it\u2019s about tennis.\u201cI think for them, watching his kid making history, lifting the trophy, winning Wimbledon, is something incredible for them. For me to have them there, giving them a big hug, it\u2019s something that I will never forget. I hope to have a photo from that moment because I\u2019m going to keep forever.\u201d (Getty Images)Jamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:541689539627Carlos Alcaraz: \u201cIf I would have lost that set, probably I couldn\u2019t lift the trophy. I probably could have lost in three sets, straight sets.\u201cI would say that gave me a lot of confidence, a lot of motivation to still going and to think that I\u2019m able to win Novak in that stage.\u201cI am totally different player than French Open. I grew up a lot since that moment. I learned a lot from that moment.\u201cI took lesson from that match. I did something different before the match. I prepared a little bit different mentally before the match. I could deal with the pressure, the nerves, better than I did in French Open.\u201cI think was the mental part that allow me to stay there during the five sets.\u201dJamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:331689538534Carlos Alcaraz is here, and is very much still in shock after winning the Wimbledon final: \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true for me, being a Wimbledon champion, something that I really wanted. Honestly, I didn\u2019t expect to get it really soon. Yeah, it\u2019s time to enjoy and share everything, all my feelings.\u201cBeating Novak at his best, in this stage, making history, being the guy to beat him after 10 years unbeaten on that court, is amazing for me.\u201cIt\u2019s something that I will never forget, that\u2019s for sure. As I said, it\u2019s great for the new generation, as well, I think to see me beating him and making them think that they are capable to do it, as well.\u201cIt\u2019s great for me and I think for the young players, as well.\u201d (The Independent)Jamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:151689537002Novak Djokovic \u2018surprised\u2019 by Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s level at WimbledonA very gracious Novak Djokovic continues to praise Carlos Alcaraz, the new Wimbledon champion: \u201cI must say he surprised me. He surprised everyone how quickly he adapted to grass this year. He hasn\u2019t had too many wins on grass in the last two years that he played. Obviously him coming from clay, having the kind of style that he has.\u201cI think Queen\u2019s helped him a lot. He was close to lose that first match, opening match, in Queen\u2019s. Then he started to gain momentum, more and more wins against really good players.\u201cI must say the slices, the kind of chipping returns, the net play, it\u2019s very impressive. I didn\u2019t expect him to play so well this year on grass, but he\u2019s proven that he\u2019s the best player in the world, no doubt.\u201cHe\u2019s playing some fantastic tennis on different surfaces and he deserves to be where he is.\u201dJamie Braidwood16 July 2023 20:501689536516Novak Djokovic on Carlos Alcaraz: \u2018I haven\u2019t played someone like him, not ever Roger or Rafa\u2019 Novak Djokovic on Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s greatest strengths: \u201cI think people have been talking in the past 12 months or so about his game consisting of certain elements from Roger, Rafa, and myself. I would agree with that. I think he\u2019s got basically best of all three worlds.\u201cHe\u2019s got this mental resilience and really maturity for someone who is 20 years old. It\u2019s quite impressive. He\u2019s got this Spanish bull mentality of competitiveness and fighting spirit and incredible defense that we\u2019ve seen with Rafa over the years.\u201cAnd I think he\u2019s got some nice sliding backhands that he\u2019s got some similarities with my backhands. Yeah, two-handed backhands, defense, being able to adapt. I think that has been my personal strength for many years. He has it, too.\u201cI haven\u2019t played a player like him ever, to be honest. Roger and Rafa have their own obviously strengths and weaknesses. Carlos is very complete player. Amazing adapting capabilities that I think are a key for longevity and for successful career on all surfaces.\u201d (PA Wire)Jamie Braidwood16 July 2023 20:41\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a06Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64b4f29051ac331ac5b728d9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/carlos-alcaraz-wimbledon-novak-djokovic-australia-marketa-vondrousova-b2376368.html", "primaryCategory": "Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The sporting weekend in pictures", "lead": "Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz denied Novak Djokovic in a thrilling final at Wimbledon as Australia\u2019s women retained the Ashes.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 04:00:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:36.379228", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T04:00:27+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/05/9946a3800fc537542591daa585f56eabY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjI1NTIy-2.73024474.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

No club who featured in the Championship last season made the top 10, with fourth-placed Plymouth promoted into the second tier at the end of last season.Brentford finished in 10th overall.Cambridge came top on governance in the Index, Lincoln led the way on equality standards and Exeter were first on fan engagement.Three of the six lowest-ranked clubs in the Index are Championship sides \u2013 Cardiff, Middlesbrough and League One play-off winners Sheffield Wednesday, while Premier League side Nottingham Forest had the lowest rating of all.Despite Forest being bottom, Premier League clubs had the highest average Index score \u2013 50.0 \u2013 driven primarily by revenue being such a big factor in the financial sustainability, but were the worst performing on average for fan engagement.Championship clubs had the lowest average Index score \u2013 38.1 \u2013 with clubs often spending beyond their means to either chase the Premier League dream or avoid the drop-off in income that follows relegation to League One.Fair Game has lobbied the football authorities to make clubs\u2019 sustainability central to how much funding they receive, as the Premier League, EFL and the Football Association continue their talks on a \u2018New Deal For Football\u2019.Should they be unable to reach an agreement, the Government has said the new independent regulator for English football (IREF) should have backstop powers to impose a settlement via arbitration.Fair Game, which has consistently called for independent regulation, is also lobbying to ensure any backstop settlement includes consideration of how sustainable clubs are.Currently Fair Game says 12 per cent of the Premier League\u2019s annual television income is distributed to the EFL and the wider pyramid.It says this should increase to 25 per cent, and also favours the introduction of a 10 per cent transfer levy on deals involving top-flight clubs, and deals between top-flight clubs and overseas teams.The fan-led review, published in 2021, called for a levy to be brought in but the proposal was not included in the Government\u2019s white paper on football governance published earlier this year.Fair Game has also launched a tool allowing users to calculate how much clubs would earn based on their Fair Game Index score with the distribution percentages as they are now, and how that would change if the percentage increased and a transfer levy was introduced.Fair Game found 92 per cent of clubs outside the Premier League would be better off under its distribution model than the one currently in operation.Fair Game\u2019s chief executive Niall Couper added: \u201cThe Fair Game Index paints a realistic picture of what our game could look like, a future where football chooses to reward well-run clubs.RecommendedMichael van Gerwen\u2019s World Matchplay defence ended by Brendan Dolan in openerJohnny Sexton free to captain Ireland at World Cup after getting three-match banWimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova took inspiration from sponsor snub\u201cFair Game are working hard with communities, experts, football interest groups, fans, clubs and politicians to transform this picture into reality.\u201cFor the first time, the building blocks are in place.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b4f29151ac331ac5b728dd", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/michael-van-gerwen-michael-smith-world-chris-dobey-blackpool-b2376296.html", "primaryCategory": "Sport", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Michael van Gerwen\u2019s World Matchplay defence ended by Brendan Dolan in opener", "lead": "World number one Michael Smith cruised through to the second round, but was far from his best as he beat Steve Beaton 10-2.", "author": "Pa Sport Staff", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 22:30:26", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:37.343217", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T22:30:26+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/16/23/6b4c9fc933ae80a4ba0e643b5a903c5fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjI5Nzg1-2.70383925.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCarlos Alcaraz celebrated a generational shift in tennis after dethroning Novak Djokovic in one of the great Wimbledon finals.The young Spaniard looked to be on his way to victory when he recovered from a nervous start to take a two-sets-to-one lead only for Djokovic to show once again his remarkable powers of resilience.It was he who appeared in the ascendancy at the start of the fifth set but back came 20-year-old Alcaraz to claim a 1-6 7-6 (6) 6-1 3-6 6-4 victory after four hours and 42 minutes, finally landing a meaningful blow for the young guns against the man 16 years his senior.Alcaraz was not even born when Lleyton Hewitt in 2002 became the last man apart from Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray or Djokovic to win the title here, and he is the youngest men\u2019s champion since Boris Becker in 1986.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveAlcaraz won his maiden slam title at the US Open last summer but, having beaten Casper Ruud on that occasion with Djokovic barred from entering the country, there is no question this is a far bigger, and potentially seismic, moment in the men\u2019s game.\u201cI did it for myself, not for the tennis generation,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201c(But) beating Novak at his best, in this stage, making history, being the guy to beat him after 10 years unbeaten on that court, is amazing for me.\u201cIt\u2019s something that I will never forget. It\u2019s great for the new generation, as well, I think, to see me beating him and making them think that they are capable to do it as well.\u201cIt\u2019s the happiest moment of my life. I think it\u2019s not going to change for a long time. Beating Novak, winning the Wimbledon championship, is something that I dream about since I started playing tennis.\u201dThe defeat prevented Djokovic tying Federer with an eighth Wimbledon title, while it also ended his chances of winning the calendar Grand Slam this year and possibly forever, although he will surely have more opportunities to equal Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24 slam crowns.This was the hottest ticket in town. Along with the Prince and Princess of Wales, Prince George and Princess Charlotte and King Felipe VI of Spain, Hollywood stars Brad Pitt, Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig were attendance while, among the tennis ranks, sat in the stands with new men\u2019s doubles champion Neal Skupski, was Murray.The Scot was the last man to beat Djokovic on this court, 10 years and 46 matches ago, in that unforgettable final.The excitement that fizzed around the arena threatened to evaporate as Djokovic pounced on Alcaraz, winning the first five games then the opening set in only 34 minutes.Djokovic had two main regrets after the match, the biggest one being that he was not able to extend his record of consecutive slam tie-breaks won to 16.He led 3-0 and had a set point at 6-5 only to net two routine backhands and then see an Alcaraz return fly past him.In their first slam meeting in the semi-finals of the French Open last month, Alcaraz had been stricken by cramp after a similar first two sets, but here he looked far the better physically as he swept to the third set, breaking Djokovic for a second time in a 26-minute game comprising 13 deuces and seven break points.But Djokovic is the master at rousing himself when he appears down and out and so it proved again.The four-time defending champion had the momentum going into the decider but netted a high volley on break point at 1-0 and then hurled his racket against the net post in anger, smashing the frame, after Alcaraz broke in the next game.Djokovic did all he could to apply pressure as the young Spaniard, who has extended his lead as world number one, stepped up to serve it out but Alcaraz showed what a truly special talent he is by pulling off a precision lob and a reflex volley before slumping to the grass when his opponent finally netted.Serena Williams was celebrating after winning her first Wimbledon title a day earlier.Michael Schumacher won the British Grand Prix for the second time.Elvis vs JXL were the official UK number one with \u2018A Little Less Conversation\u2019.Average pint of lager in UK cost \u00a32.10.Carlos Alcaraz was not born.\u201cProbably before this match I thought that I wasn\u2019t ready to beat Djokovic in five sets, an epic match like this,\u201d said Alcaraz. \u201cI stayed good physically and good mentally about five hours against a legend.\u201dOn learning from what happened in Paris, he added: \u201cI am a totally different player than French Open. I grew up a lot since that moment. I learned a lot from that moment.\u201dDjokovic handled the defeat with impressive grace but broke down in tears when he saw his eight-year-old son Stefan applauding from the stands.He admitted Alcaraz\u2019s remarkably quick progression on grass had taken him by surprise and thought back to the close finals where he has come out on the other side.\u201cI\u2019ve won some epic finals that I was very close to losing,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe this is kind of a fair-and-square deal, I guess, to lose a match like this for me here. Even though it hurts.\u201cCredit to Carlos. Amazing poise in the important moments. For someone of his age to handle the nerves like this, be playing attacking tennis, and to close out the match the way he did. I thought I returned very well that last game, but he was just coming up with some amazing, amazing shots.\u201cSome regrets. I had my chances. I think I could have closed out that second-set tie-breaker better. But credit to him for fighting and showing some incredible defensive skills, passing shots that got him the break in the fifth. He was a deserved winner today.\u201dAlcaraz has a long way to go if he is to have anything like the careers that Djokovic and his long-time rivals Federer and Nadal have put together.But the Serbian could not be more impressed with the 20-year-old as an all-round package, saying: \u201cI think people have been talking in the past 12 months or so about his game consisting of certain elements from Roger, Rafa and myself.\u201cI would agree with that. I think he\u2019s got basically the best of all three worlds. He\u2019s got this Spanish bull mentality of competitiveness and fighting spirit and incredible defence.\u201cI haven\u2019t played a player like him ever, to be honest. Roger and Rafa have their own strengths and weaknesses. Carlos is a very complete player. Amazing adapting capabilities that I think are a key for longevity and for a successful career on all surfaces.\u201dRecommendedSergio Busquets joins former Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi at Inter Miami\u2018Prince of Wimbledon\u2019 is pride of Spain as sporting stars toast Carlos AlcarazWimbledon day 14: Carlos Alcaraz shatters Novak Djokovic\u2019s aura of invincibilityAlcaraz, still wearing his lucky bucket hat, burst into a wide grin when told what Djokovic had said.\u201cIt\u2019s crazy that Novak said that, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know.

defeat in the second ODI at the Ageas Bowl.Victory in Bristol on Wednesday had levelled the multi-format series at 6-6, but Heather Knight\u2019s side knew that only a fourth consecutive win over the world champions would keep alive their hopes of winning back the urn.Put in to bat first in Hampshire, Australia posted 282 for seven with Ellyse Perry hitting 91 and Annabel Sutherland adding 50, but it was Georgia Wareham who changed the momentum with 24 runs off the final over.Tammy Beaumont ensured that England\u2019s chase started strongly with 60, but wickets fell regularly, with the recalled Alana King claiming three for 44 from her 10 overs.Sciver-Brunt\u2019s presence kept alive England\u2019s faint hopes, and she reached another century against Australia, but she could not get the required 15 runs from Jess Jonassen\u2019s final over.RecommendedNo extra pressure on England in penultimate Ashes match \u2013 wicketkeeper Amy JonesTammy Beaumont says belief has been key to England\u2019s Ashes comebackAshes will prove to be a seminal moment for women\u2019s cricket \u2013 Isa GuhaIt puts Australia 8-6 up in the series with only one ODI left to play in Taunton, which means the urn will remain with Alyssa Healy\u2019s side.England captain Knight won the toss and saw her decision to bowl first immediately pay dividends, with Lauren Bell able to claim the early wickets of Phoebe Litchfield and Healy in windy conditions in Hampshire.Litchfield was pinned in front lbw and Healy inexplicably cut straight to Alice Capsey, but Perry and Beth Mooney rebuilt the innings and put on 61 for the third wicket.Spin duo Sophie Ecclestone and Sarah Glenn kept Australia in check, with Mooney sweeping the former to Bell at short fine leg for 33 and Tahlia McGrath out cheaply after edging behind.The outlook could have been even better for England, with Perry dropped on 50 when Glenn put down a tough caught-and-bowled chance, which occurred the ball after the Aussie number three had survived a close lbw appeal.Perry was given another life on 63 when she chipped Ecclestone to Kate Cross at mid-on, but the England seamer put down the opportunity and injured her right leg as a result.Ashleigh Gardner was already out for 33 to Bell by this point, but Australia were able to kick on from 158 for five, with Sutherland improving their tempo.An important 81-run partnership for the sixth wicket was broken in the 47th over by Ecclestone, who claimed Perry for 91 and Sutherland for 50, with substitute fielder Charlie Dean and Capsey taking smart catches on the boundary rope.Wareham crucially swung the momentum back in Australia\u2019s favour, though, with a scintillating onslaught on Bell, smashing two sixes over midwicket after an earlier maximum in the last over of the innings to help her side post 282 for seven from their 50 overs.It left England facing another record ODI chase, after achieving the same feat in Bristol on Wednesday, but Beaumont ensured they made a strong start with 66 put on with Sophia Dunkley, who was then bowled after a scratchy 13.Beaumont had already celebrated 50 before four runs initially awarded to her were later changed to leg byes, but the milestone was officially reached in the 14th over.England\u2019s progress was quickly ground to a halt by leg-spinner King after she won her battle against Knight, who was unhappy to walk off given out lbw for 12 after reviewing immediately.King was in full flow now, and Beaumont was bowled for a fine 60 with a wonderful spinning delivery that clipped off stump before Capsey holed out to deep midwicket where Gardner took the catch.By the time Danni Wyatt succumbed to Gardner\u2019s off-break with a slog sweep straight to Sutherland, England had gone from 107 for two to 144 for five.The presence of Sciver-Brunt, who successfully reviewed an out lbw call on three, retained some hope and she moved to another half-century off 53 balls with a sweep for two.Sciver-Brunt desperately needed a partner to stick around, and wicketkeeper Jones started to take the attack to Australia, hitting back-to-back fours against Wareham, but soon after being dropped on 34, she was out.After putting on 57 for the sixth wicket to take England past the 200 mark, Jones top-edged her attempted reverse sweep and Ecclestone lasted just two balls \u2013 with Gardner picking up two wickets from the 39th over.England still needed 80 runs for victory, but Sciver-Brunt continued to get success with the sweep shot.RecommendedNo extra pressure on England in penultimate

Yeah, obviously disappointment but real pride as well over the fact we got so close.\u201cThe way Nat played was unbelievable. To nearly marshal the tail in that chase was brilliant, but probably left a little bit too much to do.\u201cOverall, we\u2019ve put in another thriller of a performance, but the Ashes are gone which is disappointing.\u201dBefore Sciver-Brunt\u2019s third ODI century against Australia, the big momentum-swinger occurred in the final over of the tourists\u2019 innings.With Australia on a below-par 256 for seven after 49 overs, England would have fancied their chances but Wareham proceeded to hit seamer Bell for three maximums, two over midwicket, and another brace of fours.The 26-run over went a long way to deciding the latest nail-bitter in the series, but Knight backed her young bowler to learn from the experience.\u201cNo, not for me (the most decisive moment). Lauren has been outstanding at the death for us all series, but she is a young bowler, she will make mistakes and have days like that sometimes where it doesn\u2019t quite go right,\u201d Knight added.\u201cI think she will learn a lot from that experience.\n\nIt has got to be the best series there has ever been in the history of the women's gameHeather Knight\u201cThere is a one-day series victory on the line and it would be a really good achievement to win the T20 series and ODI series to draw the series 8-8.\u201cWe have to rally around people, it is obviously quite a quick turnaround and there will be some emotion in that dressing room.\u201cBut we head to Taunton tonight, down to the Holiday Inn and we have a day to regroup and go again. I think if we can end the series on a high, we can have huge pride in how we\u2019ve played throughout the series.\u201dKnight had got England over the line in Wednesday\u2019s opening ODI match in Bristol and admitted it was \u201chorrific\u201d to have no control in this chase.Reflecting on Sciver-Brunt\u2019s innings, Knight added: \u201cIt was kind of written in the stars for her to do it today.\u201cUnfortunately just a little bit too much but great character by her to get us even anywhere close.\u201cIt was another unbelievably entertaining game of cricket and unfortunately we\u2019ve been on the wrong side of this one.\u201dRecommendedSimon Thomas named as Jeff Stelling successor in Soccer Saturday hotseatJonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar separated by 10 seconds going into final weekHenry Searle ready to take on the men\u2019s game after historic Wimbledon winAustralia spinner Alana King, who claimed three for 44, was delighted to retain the Ashes but insisted they want to win the series 10-6.She said: \u201cWe have retained it, which is awesome but as we have said all along, we have come to win it so we have one more game to win the Ashes.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64b4f29451ac331ac5b728e8", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/british-wolverhampton-neal-skupski-laura-robson-jack-draper-b2376187.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Henry Searle ends 61-year wait for British success in Wimbledon boys\u2019 singles", "lead": "The 17-year-old from Wolverhampton emulated Stanley Matthews, son of the famous footballer.", "author": "Jonathan Veal", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 18:39:27", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:40.022913", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T18:39:27+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/16/15/41da7e90f18b9f8a6fbcdc7b78821a0eY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg5NjAxODk3-2.73021020.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWimbledon has a new champion, and a new hero. To break new ground and end Novak Djokovic\u2019s dominance at the All England Club, Carlos Alcaraz had to go to a place no one else had dared to reach, dragging the most successful men\u2019s player of all time into a battle that saw this final live up to its hype and will be remembered as one of the greatest ever staged here.In overturning history, Alcaraz played with a spirit of infectious belief and carried Centre Court with him. The 20-year-old Spaniard met Djokovic head on, denying the Serbian a fifth consecutive Wimbledon title, refusing to go down against the game\u2019s most formidable force and a legend of the sport who had won 104 matches in a row from a set up at the grand slams.A titanic, 26-minute game midway through the third set captured Alcaraz\u2019s stunning resilience and tenacity to believe in the miracle he was trying to accomplish. Already up a break, Alcaraz hunted for another, not once letting Djokovic off the hook. The 36-year-old Djokovic, who had controlled his young opponent magnificently to race to the opening set, was suddenly stressed, rushed, and in danger.He knew what Alcaraz threatened to do. Djokovic had won 34 matches in a row at Wimbledon. He had not lost on Centre Court in 10 years, since losing to Andy Murray in the 2013 final. But he had also not faced an opponent like Alcaraz, a 20-year-old who lives every moment and approaches every shot like he has the chance to make the impossible possible. The second-set tiebreak was another turning point: Djokovic had won 15 tiebreaks in a row coming into the final, Alcaraz, who faced the brink then, barely blinked.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Carlos Alcaraz defeats Novak Djokovic in five-set epic to win men\u2019s finalOne game, 26 minutes, 32 points: Numbers behind Alcaraz and Djokovic\u2019s Wimbledon final epicNovak Djokovic told to \u2018get on with it\u2019 as Wimbledon fans left frustratedTiebreaks are Djokovic\u2019s realm, his palace where he shows his mental fortitude, and a place Alcaraz\u2019s peers dare to tread. Alcaraz ended Djokovic\u2019s reign with his powerful forehand, his dazzling speed and his wondrous creativity. Even as Djokovic forced a fifth, Alcaraz never once lost sight of what he was fighting for. He roared back, and now Wimbledon will never be the same again.He is the new people\u2019s champion: after 21 years of Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray, there is a new name on the illustrious board of winners. And how he deserves it, not only to beat Djokovic in the manner he did, but to close it by staying true to what he wants to bring every time he steps out onto a tennis court. Serving it out, Alcaraz put his signature drop shot into the net on the opening point, only to go for the drop shot again, and then spin the lob over Djokovic\u2019s head. From there, the serve, and a remarkable transition onto grass was complete.Carlos Alcaraz, the new king of Centre Court  (Getty Images)Novak Djokovic was denied a record Wimbledon title  (Getty Images)This, after all, should not be happening, on what is Alcaraz\u2019s fourth tournament on grass. He arrived in London four weeks ago looking to learn and, at first, having to survive on the surface. Just reaching the final was a dream, but what followed will become legend.Like the best finals, there were several contests at once here; matches within sets, sets within games. The meeting of the two best players in the world, separated by age but brought together by their standing at the top of the sport, started with a match that no one expected: a thrashing. Djokovic showed the experience of a 23-time grand slam champion as Alcaraz suffered with nerves. Alcaraz was erratic but, as it so often is, the answer for that was on the other side of the net.Djokovic dominated the opening set to lead Alcaraz  (Getty Images)Djokovic, as solid as a rock, began to toy with his younger opponent, using Alcaraz\u2019s drop shot against him. How that would turn in the latter stages, but as the intensity of the rallies sharpened by the third game, Djokovic remained in complete control. If the defending champion hadn\u2019t been required to get out of third gear throughout these Championships, this was a statement. Djokovic was too quick, too alert even for Alcaraz, and he dominated the rallies.Alcaraz, though, found his confidence and started to display his magnificent shot-making. It came as Djokovic lost track of his serve, with his ball toss causing him particular difficulty in the breeze, reducing his already slow service routine and its endless ball bouncing to a snail\u2019s pace. Yet as Djokovic tightened his game from the baseline and stared down the other end of the court for a reaction, Alcaraz met it dead in the eye, beginning to hit bravely for the lines. It became a different match entirely.But to become an epic one, it needed a twist. In the tiebreak, Djokovic slumped two backhands into the net in a row to give Alcaraz set point. Finally, Djokovic\u2019s vulnerable serve \u2013 which stood at 50 per cent in the second set \u2013 crumbled. Alcaraz attacked it, flashing the backhand winner down the line. Somehow, Alcaraz had overturned the momentum, but he knew there was a long way to go. As the backhand landed, Alcaraz could have roared after it, darting and shouting. Instead he stood, soaked it in, pointed to his head. In control, it was game on.Alcaraz responded after Djokovic won the opening set  (Getty Images)And like all legendary duels on this hallowed court, the details soon faded among the dizzying rallies, the stupefying shots, amid games that lasted an eternity. Somewhere in the fog, a great champion creaked and Djokovic\u2019s third backhand error in quick succession handed Alcaraz the break at the start of the third. Now facing against the tide, Djokovic tried to claw on with all he had, but Alcaraz was unrelenting, outlasting Djokovic in a 32-point game that was almost as long as the opening set.When it was won, Alcaraz roared again,\u00a0and Centre Court believed too. Djokovic saw the set slip away, an unthinkable 6-1 landslide that hinged on a brutal tug of war and threatened to define the final. But Djokovic found a fight from deep within, as well as his serve and unerring return to deconstruct Alcaraz. He forced the fifth, of course he wasn\u2019t done.But then Alcaraz went again. Usually, it is Djokovic who rises in the decider, but Alcaraz found his steel and used it against the Serbian. Alcaraz saved break point with a stunning forehand down the line, then denying Djokovic after he had picked himself up from the grass to try and keep the match alive. Alcaraz, toying with his opponent now, slapping the most extraordinary forehand winner, took the break. Djokovic smashed his racket into the net post, the dream of equalling Federer\u2019s men\u2019s record unravelling, another calendar grand slam up in smoke.Recommended32 points, 26 minutes: Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic\u2019s epic game in numbersNovak Djokovic breaks down in tears as Carlos Alcaraz denies Wimbledon dreamThe sporting weekend in picturesAlacaraz holding a winner\u2019s trophy is likely to become a regular sight  (Getty)This was Alcaraz\u2019s dream and after his stunning rise through the sport, a grand slam champion at 19, the youngest world No 1 of all time, this was a moment to stand above the rest. Alcaraz had pictured it. Just playing the Wimbledon final, he said on Friday, would be the best day of his life. Beating a champion like Djokovic, he said, would be extra special. And then the moment came and it was purer than anything he could have imagined."}, {"_id": "64b4f29451ac331ac5b728ea", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cycling/jonas-vingegaard-tadej-pogacar-adam-yates-tour-de-france-egan-bernal-b2376240.html", "primaryCategory": "Cycling", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Jonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar separated by 10 seconds going into final week", "lead": "Wout Poels took his first career stage win in Saint-Gervais some six minutes before Vingegaard and Pogacar crossed the line shoulder to shoulder.", "author": "Ian Parker", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 17:44:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:40.576633", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T17:44:48+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/16/18/16-bea000209d924bb0a87f9311dfd7192f.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeJonas Vingegaard and Tadej Pogacar will go into the final week of the Tour de France still separated by just 10 seconds after the slopes of Mont Blanc failed to find any difference between the leading duo.Wout Poels, the 35-year-old veteran of 10 Tours, took his first career stage win in Saint-Gervais some six minutes before Vingegaard and Pogacar crossed the line shoulder to shoulder, with Pogacar\u2019s latest attempt to distance the yellow jersey coming to nought.Poels \u2013 who helped Chris Froome, Geraint Thomas and Egan Bernal to Tour titles while with Team Sky and the Ineos Grenadiers \u2013 was the last survivor of a big breakaway that went clear after a crash caused by a spectator reshaped the 179km stage 15 from Les Gets.But as the Dutchman crossed the line, all eyes were further down the mountain. Pogacar was guided towards the summit by team-mate Adam Yates but then gradually let the Lancastrian\u2019s wheel go, seemingly unable to follow as Vingegaard stayed in his shadow.The easing of pace allowed Saturday\u2019s stage winner Carlos Rodriguez to ride back to the pair, with Vingegaard moving on to the young Spaniard\u2019s wheel.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow livePogacar was planning one more attack, but as the Slovenian burst forward just after the flamme rouge, he could not shake Vingegaard, with the Jumbo-Visma rider drawing up alongside on the final bend to ensure he will start Tuesday\u2019s time trial in yellow.\u201cI tried to attack but I could see that Jonas was feeling super good today so I didn\u2019t waste too much energy,\u201d Pogacar said. \u201cThere are still three decisive days but I\u2019m sure it will be very, very tight.\u201dWith Jai Hindley having faded inside the last five kilometres, Rodriguez strengthened his grip on third place, with Yates moving up to fourth ahead of Monday\u2019s rest day.Asked if he had planned to drop Pogacar on the climb, Yates said: \u201cNot really. We had a few issues with the radio. But I\u2019m still high on (general classification) and if Tadej lets me go then Jumbo-Visma have to chase, so it\u2019s kind of still in our favour.\u201cToday was unexpected, but these things add up over the three weeks.\u201dThe peloton had been closely following a series of breakaway attempts in the early part of the stage but, when a young spectator in the road was struck by Vingegaard\u2019s team-mate Sepp Kuss 50km in, around a dozen riders went down, slowing the main group and allowing almost 40 riders to get away.\u201cThere was a narrowing in the town and a spectator in the road, and I guess he just clipped my handlebars,\u201d said Kuss, his elbow heavily bandaged. \u201cLuckily I\u2019m OK and hopefully the other guys in the crash are all right. It\u2019s not ideal.\u201cI think it\u2019s fatigue. It\u2019s been such a hard race and everybody is a bit tired, you lose a bit of alertness and there\u2019s always things out of your control as well.\u201dPoels\u2019 victory is a second of the race for the Bahrain-Victorious team, who came to this Tour still mourning the death of Gino Mader at the Tour de Suisse last month.\u201cI always dreamed to win a stage in the Tour and especially with what has happened in the team in the last few weeks with Gino, all of the emotions come,\u201d Poels said.RecommendedHenry Searle ready to take on the men\u2019s game after historic Wimbledon winHarry Maguire has Manchester United captaincy taken off him by Erik ten HagRory McIlroy hopes stunning Scottish Open win sets him up for Hoylake success\u201cI\u2019ve won a Monument, I\u2019ve won a stage in the Tour and I\u2019m super happy.

Hopefully they can continue to be like that over the years.\u201dSearle\u2019s ability to serve at a speed that would thrive on the men\u2019s tour comes down to a finely tuned technique and a growth spurt.His coach Morgan Phillips said: \u201cA lot of that serve comes from his technique and long arms, but a bit of extra firepower is going to put a few more miles per hour on that serve.\u201cHe\u2019s filling out now, definitely. He\u2019s all been arms and legs and that growth spurt threw off his co-ordination as it does.\u201cBut I think he\u2019s getting closer to stopping.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWout Poels celebrated his first career grand tour stage win as the slopes of Mont Blanc failed to find any difference between Tour de France leader Jonas Vingegaard and his rival Tadej Pogacar.Poels, 35, was the last survivor of a big breakaway group that got clear after a crash caused by a spectator reshaped the 179km stage 15 from Les Gets to Saint-Gervais.Six minutes after the Bahrain-Victorious rider crossed the line, Vingegaard and Pogacar came home shoulder to shoulder, with Vingegaard\u2019s advantage in yellow remaining at 10 seconds going into Monday\u2019s rest day.Pogacar was guided towards the summit by team-mate Adam Yates but then gradually let the wheel go, seemingly unable to follow as Vingegaard stayed in his shadow.The easing of pace allowed Saturday\u2019s winner Carlos Rodriguez to ride back to the pair, with Vingegaard moving on to the Spaniard\u2019s wheel.RecommendedTour de France 2023 stage 15 preview: Route map and profile of 179km from Les Gets to St Gervais Mont BlancCarlos Rodriguez wins maiden Tour stage as Tadej Pogacar rues \u2018wasted bullet\u2019Pogacar was planning one more attack, but as the Slovenian burst forward just after the flamme rouge, he could not shake Vingegaard, with the Jumbo-Visma rider drawing up alongside on the final bend to ensure he will start Tuesday\u2019s time trial in yellow.With Jai Hindley having faded, Rodriguez strengthened his grip on third place, with Yates moving up to fourth.Asked if he had planned to drop Pogacar on the climb, Yates said: \u201cNot really. We had a few issues with the radio. But I\u2019m still high on (general classification) and if Tadej lets me go then Jumbo-Visma have to chase, so it\u2019s kind of still in our favour.\u201cToday was unexpected, but these things add up over the three weeks.\u201dThe peloton had been closely following a series of breakaway attempts in the early part of the stage but, when a young spectator in the road was struck by Vingegaard\u2019s team-mate Sepp Kuss 50km in, around a dozen riders went down, slowing the main group and allowing almost 40 riders to get away.\u201cThere was a narrowing in the town and a spectator in the road, and I guess he just clipped my handlebars,\u201d said Kuss, his elbow heavily bandaged. \u201cLuckily I\u2019m OK and hopefully the other guys in the crash are all right. It\u2019s not ideal.\u201cI think it\u2019s fatigue.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRory McIlroy completed the ideal preparation for the 151st Open as he produced a stunning finish to deny home favourite Robert MacIntyre in dramatic circumstances in the Genesis Scottish Open.MacIntyre had set a daunting target of 14 under par thanks to a sensational birdie on the 18th, just the second of the day on the closing hole at the Renaissance Club as strong winds made for testing scoring conditions.However, overnight leader McIlroy birdied the par-three 17th to get on level terms and then hit a stunning 2-iron approach into the last before holing from 10 feet to complete a closing 68 and win his second Rolex Series title of the year.McIlroy, who will head into next week\u2019s Open Championship at Royal Liverpool, scene of his 2014 triumph, on the back of his first win on Scottish soil, said: \u201cI\u2019m really proud.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cThat was such a tough day, especially the back nine.

It\u2019s been a sort of long six months I feel since I won in Dubai. I\u2019ve given myself tonnes of chances and hopefully this win sort of breaks the seal for me, especially going in to next week as well.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have the validation. It\u2019s great racking up top fives and top 10s, but it\u2019s much nicer heading away with a trophy on a Sunday afternoon.\u201cIt\u2019s a great shot of confidence and helps having something fresh in my memory. If I hopefully find myself in a similar position next week where I have a chance to win with nine holes to go, I can certainly draw on what I did here.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Hoylake since 2014 so I\u2019ll get out on the course on Monday and try to figure it out and make sure I\u2019m ready.\u201dMacIntyre began the final round five shots behind McIlroy but made good on his promise to relish \u201cabsolutely brutal\u201d weather as he followed birdies on the third and sixth with an eagle on the par-five 10th.A birdie on the 14th moved the left-hander into the outright lead for the first time as pacesetter Tyrrell Hatton began to falter \u2013 and he immediately doubled his advantage after a superb approach to the next finished inches from the hole.McIlroy kept himself in contention with a birdie on the 11th and, after MacIntyre bogeyed the par-five 16th, the Northern Irishman holed from almost 40 feet on the 14th to share the lead.MacIntyre was fortunate to find the spectator walkway following a wild drive on the 18th, but took full advantage by hitting a stunning approach with a fairway wood to within four feet of the hole.The resulting birdie completed a superb 64 but, having gone to the turn in 37, McIlroy came home in 31 \u2013 despite failing to birdie either par five \u2013 to snatch an unlikely victory.\u201cIt was a poor tee-shot on the 18th, but then probably the best shot I have ever hit in my life,\u201d MacIntyre said.\u201cI thought it might be enough, but that\u2019s what happens when you are playing against the best in the world. I\u2019ve grown up watching Scottish Opens and my dream was always to win one.\u201cI thought today might have been the day, but it wasn\u2019t to be. I\u2019m absolutely gutted just now, but I take my hat off to Rory. What a finish.\u201dMacIntyre had fought back tears as he walked off the 18th green contemplating what looked like being a third DP World Tour title worth \u00a31.2million and a two-year PGA Tour exemption.\u201cI have never had support like that in my life,\u201d he added. \u201cHaving the support of family and friends is massive. But it felt like everyone out there was willing me to do it.\u201cI was struggling for a wee bit there, I didn\u2019t have the love for the game, I didn\u2019t have the buzz, I was never in contention, I was pottering about middle of the table.\u201cThe last wee while I have been in contention, I have got the buzz back. It would have been one hell of a celebration but it wasn\u2019t to be just now.\u201dThe runners-up finish is still a massive boost to MacIntyre\u2019s chances of securing a Ryder Cup debut in Rome and McIlroy was full of praise for the 26-year-old.RecommendedHenry Searle ends 61-year wait for British success in Wimbledon boys\u2019 singlesLois Toulson and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix win historic world diving medalEngland \u2018not worried\u2019 about lack of goals ahead of Women\u2019s World Cup\u201cIf he can shoot 64 on a day like today he can do anything,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThat was an unbelievable round of golf.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNovak Djokovic might be as well-known for his off-court controversies as his tennis brilliance. The case of his detention and deportation from Australia drew worldwide attention and sparked anger in his homeland, Serbia. His father, Srdjan, remained adamant that Djokovic was \u201cthe Spartacus of the new world\u201d and that \u201che is like water and water paves its own path\u201d.His father\u2019s reaction may be indicative, but Djokovic\u2019s unorthodox world view and scepticism of societal norms have been advertised, and self-promoted, for several years. After all, it was in his own book, Serve to Win, that he detailed the moment his transformative gluten-free diet began in 2010, when he self-diagnosed a celiac allergy by pressing a slice of bread against his abdomen.The true depth of Djokovic\u2019s belief in alternative treatments was epitomised by his vehement opposition to undergoing surgery in 2017. Despite struggling with a near-intolerable pain in his elbow, which led to Djokovic failing to reach a grand slam semi-final in a calendar year for the first time in over a decade, he was insistent that a cure could be found through holistic medicine. When he eventually succumbed in February 2018, Djokovic claimed he cried for three days after waking up from the operation. \u201cEvery time I thought about what I did, I felt like I had failed myself,\u201d he said. He has won eight of the 14 grand slams that have been played since.Those credences help put into context why Djokovic is so resistant to taking the vaccine. He is not so much an anti-vaxxer in the sense of indulging wild conspiracy theories relating specifically to the jab but ideologically opposed to such methods of scientific treatment across the board. \u201cPersonally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn\u2019t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,\u201d he said in April 2020.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz in men\u2019s final after shock Marketa Vondrousova winCarlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic final has all the ingredients for a Wimbledon classicWhat time is the Wimbledon men\u2019s final?Djokovic is a genius of his field, and certainly no jester. He is, by most measures, wildly intelligent, a deep thinker, and commands the respect of his fellow players. Perhaps, then, the point is what proportion are genuine, obstinate beliefs, and what are actually potentially contrived \u2013 an innate suspicion of convention that has been moulded into a competitive edge; the us-against-them mentality that\u2019s enabled him to best harness his talent and become one of the greatest sportsmen in modern history.Novak Djokovic won his 23rd grand slam title at the French Open  (Getty Images)In the past, Djokovic has often spoken about coping mechanisms and the value of \u201cmental strength\u201d to comprehend his childhood in the war-torn former Yugoslavia. The 11-year-old boy and his family sheltered in the basement of his grandfather\u2019s flat during Nato\u2019s bombing raids on Belgrade in 1999. He still practised his tennis, but had to move to a different site each day. He was eventually spotted in the mountain resort of Kopaonik, where his parents owned a pizzeria, by Jelena Gencic, who ran tennis camps there \u2013 and invited to play.\u201cAfter three days I met his parents,\u201d Gencic \u2013 who died in 2013 \u2013 recalled later to The Independent\u2019s Paul Newman. \u201cI said to them: \u2018You have a golden child.\u2019\u201d Djokovic\u2019s \u201ctennis mother\u201d would also encourage his interest in classical music and languages.He needed mental strength to handle the burden of being a child prodigy and the extremes of junior tennis and into his senior career. He won his first grand slam title, at the Australian Open, at 20, but his physical abilities were sometimes questioned over the next few years \u2013 that previously mentioned change in his diet was one factor in 2010 that Djokovic said had pushed him on. Another you could mark was was Serbia\u2019s 2010 victory in the Davis Cup, the national competition. Serbia won the trophy for the first time, with now-Monaco resident Djokovic always being proud of being a sporting ambassador for his country. Djokovic would go on to have a title-laden 2011 and spring forward from there.\n\nHe is the Robin Hood of tennisGoran IvanisevicDuring that time, he\u2019s formed his own perspectives and built his own walls to the outside world in pursuit of a singular objective. Take the surgery saga of 2017, when Djokovic insisted a persistent elbow injury should be treated by holistic methods. After eventually resigning himself to surgery, he claimed he \u201ccried for three days straight\u201d. In his eyes, by letting the will of the outside world triumph over his own, he\u2019d \u201cfailed\u201d.It\u2019s easy to see how those traits have transferred into Djokovic\u2019s tennis, too, particularly when he is backed into a corner. In the third round at Wimbledon 2018, for example, when he was jeered by Centre Court after receiving a time violation against home favourite Kyle Edmund. He became consumed by a visceral anger, blowing kisses to the crowd, and barely let down his guard until he clinched a fourth title eight days later. As the irrepressible third wheel to Roger Federer and Nadal, he has perennially been cast as the villain. Djokovic \u2013 who has a son and a daughter with his wife Jelena \u2013 has given millions to charity, but his public image is not the same as Federer and Nadal. It was not helped by the exhibition Adria Tour in Serbia and Croatia in the summer of 2020 when the ATP Tour had shut down. Several players contacted Covid during the Djokovic-fronted event and arrangements faced criticism from a number of quarters.More recently he has become embroiled in issues of politics, defending his father by insisting he did not intend to pose for pictures with supporters of Vladimir Putin at the Australian Open. Srdjan was filmed standing next to a Russian flag with Putin\u2019s face on it, and a man who wore the \u2018Z\u2019 logo that indicates support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Novak Djokovic\u2019s father Srdjan, centre, appeared at a pro-Russian demonstration (Anthony Devlin/PA) (PA Archive)Then at this year\u2019s French Open, Djokovic wrote on a camera lens: \u201cKosovo is the heart of Serbia. Stop the violence.\u201d Kosovo declared independence in 2008 but Serbia has never recognised that and violence recently broke out in the north of the country. Serbia has troops stationed near the border and there are fears of a return to the violent conflict of 1998-99.Speaking to Serbian journalists in comments reported by the country\u2019s media, Djokovic said: \u201cI am not a politician, nor do I intend to enter into debates. As a Serb, it hurts me what is happening in Kosovo. Our people have been expelled from the municipalities. This is the least I could do. As a public figure, I feel an obligation to show support for our people and all of Serbia.\u201cI hear there was a lot of criticism on social media. I don\u2019t know if someone will punish me or something like that, but I would do it again. I am against wars and conflicts of any kind.\u201dOne of Djokovic\u2019s coaches, the former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, believes the player is misunderstood. \u201cSometimes people only pick out the bad things he does,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cThey don\u2019t see the good he does in helping others. He is the person who is not afraid to speak out, the only tennis player who stands up for the other players. He is the Robin Hood of tennis.\u201dIvanisevic believes the tennis world \u2013 and others \u2013 will miss Djokovic when he retires from the sport.For Djokovic, you feel the situation in Australia was just the next step in the contradiction that has underlined his career. There has always been precious little to differentiate the man from the athlete. His stubborn single-mindedness \u2013 or selfishness \u2013 has been integral in him becoming such a remarkable player.RecommendedDjokovic told to \u2018get on with it\u2019 as Wimbledon fans left frustrated by his serveWimbledon 2023 finalist Carlos Alcaraz in profileCarlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic final has the ingredients for a Wimbledon classicIt has led to his extraordinary dominance at Wimbledon later in his career. On Sunday, Djokovic could join Federer by becoming the most successful men\u2019s player ever at the All England Club with a record-equalling eighth men\u2019s singles title. His record at the Championships often intimidates his opponents: the 36-year-old has not lost at Wimbledon since 2017 and has not lost on Centre Court in over 10 years. The frightening truth about the Serbian is he also seems to be getting better with age.

The final features the widest age gap between two men\u2019s grand slam finalists in 48 years, and the young Spaniard is faced with the toughest challenge in tennis; Djokovic has won 34 consecutive matches at Wimbledon, he has not lost at the tournament since 2017, and not on Centre Court since 2013.Having won the US Open final last year to claim his first major title at the age of just 19, Alcaraz now stands on the precipice of a victory that would truly announce the Spaniard as the next great player in the sport.His win in New York came only 18 months after Alcaraz made his tour debut, and it made him the youngest ever men\u2019s world No 1. Adding Wimbledon, which would see Alcaraz become the first men\u2019s champion at the All England Club outside of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray since 2002, would signify Alcaraz as a worthy successor as he begins to follow in their illustrious footsteps.Alcaraz is still only 20, and he had never reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon until he overcame former runner-up Matteo Berrettini this week, setting up a last-eight clash with Holger Rune, which Alcaraz won in straight sets. Alcaraz then dispatched Daniil Medvedev in straight sets to reach his fiirst Wimbledon final, on what is just his fourth tournament on grass. Alcaraz, who grew up in El Parmar in Murcia, is a Spanish rarity as a right-handed player, and he has won a total of 11 tour-level titles, including his US Open crown and four Masters successes. His Miami (2022) and Madrid Masters (2023) titles mark him out as the youngest champion at both tournaments.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz in men\u2019s final after shock Marketa Vondrousova winCarlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic final has all the ingredients for a Wimbledon classicWhat time is the Wimbledon men\u2019s final?The Spaniard\u2019s game is characterised by aggressive baseline play, and he has quickly become known for his athleticism and his daring and inventive shot-making. In his four-set win against Berrettini his week, for example, Alcaraz pulled off a stunning winner around the net post. He also possesses one of the most effective drop shots in the sport.Alcaraz has also been compared to a young Rafael Nadal, and the 22-time slam champion said of his compatriot after a clash in 2022: \u201cWhen his adrenaline goes up, he\u2019s practically unstoppable.\u201d Alcaraz may appear to be a right-handed reincarnation of Nadal, who was his idol growing up in Murcia, but he says his game is more like Roger Federer\u2019s.The youngster is also driven by the words of his grandfather and the three Cs: cabeza, coraz\u00f3n, cojones\u2013 head, heart and balls \u2013 and he had \u201cCCC\u201d tattooed on his arm after winning the US Open in September.Earlier this week, Alcaraz was forced to respond to reports that his father Carlos, a regular member of his entourage, recorded Novak Djokovic \u2013 who he is seeded to meet in the final \u2013 while the seven-time champion was training at Wimbledon\u2019s Aorangi Park. \u201cOh, probably it is true,\u201d said the world No 1. \u201cMy father is a huge fan of tennis.

On Saturday, the unseeded 24-year-old Czech, Marketa Vondrousova, swept past crowd favourite Ons Jabeur to lift the Venus Rosewater Plate on Centre Court. She won in straight sets and couldn\u2019t believe how she\u2019d managed to pull off the feat almost a year after wrist surgery. Yesterday was the men\u2019s singles final. Carlos Alcaraz went up against Novak Djokovic and fought through a five-set thriller. Djokovic, aiming to win his fifth title in a row and eighth overall, took the first set in rapid fashion but Alcaraz dug deep and nicked the second in a tiebreak. By the end of the fourth the match was level yet an early break of Djokovic\u2019s serve in the deciding set gave Alcaraz the advantage and he made sure to keep. The 20-year-old sealed his victory and inflicted a first Centre Court defeat on Novak Djokovic in a decade. Magnificent stuff.

I grew up a lot since that moment. I learned a lot from that moment.\u201cI took lesson from that match. I did something different before the match. I prepared a little bit different mentally before the match. I could deal with the pressure, the nerves, better than I did in French Open.\u201cI think was the mental part that allow me to stay there during the five sets.\u201dJamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:331689538534Carlos Alcaraz is here, and is very much still in shock after winning the Wimbledon final: \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true for me, being a Wimbledon champion, something that I really wanted.

I would agree with that. I think he\u2019s got basically best of all three worlds.\u201cHe\u2019s got this mental resilience and really maturity for someone who is 20 years old. It\u2019s quite impressive. He\u2019s got this Spanish bull mentality of competitiveness and fighting spirit and incredible defense that we\u2019ve seen with Rafa over the years.\u201cAnd I think he\u2019s got some nice sliding backhands that he\u2019s got some similarities with my backhands. Yeah, two-handed backhands, defense, being able to adapt. I think that has been my personal strength for many years. He has it, too.\u201cI haven\u2019t played a player like him ever, to be honest. Roger and Rafa have their own obviously strengths and weaknesses. Carlos is very complete player.

We\u2019ve had a lot of games under Sarina (Wiegman), we\u2019ve had a lot of different goalscorers who have scored so many goals, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that we\u2019re worried about.RecommendedWho are the threats to the Lionesses at the Women\u2019s World Cup?Can Spain regroup from mutiny to challenge for the Women\u2019s World Cup?The inspiration behind Australia\u2019s shot at home World Cup glory\u201cLike I say, we\u2019ve had time off, we\u2019ve come back together, we\u2019re learning how to play with each other again, we\u2019re finding those connections on the pitch and we\u2019re having those chances.\u201cI think I\u2019d be more worried if the chances weren\u2019t coming. It\u2019s now about us putting them away, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s had a massive effect on us. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re dwelling on that.\u201cWe\u2019re very confident and we know we\u2019ve got a lot of goalscorers in the group as well, so we\u2019re definitely creating those chances. It\u2019s now about making sure we put them in the back of the net.\u201dElla Toone insists England have no concerns about their lack of goals ahead of the Women\u2019s World Cup (PA). (PA Wire)Friday\u2019s match-up against seventh-ranked Canada was not for official records and not a formal fixture.Almost all of Wiegman\u2019s 23-woman squad saw some action, save goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck and forward Bethany England.The decision not to play England, who was in Wiegman\u2019s European Championship-winning squad but did not see any game time \u2013 started the social media rumour mill swirling, but the Tottenham striker appeared to be in good health as she fully trained with the squad on Saturday.A total of 19 Lionesses were out on the pitch at the Sunshine Coast Stadium session, while Millie Bright, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Lauren James, Rachel Daly, Esme Morgan and Keira Walsh had a recovery day.On Monday the team will swap seaside for city when they move into their Brisbane hotel ahead of their meeting with Haiti, who sit 53rd in the world rankings.It seems Toone, who scored the first of England\u2019s two goals in the 2-1 Euro 2022 final, will be especially sorry to say goodbye to the Sunshine Coast after a personally transformative time here.\n\nI've actually started reading so that's nice.

We\u2019ve had a lot of games under Sarina (Wiegman), we\u2019ve had a lot of different goalscorers who have scored so many goals, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that we\u2019re worried about.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cLike I say, we\u2019ve had time off, we\u2019ve come back together, we\u2019re learning how to play with each other again, we\u2019re finding those connections on the pitch and we\u2019re having those chances.\u201cI think I\u2019d be more worried if the chances weren\u2019t coming.

It\u2019s now about making sure we put them in the back of the net.\u201dFriday\u2019s match-up against seventh-ranked Canada was not for official records and not a formal fixture.Almost all of Wiegman\u2019s 23-woman squad saw some action, save goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck and forward Bethany England.The decision not to play England, who was in Wiegman\u2019s European Championship-winning squad but did not see any game time \u2013 started the social media rumour mill swirling, but the Tottenham striker appeared to be in good health as she fully trained with the squad on Saturday.A total of 19 Lionesses were out on the pitch at the Sunshine Coast Stadium session, while Millie Bright, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Lauren James, Rachel Daly, Esme Morgan and Keira Walsh had a recovery day.On Monday the team will swap seaside for city when they move into their Brisbane hotel ahead of their meeting with Haiti, who sit 53rd in the world rankings.It seems Toone, who scored the first of England\u2019s two goals in the 2-1 Euro 2022 final, will be especially sorry to say goodbye to the Sunshine Coast after a personally transformative time here.\n\nI've actually started reading so that's nice.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeNovak Djokovic might be as well-known for his off-court controversies as his tennis brilliance. The case of his detention and deportation from Australia drew worldwide attention and sparked anger in his homeland, Serbia. His father, Srdjan, remained adamant that Djokovic was \u201cthe Spartacus of the new world\u201d and that \u201che is like water and water paves its own path\u201d.His father\u2019s reaction may be indicative, but Djokovic\u2019s unorthodox world view and scepticism of societal norms have been advertised, and self-promoted, for several years. After all, it was in his own book, Serve to Win, that he detailed the moment his transformative gluten-free diet began in 2010, when he self-diagnosed a celiac allergy by pressing a slice of bread against his abdomen.The true depth of Djokovic\u2019s belief in alternative treatments was epitomised by his vehement opposition to undergoing surgery in 2017. Despite struggling with a near-intolerable pain in his elbow, which led to Djokovic failing to reach a grand slam semi-final in a calendar year for the first time in over a decade, he was insistent that a cure could be found through holistic medicine. When he eventually succumbed in February 2018, Djokovic claimed he cried for three days after waking up from the operation. \u201cEvery time I thought about what I did, I felt like I had failed myself,\u201d he said. He has won eight of the 14 grand slams that have been played since.Those credences help put into context why Djokovic is so resistant to taking the vaccine. He is not so much an anti-vaxxer in the sense of indulging wild conspiracy theories relating specifically to the jab but ideologically opposed to such methods of scientific treatment across the board. \u201cPersonally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn\u2019t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,\u201d he said in April 2020.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz in men\u2019s final after shock Marketa Vondrousova winCarlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic final has all the ingredients for a Wimbledon classicWhat time is the Wimbledon men\u2019s final?Djokovic is a genius of his field, and certainly no jester. He is, by most measures, wildly intelligent, a deep thinker, and commands the respect of his fellow players. Perhaps, then, the point is what proportion are genuine, obstinate beliefs, and what are actually potentially contrived \u2013 an innate suspicion of convention that has been moulded into a competitive edge; the us-against-them mentality that\u2019s enabled him to best harness his talent and become one of the greatest sportsmen in modern history.Novak Djokovic won his 23rd grand slam title at the French Open  (Getty Images)In the past, Djokovic has often spoken about coping mechanisms and the value of \u201cmental strength\u201d to comprehend his childhood in the war-torn former Yugoslavia. The 11-year-old boy and his family sheltered in the basement of his grandfather\u2019s flat during Nato\u2019s bombing raids on Belgrade in 1999. He still practised his tennis, but had to move to a different site each day. He was eventually spotted in the mountain resort of Kopaonik, where his parents owned a pizzeria, by Jelena Gencic, who ran tennis camps there \u2013 and invited to play.\u201cAfter three days I met his parents,\u201d Gencic \u2013 who died in 2013 \u2013 recalled later to The Independent\u2019s Paul Newman. \u201cI said to them: \u2018You have a golden child.\u2019\u201d Djokovic\u2019s \u201ctennis mother\u201d would also encourage his interest in classical music and languages.He needed mental strength to handle the burden of being a child prodigy and the extremes of junior tennis and into his senior career. He won his first grand slam title, at the Australian Open, at 20, but his physical abilities were sometimes questioned over the next few years \u2013 that previously mentioned change in his diet was one factor in 2010 that Djokovic said had pushed him on. Another you could mark was was Serbia\u2019s 2010 victory in the Davis Cup, the national competition. Serbia won the trophy for the first time, with now-Monaco resident Djokovic always being proud of being a sporting ambassador for his country. Djokovic would go on to have a title-laden 2011 and spring forward from there.\n\nHe is the Robin Hood of tennisGoran IvanisevicDuring that time, he\u2019s formed his own perspectives and built his own walls to the outside world in pursuit of a singular objective. Take the surgery saga of 2017, when Djokovic insisted a persistent elbow injury should be treated by holistic methods. After eventually resigning himself to surgery, he claimed he \u201ccried for three days straight\u201d. In his eyes, by letting the will of the outside world triumph over his own, he\u2019d \u201cfailed\u201d.It\u2019s easy to see how those traits have transferred into Djokovic\u2019s tennis, too, particularly when he is backed into a corner. In the third round at Wimbledon 2018, for example, when he was jeered by Centre Court after receiving a time violation against home favourite Kyle Edmund. He became consumed by a visceral anger, blowing kisses to the crowd, and barely let down his guard until he clinched a fourth title eight days later. As the irrepressible third wheel to Roger Federer and Nadal, he has perennially been cast as the villain. Djokovic \u2013 who has a son and a daughter with his wife Jelena \u2013 has given millions to charity, but his public image is not the same as Federer and Nadal. It was not helped by the exhibition Adria Tour in Serbia and Croatia in the summer of 2020 when the ATP Tour had shut down. Several players contacted Covid during the Djokovic-fronted event and arrangements faced criticism from a number of quarters.More recently he has become embroiled in issues of politics, defending his father by insisting he did not intend to pose for pictures with supporters of Vladimir Putin at the Australian Open. Srdjan was filmed standing next to a Russian flag with Putin\u2019s face on it, and a man who wore the \u2018Z\u2019 logo that indicates support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Novak Djokovic\u2019s father Srdjan, centre, appeared at a pro-Russian demonstration (Anthony Devlin/PA) (PA Archive)Then at this year\u2019s French Open, Djokovic wrote on a camera lens: \u201cKosovo is the heart of Serbia. Stop the violence.\u201d Kosovo declared independence in 2008 but Serbia has never recognised that and violence recently broke out in the north of the country. Serbia has troops stationed near the border and there are fears of a return to the violent conflict of 1998-99.Speaking to Serbian journalists in comments reported by the country\u2019s media, Djokovic said: \u201cI am not a politician, nor do I intend to enter into debates. As a Serb, it hurts me what is happening in Kosovo. Our people have been expelled from the municipalities. This is the least I could do. As a public figure, I feel an obligation to show support for our people and all of Serbia.\u201cI hear there was a lot of criticism on social media. I don\u2019t know if someone will punish me or something like that, but I would do it again. I am against wars and conflicts of any kind.\u201dOne of Djokovic\u2019s coaches, the former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, believes the player is misunderstood. \u201cSometimes people only pick out the bad things he does,\u201d he told The Times. \u201cThey don\u2019t see the good he does in helping others. He is the person who is not afraid to speak out, the only tennis player who stands up for the other players. He is the Robin Hood of tennis.\u201dIvanisevic believes the tennis world \u2013 and others \u2013 will miss Djokovic when he retires from the sport.For Djokovic, you feel the situation in Australia was just the next step in the contradiction that has underlined his career. There has always been precious little to differentiate the man from the athlete. His stubborn single-mindedness \u2013 or selfishness \u2013 has been integral in him becoming such a remarkable player.RecommendedDjokovic told to \u2018get on with it\u2019 as Wimbledon fans left frustrated by his serveWimbledon 2023 finalist Carlos Alcaraz in profileCarlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic final has the ingredients for a Wimbledon classicIt has led to his extraordinary dominance at Wimbledon later in his career. On Sunday, Djokovic could join Federer by becoming the most successful men\u2019s player ever at the All England Club with a record-equalling eighth men\u2019s singles title. His record at the Championships often intimidates his opponents: the 36-year-old has not lost at Wimbledon since 2017 and has not lost on Centre Court in over 10 years. The frightening truth about the Serbian is he also seems to be getting better with age.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCarlos Alcaraz will attempt to end Novak Djokovic\u2019s reign in the Wimbledon men\u2019s final today in a battle of youth against experience for the SW19 crown. The final features the widest age gap between two men\u2019s grand slam finalists in 48 years, and the young Spaniard is faced with the toughest challenge in tennis; Djokovic has won 34 consecutive matches at Wimbledon, he has not lost at the tournament since 2017, and not on Centre Court since 2013.Having won the US Open final last year to claim his first major title at the age of just 19, Alcaraz now stands on the precipice of a victory that would truly announce the Spaniard as the next great player in the sport.His win in New York came only 18 months after Alcaraz made his tour debut, and it made him the youngest ever men\u2019s world No 1. Adding Wimbledon, which would see Alcaraz become the first men\u2019s champion at the All England Club outside of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray since 2002, would signify Alcaraz as a worthy successor as he begins to follow in their illustrious footsteps.Alcaraz is still only 20, and he had never reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon until he overcame former runner-up Matteo Berrettini this week, setting up a last-eight clash with Holger Rune, which Alcaraz won in straight sets. Alcaraz then dispatched Daniil Medvedev in straight sets to reach his fiirst Wimbledon final, on what is just his fourth tournament on grass. Alcaraz, who grew up in El Parmar in Murcia, is a Spanish rarity as a right-handed player, and he has won a total of 11 tour-level titles, including his US Open crown and four Masters successes. His Miami (2022) and Madrid Masters (2023) titles mark him out as the youngest champion at both tournaments.RecommendedWimbledon 2023 LIVE: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz in men\u2019s final after shock Marketa Vondrousova winCarlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic final has all the ingredients for a Wimbledon classicWhat time is the Wimbledon men\u2019s final?The Spaniard\u2019s game is characterised by aggressive baseline play, and he has quickly become known for his athleticism and his daring and inventive shot-making. In his four-set win against Berrettini his week, for example, Alcaraz pulled off a stunning winner around the net post. He also possesses one of the most effective drop shots in the sport.Alcaraz has also been compared to a young Rafael Nadal, and the 22-time slam champion said of his compatriot after a clash in 2022: \u201cWhen his adrenaline goes up, he\u2019s practically unstoppable.\u201d Alcaraz may appear to be a right-handed reincarnation of Nadal, who was his idol growing up in Murcia, but he says his game is more like Roger Federer\u2019s.The youngster is also driven by the words of his grandfather and the three Cs: cabeza, coraz\u00f3n, cojones\u2013 head, heart and balls \u2013 and he had \u201cCCC\u201d tattooed on his arm after winning the US Open in September.Earlier this week, Alcaraz was forced to respond to reports that his father Carlos, a regular member of his entourage, recorded Novak Djokovic \u2013 who he is seeded to meet in the final \u2013 while the seven-time champion was training at Wimbledon\u2019s Aorangi Park. \u201cOh, probably it is true,\u201d said the world No 1. \u201cMy father is a huge fan of tennis. He doesn\u2019t only watch my matches. I think he gets into the club at 11am, gets out at 10pm, watching matches, watching practice from everyone.

Before the final, Djokovic had won 34 consecutive matches at Wimbledon and had not lost on Centre Court since 2013, but Alcaraz overturned history to win his second grand slam title. Djokovic had also won his previous 104 grand slam matches after winning the opening set.In doing so, the 20-year-old Spaniard brings one of the most dominant eras of tennis history to an end. Alcaraz is the first player outside of the sport\u2019s \u2018big four\u2019 of Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray to win the Wimbledon men\u2019s singles title since 2002.

To break new ground and end Novak Djokovic\u2019s dominance at the All England Club, Carlos Alcaraz had to go to a place no one else had dared to reach, dragging the most successful men\u2019s player of all time into a battle that saw this final live up to its hype and will be remembered as one of the greatest ever staged here.In overturning history, Alcaraz played with a spirit of infectious belief and carried Centre Court with him. The 20-year-old Spaniard met Djokovic head on, denying the Serbian a fifth consecutive Wimbledon title, refusing to go down against the game\u2019s most formidable force and a legend of the sport who had won 104 matches in a row from a set up at the grand slams.Carlos Alcaraz captures the impossible and now Wimbledon will never be the same againCarlos Alcaraz not only became the champion of SW19 when he defeated Novak Djokovic, but the people\u2019s champion as well Mike Jones17 July 2023 08:221689578208Good morningWimbledon 2023 is over and after two weeks of incredible tennis, rain interruptions, wonderful success and tear-inducing heartbreaks there are two new champions at SW19. On Saturday, the unseeded 24-year-old Czech, Marketa Vondrousova, swept past crowd favourite Ons Jabeur to lift the Venus Rosewater Plate on Centre Court. She won in straight sets and couldn\u2019t believe how she\u2019d managed to pull off the feat almost a year after wrist surgery. Yesterday was the men\u2019s singles final. Carlos Alcaraz went up against Novak Djokovic and fought through a five-set thriller. Djokovic, aiming to win his fifth title in a row and eighth overall, took the first set in rapid fashion but Alcaraz dug deep and nicked the second in a tiebreak. By the end of the fourth the match was level yet an early break of Djokovic\u2019s serve in the deciding set gave Alcaraz the advantage and he made sure to keep. The 20-year-old sealed his victory and inflicted a first Centre Court defeat on Novak Djokovic in a decade. Magnificent stuff. Mike Jones17 July 2023 08:161689540887Carlos Alcaraz: \u201cIt\u2019s big moment not just for me, but for my family, for all the people around me. It\u2019s really, really special moment.\u201cI start playing tennis thanks my dad. Really huge fan of tennis. I mean, he was watching tennis before I was born. It\u2019s crazy. His whole life, it\u2019s about tennis.\u201cI think for them, watching his kid making history, lifting the trophy, winning Wimbledon, is something incredible for them. For me to have them there, giving them a big hug, it\u2019s something that I will never forget. I hope to have a photo from that moment because I\u2019m going to keep forever.\u201d (Getty Images)Jamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:541689539627Carlos Alcaraz: \u201cIf I would have lost that set, probably I couldn\u2019t lift the trophy. I probably could have lost in three sets, straight sets.\u201cI would say that gave me a lot of confidence, a lot of motivation to still going and to think that I\u2019m able to win Novak in that stage.\u201cI am totally different player than French Open. I grew up a lot since that moment. I learned a lot from that moment.\u201cI took lesson from that match. I did something different before the match. I prepared a little bit different mentally before the match. I could deal with the pressure, the nerves, better than I did in French Open.\u201cI think was the mental part that allow me to stay there during the five sets.\u201dJamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:331689538534Carlos Alcaraz is here, and is very much still in shock after winning the Wimbledon final: \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true for me, being a Wimbledon champion, something that I really wanted. Honestly, I didn\u2019t expect to get it really soon. Yeah, it\u2019s time to enjoy and share everything, all my feelings.\u201cBeating Novak at his best, in this stage, making history, being the guy to beat him after 10 years unbeaten on that court, is amazing for me.\u201cIt\u2019s something that I will never forget, that\u2019s for sure. As I said, it\u2019s great for the new generation, as well, I think to see me beating him and making them think that they are capable to do it, as well.\u201cIt\u2019s great for me and I think for the young players, as well.\u201d (The Independent)Jamie Braidwood16 July 2023 21:151689537002Novak Djokovic \u2018surprised\u2019 by Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s level at WimbledonA very gracious Novak Djokovic continues to praise Carlos Alcaraz, the new Wimbledon champion: \u201cI must say he surprised me. He surprised everyone how quickly he adapted to grass this year. He hasn\u2019t had too many wins on grass in the last two years that he played. Obviously him coming from clay, having the kind of style that he has.\u201cI think Queen\u2019s helped him a lot. He was close to lose that first match, opening match, in Queen\u2019s. Then he started to gain momentum, more and more wins against really good players.\u201cI must say the slices, the kind of chipping returns, the net play, it\u2019s very impressive. I didn\u2019t expect him to play so well this year on grass, but he\u2019s proven that he\u2019s the best player in the world, no doubt.\u201cHe\u2019s playing some fantastic tennis on different surfaces and he deserves to be where he is.\u201dJamie Braidwood16 July 2023 20:501689536516Novak Djokovic on Carlos Alcaraz: \u2018I haven\u2019t played someone like him, not ever Roger or Rafa\u2019 Novak Djokovic on Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s greatest strengths: \u201cI think people have been talking in the past 12 months or so about his game consisting of certain elements from Roger, Rafa, and myself. I would agree with that. I think he\u2019s got basically best of all three worlds.\u201cHe\u2019s got this mental resilience and really maturity for someone who is 20 years old. It\u2019s quite impressive. He\u2019s got this Spanish bull mentality of competitiveness and fighting spirit and incredible defense that we\u2019ve seen with Rafa over the years.\u201cAnd I think he\u2019s got some nice sliding backhands that he\u2019s got some similarities with my backhands. Yeah, two-handed backhands, defense, being able to adapt. I think that has been my personal strength for many years. He has it, too.\u201cI haven\u2019t played a player like him ever, to be honest. Roger and Rafa have their own obviously strengths and weaknesses. Carlos is very complete player. Amazing adapting capabilities that I think are a key for longevity and for successful career on all surfaces.\u201d (PA Wire)Jamie Braidwood16 July 2023 20:41\n\n\n\nNewer1\u00a0/\u00a06Older\n\n\n\n"}, {"_id": "64b4f29a51ac331ac5b72901", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/news/is-broadway-affected-by-sag-strike-b2375714.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "What the actors\u2019 strike means for Broadway shows", "lead": "<p>Screen Actors Guild announced industrial action to coincide with writers\u2019 strike </p>", "author": "Louis Chilton", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 07:43:46", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:46.498190", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T07:43:46+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2022/04/01/09/GettyImages-539757268.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free IndyArts newsletter for all the latest entertainment news and reviewsSign up to our free IndyArts newsletter\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The union comprises screen actors, as well as broadcast journalists, announcers, presenters, and stunt performers.While the total membership comprises more than 160,000 people, only the 65,000 performers in TV and film productions are currently participating in the strike.This means that Broadway performers are currently working as usual, and the theatre industry will not be affected.RecommendedActors strike \u2013 live: SAG walkout could last at least six monthsNetflix has quietly added one of the best films of 2023Oppenheimer actors walk out of UK premiere as Hollywood stars join writer strikeAt a press conference announcing the strike, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said:\u201cThe eyes of the world and, particularly, the eyes of labour are upon us.

Terrifying. Not least because, AI systems will go into defensive infrastructure ultimately. They\u2019ll be in charge of nuclear weapons. To say that that is a separate entity from the person wielding, programming, putting that AI to use, then we\u2019re doomed. It has to be about accountability. We have to hold people accountable for what they do with the tools that they have.\u201dHe added: \u201cWith the labour disputes going on in Hollywood right now, a lot of it \u2013 when we talk about AI, when we talk about these issues \u2013 they\u2019re all ultimately born from the same thing, which is when you innovate with technology, you have to maintain accountability.\u201dPeony Hirwani17 July 2023 07:001689571816 Director Simone Holland reveals the \u2018hardest part about watching the strike\u2019Director Simone Holland has opened up about the \u201chardest part about watching the strike\u201d.\u201cThe hardest part about watching the strike is seeing all of the black writers and filmmakers that have sacrificed everything, who get lower rates/deals over-all, who\u2019s content is usually the first to go; deal with glass cliff cycles consistently,\u201d she wrote on Twitter on Sunday (16 July).Peony Hirwani17 July 2023 06:301689568216Former Paramount CEO Barry Diller says strikes could lead to Hollywood's 'absolute collapse' if not resolved soonFormer Paramount and 20th Century Fox CEO Barry Diller warned that the industry could face an \u201cabsolute collapse\u201d if the Writers\u2019 and Screen Actors Guild joint strike extends into the fall.\u201cWhat will happen is, if in fact, it doesn\u2019t get settled until Christmas or so, then next year, there\u2019s not going to be many programs for anybody to watch.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSalt, fat, acid, heat. These are, according to American chef Samin Nosrat, the four elements that good cooking revolves around. They could just as easily be the ingredients of great modern television: the cynical tang of salt on the edge of lachrymosity, the insulating human warmth of fat, acid\u2019s harsh repudiation of sentiment, and heat, the lit fire of writing and performances that makes the mouth water. The Bear, Disney+\u2019s much-garlanded series about a Chicago restaurant, has all these constituents \u2013 and, returning for its second series, sizzles in the skillet.The dysfunctional team behind The Original Beef of Chicagoland \u2013 Carmy Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White), cousin Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and sous chef Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) \u2013 are back in business. Their new restaurant, The Bear, is, permits pending, launching in a few months, meaning they\u2019re in a race against time to train their brigade and get the place ready to transition to haute cuisine. \u201cThis is a terrible idea,\u201d comes Sydney\u2019s verdict, when the launch date is circled on a calendar. But with money running tight, options are even scarcer.At the same time, Carmy, Richie, and the Berzatto sister Sugar (Abby Elliott) are still dealing with grief. Mikey, the spendthrift drug addict brother whose suicide precipitated Carmy\u2019s return to Chicago, is a spectre hanging over The Bear \u2013 both the restaurant and the show. Sydney, meanwhile, has given up a promising culinary career to apprentice with Carmy, and is facing the opprobrium of her father (Robert Townsend). The cast, from White\u2019s hangdog virtuoso to Edebiri\u2019s wide-eyed wunderkind and Moss-Bachrach\u2019s unhinged interloper, are uniformly excellent, a well-oiled machine serving different emotional stations.The Bear is frenetic: at times it hisses like sauteed onions, at others it burbles like roiling stock. The controlled pandemonium of a chef\u2019s kitchen \u2013 so viscerally portrayed in the writing of Anthony Bourdain or the reality TV of Gordon Ramsey \u2013 reaches aggressively stressful crescendos. \u201cYes chef!\u201d audiences yell, in unison with the kitchen staff. But The Bear is also slow and talky at times, giving its characters long near-monologues to express their interiority. It is, as poet Matthew Arnold famously wrote, \u201cthe turbid ebb and flow\u2026 of human misery\u201d.The Bear has just been nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 2023 Primetime Emmys (as well as Best Comedy Actor, Supporting Actor and Actress in a Comedy, Best Comedy Writing, etc). This may surprise the show\u2019s viewers, as The Bear is many things before it is funny. Creator Christopher Storer\u2019s script is relentless, nerve-wracking, poignant, and then \u2013 and only then \u2013 funny. Like many of the best shows of the past year \u2013 Succession or The White Lotus, both of which are competing in the Drama category at the Emmys \u2013 The Bear is a merger of genres. \u201cYo,\u201d shouts ne\u2019er-do-well Richie, \u201cyou ever think about purpose?\u201d \u201cI love you,\u201d Carmy replies, \u201cbut I do not have time for this.\u201dRecommendedThen You Run is a lesson in how to do ultraviolence on screenHijack: The nail-biting Idris Elba plane thriller that\u2019s flying under the radarThe Great season three review: History at its most horrible \u2013 and enjoyableWith the unexpected success of the first season, the new episodes expand the canvas. Among the cast joining the second series are Oscar winners Jamie Lee Curtis and Olivia Colman, as well as great small-screen presences, like Sarah Paulson, John Mulaney and Bob Odenkirk. Perhaps as an acknowledgement of its impact on the Chicago scene, chefs, like Dylan Patel, Donnie Madia and David Posey, make cameos representing the city\u2019s foodies. But no development is as narratively important as the introduction of Claire (Molly Gordon), an improbably perfect love interest for Carmy. \u201cYou\u2019re the bear,\u201d she tells him, as they meet-cute at a bodega. \u201cAnd I remember you.\u201dIn transitioning from The Beef to The Bear, the shabby joint goes from dive to fine dining; and this second volume of the show adds the same rich, glossy glaze. At times it lacks the dramatic crackle of the breakout first series, and the absence of an operational kitchen until the finale means much of the culinary tension has to be outsourced. But The Bear is still an intense, pressure-cooked experience. \u201cI am currently opening a restaurant,\u201d Carmy tells his Al-Anon meeting, \u201cthat\u2019s providing zero amusement or enjoyment.\u201d Thankfully, his struggles are more easily, and deliciously, experienced from the comfort of your sofa."}, {"_id": "64b4f29c51ac331ac5b72909", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/michael-cera-barbie-superbad-juno-b2376425.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Michael Cera says he became \u2018paranoid and weird\u2019 after Superbad fame", "lead": "<p>Actor was just 19 when \u2018Superbad\u2019 became a hit </p>", "author": "Louis Chilton", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:53:48", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:48.620541", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T06:53:48+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/17/07/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get our free weekly email for all the latest cinematic news from our film critic Clarisse LoughreyGet our The Life Cinematic email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAll love stories have moments of exquisite lightness. In the first episode of BBC One\u2019s The Sixth Commandment, Peter (Timothy Spall) and Ben (\u00c9anna Hardwicke) climb up to a hilltop. Panting and squinting into the sun, they tell each other they love each other for the first time. Unable to contain his happiness, Peter throws his arms around Ben, who lifts him up off the ground so his feet dangle just above the grass. The two men cling to each other. But this is no ordinary love story \u2013 it\u2019s the tragic, true case of a lonely man who was murdered by the very person he thought he would share the rest of his life with. The Sixth Commandment tells the real story of how the meeting of a cherished teacher, Peter Farquhar, and a charming, erudite young student, Ben Field, set in motion one of the strangest, most chilling criminal cases in recent memory. In the early 2010s, churchwarden Field started a campaign of harassment, disguised as love, against Farquhar, a devout Christian who was four decades his senior. Field tricked Farquhar, who had struggled with his sexuality his whole life, into a relationship, and exploited his craving for companionship, becoming the sole beneficiary of his will. Over the course of several years, he drugged him with hallucinogens and encouraged him to drink alcohol. The combined effect made Farquhar think he was losing his mind. Eventually, Field killed Farquhar in 2015, making it look like the 69-year-old had drunk himself to death, and pocketed his inheritance. He then moved on to his next victim, Farquhar\u2019s elderly neighbour Ann Moore-Martin, a retired headteacher and a committed Catholic, played in the drama by Anne Reid. The pair entered into a sexual relationship and the gaslighting began again, with Field writing biblical messages on Moore-Martin\u2019s mirrors at home, telling her to leave her house to him. Ann eventually died from natural causes in 2017, but not before telling her niece about the commands she believed were coming from God. Thanks to Moore-Martin\u2019s niece alerting the police, Field was found out \u2013 he admitted to defrauding both Farquhar and Moore-Martin, showing no remorse, and was sentenced to a minimum jail term of 36 years for the murder of Farquhar and other offences. \u201cIt is ultimately a story about love,\u201d series writer Sarah Phelps says. \u201cAbout wanting to be loved and the representations of love \u2013 there is this false, fraudulent representation, and then the real, deep, driving love of the families.\u201d When Farquhar met Field, he had been suppressing his sexuality for many years, and had resigned himself to being alone. At one point in the drama, he tells his brother, \u201cYou cannot imagine my life before [meeting Ben] and I need you to imagine it. I need you to imagine my absolute despair. You can stand with [your wife] Sue in the sight of God, marry, have children, and our church smiles on you. Your life is full, but me, I have to be untouched, unloved and live only a fraction of my life. And that is in torment and loneliness and self-loathing and grief. Ben has brought me to life. And I am loved.\u201d RecommendedRebecca Romijn: \u2018I wanted to do my trans character justice \u2013 and make her as hot as possible\u2019Hijack: The nail-biting Idris Elba plane thriller that\u2019s flying under the radarWendell Pierce on politics, The Wire and Jack Ryan: \u2018I have a consultant at the CIA who helps me prepare\u2019Spall says it was this internal battle that Farquhar had been fighting that drew him to the role. \u201cWithin Peter, I saw a real tension between somebody trying to reconcile their desires with their faith,\u201d he says, \u201cand within that attempt at reconciliation, that almost denial of the reality of it, along comes the object of a prayer, so perfectly an answer to a prayer that he cannot believe it. And I think that is the real deep tragedy of it: that this man who had given up hope for love, finds it. And he died sincerely believing it was still there.\u201d In an unusual move for a true-crime drama, the police investigation doesn\u2019t crop up until the third and penultimate episode; the first two focus on Farquhar and Moore-Martin in their final years. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to glamorise Ben,\u201d Phelps says, explaining that she wanted to avoid a \u201ccat-and-mouse\u201d narrative of the police versus the villain. \u201cI really wanted to tell Peter\u2019s and Ann\u2019s stories. I wanted to foreground their lives, not their deaths. Otherwise, it was the tricksy perpetrator and the dogged police, and while the police were phenomenal, I didn\u2019t want to feed Ben Field with that sense that he was the main player. I wanted Peter and Ann to be the main part of the story \u2013 and their families and the people who love them.\u201d From Farquhar\u2019s diaries to Field\u2019s workbooks and reams of police transcripts, the stack of source material that Phelps used while writing the show was almost up to her shoulders. And much of the dialogue in the series is taken verbatim from Farquhar\u2019s notes. \u201cPeter wrote everything down,\u201d says Phelps, \u201cand it meant that unbeknown to him, he was narrating what was being done to him. Peter\u2019s diary formed the absolute core basis of the police investigation and the subsequent prosecution.\u201d As the first episode opens, Field is heard reading a sermon. The words are taken from a real sermon that he gave while on bail at his father\u2019s church, on the commandment \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d (which gives the drama its name). In it, he asked whether the commandment applied if death would bring \u201can end to people\u2019s miserable condition\u201d. He said that \u201clegally enforced norms\u201d were less important than one\u2019s personal convictions. Watch Apple TV+ free for 7 daysNew subscribers only. \u00a36.99/mo. after free trial.

He had a fixation with elderly people, too. Director Saul Dibb calls him a \u201cweird character\u201d who \u201cwas working in care homes and as a funeral director\u201d. Hardwicke and Reid as Field and Moore-Martin in \u2018The Sixth Commandment\u2019 (BBC/Wild Mercury/Amanda Searle)The Sixth Commandment has been made in full cooperation with Farquhar\u2019s and Moore-Martin\u2019s families. \u201cThey were completely behind it,\u201d says Phelps, \u201cand they say that we\u2019ve honoured the people they loved.\u201d Reid met Moore-Martin\u2019s niece, Anne-Marie Baker, when she was preparing for the role, and got her blessing to play her late aunt. \u201cI didn\u2019t want do an impersonation of Ann,\u201d Reid says. \u201cI saw a little film of her, and we weren\u2019t really alike, certainly not physically, but when I read the script, I just believed it. It was so beautifully written.\u201d She says she knows straight away whether she can pull off a role, adding, \u201cI felt that if I\u2019d known Ann, we would have actually got on quite well together. But it\u2019s a terrible responsibility playing somebody whose relatives are still there and still loving them.\u201d Phelps wants the drama to serve as a warning to viewers. \u201cI hope it puts people on guard for that very particular kind of trespass, just to be aware of manipulation and people who transgress boundaries in a very, very subtle way,\u201d she says. Spall, meanwhile, gives a powerful reminder of the wider ramifications of a murder. \u201cWhen somebody is killed, that person is dead,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you also kill a big chunk of the souls of the people who love them.\u201d RecommendedThe best Apple TV+ shows to watch nowAidan Turner on his #MeToo tennis drama, Jilly Cooper, and being a sex symbolThen You Run is a lesson in how to do ultraviolence on screenHe pauses thoughtfully. \u201cAnd the people who love that perpetrator \u2013 it will kill parts of their souls, too.\u201d\u2018The Sixth Commandment\u2019 premieres on BBC One at 9pm on Monday 17 July"}, {"_id": "64b4f29d51ac331ac5b7290b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ed-sheeran-eminem-surprise-guest-detroit-b2376363.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Ed Sheeran fans stunned after Eminem revealed as surprise guest during Detroit show", "lead": "<p>The two performed \u2018Lose Yourself\u2019 and \u2018Stan\u2019 </p>", "author": "Peony Hirwani", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:36:06", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:49.114813", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T06:36:06+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/15/17/Copy%20of%20IndependentPhoto_TEMPLATE.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Roisin O\u2019Connor\u2019s free weekly newsletter Now Hear This for the inside track on all things musicGet our Now Hear This email for free\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The persistent assumption that acting pays is finally beginning to look less viable, writes Claire Allfree Peony Hirwani17 July 2023 07:301689573616Christopher Nolan gives warning about AIAt a special screening of his film Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan compared the rapid development of AI technology (a key issue in the labour dispute) with the events in his movie about creation of the atomic bomb.One of the reasons actors are striking is because of fears around AI replacing them and using their likenesses in perpetuity.\u201cThe rise of companies in the last 15 years bandying words like algorithm \u2013 not knowing what they mean in any kind of meaningful, mathematical sense \u2013 these guys don\u2019t know what an algorithm is,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cPeople in my business talking about it, they just don\u2019t want to take responsibility for whatever that algorithm does.\u201d\u201cApplied to AI, that\u2019s a terrifying possibility. Terrifying. Not least because, AI systems will go into defensive infrastructure ultimately. They\u2019ll be in charge of nuclear weapons. To say that that is a separate entity from the person wielding, programming, putting that AI to use, then we\u2019re doomed. It has to be about accountability. We have to hold people accountable for what they do with the tools that they have.\u201dHe added: \u201cWith the labour disputes going on in Hollywood right now, a lot of it \u2013 when we talk about AI, when we talk about these issues \u2013 they\u2019re all ultimately born from the same thing, which is when you innovate with technology, you have to maintain accountability.\u201dPeony Hirwani17 July 2023 07:001689571816 Director Simone Holland reveals the \u2018hardest part about watching the strike\u2019Director Simone Holland has opened up about the \u201chardest part about watching the strike\u201d.\u201cThe hardest part about watching the strike is seeing all of the black writers and filmmakers that have sacrificed everything, who get lower rates/deals over-all, who\u2019s content is usually the first to go; deal with glass cliff cycles consistently,\u201d she wrote on Twitter on Sunday (16 July).Peony Hirwani17 July 2023 06:301689568216Former Paramount CEO Barry Diller says strikes could lead to Hollywood's 'absolute collapse' if not resolved soonFormer Paramount and 20th Century Fox CEO Barry Diller warned that the industry could face an \u201cabsolute collapse\u201d if the Writers\u2019 and Screen Actors Guild joint strike extends into the fall.\u201cWhat will happen is, if in fact, it doesn\u2019t get settled until Christmas or so, then next year, there\u2019s not going to be many programs for anybody to watch. So, you\u2019re gonna see subscriptions get pulled, which is going to reduce the revenue of all these movie companies, television companies, the result of which is that there will be no programs,\u201d Diller said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on Sunday (16 July). \u201cAnd at just the time, [the] strike is settled that you want to get back up, there won\u2019t be enough money.\u201dDiller said he believes a settlement deadline of 1 September should be agreed upon by everybody to prevent \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the entertainment industry.\u201cI think there should be a settlement deadline because\u2026 this actually will have devastating effects if it is not settled soon,\u201d he said \u201cThis is a huge business, both domestically and for world exporters.\u201dDiller added: \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m crying to the skies but these conditions will potentially produce an absolute collapse of an entire industry.\u201d\nPeony Hirwani17 July 2023 05:301689530763Every project affected by the strikeThe list of TV and movies impacted by the strike, from Gladiator 2 to Yellowjackets, is ever-growing.Read the full story here...Every TV show and movie affected by the Hollywood actors and writers\u2019 strikeProduction across the industry is being impacted by the protestsEllie Harrison16 July 2023 19:061689523538Matilda child star Mara Wilson and John Cusack share horror stories on Hollywood studio greedActors have been sharing stories of low income from hugely successful shows and films...\u201cThanks to streaming, I have never once made enough to qualify for SAG-AFTRA healthcare,\u201d Wilson tweeted.While she acknowledged she hasn\u2019t \u201cacted much as an adult\u201d, the star argued: \u201cBut I WAS a recurring character on one of the most critically acclaimed animated shows of all time, as well playing an actual Disney villain.\u201dJohn Cusack and child star share stories on studio greed amid SAG strikeActors\u2019 union and screenwriters\u2019 union have banded together in the fight for fair wages and higher streaming residuals Ellie Harrison16 July 2023 17:051689519489Dune prequel to continue filming during actors\u2019 strikeThe HBO show, titled Dune: The Sisterhood and starring Olivia Williams and Emily Watson, will resume production in Budapest and continue throughout the strikes.It is under contract with British Equity but there are some from SAG-AFTRA involved.

While it never really comes close to matching Always Sunny\u2019s lightning-in-a-bottle comic brilliance, Mythic Quest shines thanks to Charlotte Nicdao\u2019s turn as the talented but flawed Poppy, whose bristly relationship with the egomaniacal Ian (McElhenney) forms the show\u2019s narrative core.

Elba does some of the finest eye-acting seen on TV: his pupils darting around the cabin, communicating to viewers, if not his fellow passengers, where his interests lie. And there\u2019s something almost erotic about the calm confidence with which he goes toe-to-toe with Neil Maskell\u2019s Stone Island hijacker (Maskell, too, is superb, projecting an eerie competence as an East End villain).

In 2021, she\u2019d had a mild stroke after suffering heart problems in previous years.The London native, born to stage star Judy Campbell and Royal Navy lieutenant commander David Birkin, began her career as an actor, with an early role in 1966 British comedy Kaleidoscope starring Warren Beatty and Susannah York.Birkin achieved notoriety quickly by appearing naked in a threesome sex scene in the controversial 1966 Michelangelo Antonioni film Blow-Up.During those years she was married to the British James Bond composer John Barry.RecommendedIsabelle Huppert on nudity, the Paris protests and her reputation: \u2018I think it\u2019s easy to work with me\u2019Jeanne du Barry reviews: Critics suggest French film is not quite the comeback Johnny Depp was hoping forG\u00e9rard Depardieu accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour by 13 womenWhen she later moved to France at the end of the 1960s, in her twenties, the young star gained international fame for her decade-long on and off-screen relationship with French pop poet Gainsbourg. The pair became Paris\u2019s most iconic couple, known for their bohemian and hedonistic lifestyles.The two met while co-starring in the 1969 French satirical romantic comedy Slogan and went on to release a debut album in the same year.One particular song from that album, \u201cJe t\u2019aime... moi non plus\u201d, became a worldwide success and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, despite being banned from a number of radio stations and the Vatican for its sexually explicit content.The two were together for 12 years but never married, and welcomed a daughter, Charlotte Gainsbourg, who went on to become a successful singer and actor.Speaking to The Observer in 2007 about her first date with Gainsbourg, Birkin said: \u201cSerge sweetly doesn\u2019t know how to dance but we go to Regine\u2019s, then to a Russian club, and Serge pushes 100-franc notes into the musicians\u2019 violins so they will play the \u2018Valse triste\u2019 of Sibelius as we get into a taxi; after that we went to an amazing place where Mexican singers Serge knew were playing with Joe Turner, the great jazz man; from there to Madame Arthur, a transvestite club, where Serge\u2019s father played the piano before the war.

In 2016, she starred in the Oscar-nominated short film La femme et le TGV, as a lonely widow who forms a relationship with a train driver.Throughout her career, Birkin starred in around 70 films and was directed by filmmakers from Jean-Luc Godard to Agn\u00e8s Varda.Birkin at the Cannes Film Festival in 2021  (AFP via Getty Images)Birkin\u2019s legacy includes being the name behind the iconic Hermes Birkin handbag, which was launched in 1983.

The persistent assumption that acting pays is finally beginning to look less viable, writes Claire Allfree Peony Hirwani17 July 2023 07:301689573616Christopher Nolan gives warning about AIAt a special screening of his film Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan compared the rapid development of AI technology (a key issue in the labour dispute) with the events in his movie about creation of the atomic bomb.One of the reasons actors are striking is because of fears around AI replacing them and using their likenesses in perpetuity.\u201cThe rise of companies in the last 15 years bandying words like algorithm \u2013 not knowing what they mean in any kind of meaningful, mathematical sense \u2013 these guys don\u2019t know what an algorithm is,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cPeople in my business talking about it, they just don\u2019t want to take responsibility for whatever that algorithm does.\u201d\u201cApplied to AI, that\u2019s a terrifying possibility. Terrifying. Not least because, AI systems will go into defensive infrastructure ultimately. They\u2019ll be in charge of nuclear weapons. To say that that is a separate entity from the person wielding, programming, putting that AI to use, then we\u2019re doomed. It has to be about accountability. We have to hold people accountable for what they do with the tools that they have.\u201dHe added: \u201cWith the labour disputes going on in Hollywood right now, a lot of it \u2013 when we talk about AI, when we talk about these issues \u2013 they\u2019re all ultimately born from the same thing, which is when you innovate with technology, you have to maintain accountability.\u201dPeony Hirwani17 July 2023 07:001689571816 Director Simone Holland reveals the \u2018hardest part about watching the strike\u2019Director Simone Holland has opened up about the \u201chardest part about watching the strike\u201d.\u201cThe hardest part about watching the strike is seeing all of the black writers and filmmakers that have sacrificed everything, who get lower rates/deals over-all, who\u2019s content is usually the first to go; deal with glass cliff cycles consistently,\u201d she wrote on Twitter on Sunday (16 July).Peony Hirwani17 July 2023 06:301689568216Former Paramount CEO Barry Diller says strikes could lead to Hollywood's 'absolute collapse' if not resolved soonFormer Paramount and 20th Century Fox CEO Barry Diller warned that the industry could face an \u201cabsolute collapse\u201d if the Writers\u2019 and Screen Actors Guild joint strike extends into the fall.\u201cWhat will happen is, if in fact, it doesn\u2019t get settled until Christmas or so, then next year, there\u2019s not going to be many programs for anybody to watch. So, you\u2019re gonna see subscriptions get pulled, which is going to reduce the revenue of all these movie companies, television companies, the result of which is that there will be no programs,\u201d Diller said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on Sunday (16 July). \u201cAnd at just the time, [the] strike is settled that you want to get back up, there won\u2019t be enough money.\u201dDiller said he believes a settlement deadline of 1 September should be agreed upon by everybody to prevent \u201cdevastating\u201d effects on the entertainment industry.\u201cI think there should be a settlement deadline because\u2026 this actually will have devastating effects if it is not settled soon,\u201d he said \u201cThis is a huge business, both domestically and for world exporters.\u201dDiller added: \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m crying to the skies but these conditions will potentially produce an absolute collapse of an entire industry.\u201d\nPeony Hirwani17 July 2023 05:301689530763Every project affected by the strikeThe list of TV and movies impacted by the strike, from Gladiator 2 to Yellowjackets, is ever-growing.Read the full story here...Every TV show and movie affected by the Hollywood actors and writers\u2019 strikeProduction across the industry is being impacted by the protestsEllie Harrison16 July 2023 19:061689523538Matilda child star Mara Wilson and John Cusack share horror stories on Hollywood studio greedActors have been sharing stories of low income from hugely successful shows and films...\u201cThanks to streaming, I have never once made enough to qualify for SAG-AFTRA healthcare,\u201d Wilson tweeted.While she acknowledged she hasn\u2019t \u201cacted much as an adult\u201d, the star argued: \u201cBut I WAS a recurring character on one of the most critically acclaimed animated shows of all time, as well playing an actual Disney villain.\u201dJohn Cusack and child star share stories on studio greed amid SAG strikeActors\u2019 union and screenwriters\u2019 union have banded together in the fight for fair wages and higher streaming residuals Ellie Harrison16 July 2023 17:051689519489Dune prequel to continue filming during actors\u2019 strikeThe HBO show, titled Dune: The Sisterhood and starring Olivia Williams and Emily Watson, will resume production in Budapest and continue throughout the strikes.It is under contract with British Equity but there are some from SAG-AFTRA involved.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThirteen months on from the start of the first national rail strikes since the 1980s, the disputes over pay, jobs and working conditions appear as intractable as ever. July has seen the resumption of industrial action aimed at more than a dozen train operators by both main rail unions.In a separate dispute, staff working for the London Underground will walk out for six days in late July in a row over over pensions, job cuts and what the RMT union calls \u201cattacks on working conditions\u201d.In the national rail disputes, the biggest union, the RMT, and Aslef, representing train drivers, say many of their members have not had a pay rise for four years. They are demanding decent, no-strings increases that take into account the high level of inflation. The unions are prepared to discuss reforms, but these must be negotiated separately with commensurate boosts to pay. Train operators and ministers \u2013 who must sign off any deal \u2013 insist modernisation is essential following the collapse of rail revenue, in particular the loss of much of the \u201cbedrock\u201d of season ticket sales since the Covid pandemic.Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Since June 2022, national rail strikes and other forms of industrial action have scuppered the travel plans of tens of millions of train passengers. Stoppages have been called frequently, causing massive disruption and making advance travel planning difficult.RecommendedBalcony falls: holiday companies are right to have zero tolerance to risky behaviourEurope heatwave: Is it safe to travel to Italy, Spain, Greece and Croatia?Teenager detained at Florida airport and accused of \u2018skiplagging\u2019 travel hackTransport for Wales and ScotRail are not involved and will run normal services, but some of the affected operators usually run trains in Wales and Scotland.These are the key questions and answers.Who is taking industrial action, and when?The train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, is mounting \u201caction short of a strike\u201d in the shape of Monday-to-Saturday overtime bans. It carried out the first six-day walk-out from 3 to 8 July. The second began on Monday 17 July and will continue until 22 July inclusive.Hundreds of trains are likely to be cancelled each day.Later in the month the biggest rail union, the RMT, will call 20,000 of its members out on strike on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July. The first two dates coincide with the Aslef overtime bans. The late July walk-outs are likely to cause widespread cancellations at the start of the main summer school holidays in England. A London Underground strike, also involving members of the RMT, will run from Sunday 23 to Friday 28 July. It is sandwiched between two of the national walk-outs called by the same union.Which train operators are involved the national disputes?The RMT strikes and Aslef overtime ban are aimed at rail firms contracted by the Department for Transport. They include the leading intercity operators:Avanti West CoastCrossCountryEast Midlands RailwayGreat Western RailwayLNERTransPennine ExpressMost London commuter operators will be hit:C2C (not involved in the Aslef action)Greater AngliaGTR (Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern, Thameslink)SoutheasternSouth Western Railway Operators focusing on the Midlands and north of England will be affected:Chiltern RailwaysNorthern TrainsWest Midlands TrainsWhat is happening about the London Underground?The RMT plans a walk-out from Sunday 23 July until Friday 28 July. General secretary Mick Lynch says: \u201cThis week of action will shut down the London Underground and show just how important the work of our members is.\u201dThe union claims 600 jobs are scheduled to be axed, leading to \u201cmore unstaffed stations and a lowering of safety standards\u201d. The union says bosses \u201cplan to make London Underground staff poorer in retirement\u201d.London Overground and the Elizabeth Line are unaffected by the planned industrial action. But routes that offer alternatives to strike-hit routes, such as Stratford, Walthamstow Central and Ealing Broadway to central London, are likely to be especially busy during the walk-outs by RMT members working for train operators and the London Underground,Why were the July dates chosen?Like any unions, the RMT and Aslef are seeking the biggest impact \u2013 ie to cause as much disruption as they can. Aslef\u2019s first overtime ban coincided with the first week of the Wimbledon tennis championships in southwest London.The second Aslef overtime ban will affect passengers hoping to travel to the first four days of the fourth Ashes Test between England and Australia, which begins on Wednesday 19 July at Old Trafford in Manchester. The RMT union\u2019s national walk-outs are targeting what are likely to be three of the busiest days of the month.Many families will be on the move at the start of school holidays on 20 and 22 July; those dates also fall during the Open golf championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club.The 29 July strike will hit journeys to and from holiday resorts as well as cricket fans travelling to London for the fifth Ashes Test at the Oval.The strike days for the London Underground, from 23 to 28 July, are intended to disrupt travel in the capital for as long as possible. In combination, passengers in the capital who depend on both national rail and the Tube will be hit by strikes on nine out of 10 days between 20 and 29 July.Which trains will run during the Aslef and RMT industrial action?Passengers can expect normal service on:Caledonian SleeperGrand Central (except for dozens of cancellations due to fleet issues)Heathrow ExpressHull TrainsLondon OvergroundLumoMerseyrailScotRailTransport for WalesSoutheastern: no impact expected from Aslef strike; RMT strike days will see much reduced services, with links only from London Victoria to Bromley South, London Bridge to Dartford and Sevenoaks and London St Pancras International and reduced service hours.Southern/Great Northern/Thameslink: During the Aslef overtime ban, an emergency timetable with fewer services will run. The Thameslink core between London Bridge and St Pancras will be closed.On Great Northern train will run regularly from London Kings Cross to Cambridge and Kings Lynn. Peterborough and Letchworth get peak hour services only.\u201cServices will be busier than usual, especially in peak hours. It\u2019s likely you will need to queue and you may not be able to board your chosen service. You should allow extra time for your journey.\u201dOn RMT strike days, a reduced service will run between 7am and 7pm.Gatwick Express: Cancelled on 17-22 July and on 29 July.Southwestern: Reduced services during Aslef overtime ban, skeleton network on RMT strike days: London Waterloo to Guildford, Southampton, Ascot and Hampton Court. All other lines closed.Great Western Railway (GWR): Night Riviera sleeper train from London Paddington to Penzance is cancelled from 16 to 21 July, resuming on 23 July.The Aslef overtime ban \u201cis likely to cause some short-notice alterations or cancellations\u201d.On the RMT strike days, \u201cmany parts of the GWR network will have no service at all\u201d.GWR says: \u201cServices will start later, finish much earlier and only operate for a limited period during the day.\u201dBut a bigger network than on previous days will operate, with trains on the following intercity routes to and from London Paddington:Cardiff and SwanseaBath and Bristol Temple MeadsOxfordExeter and PlymouthSwindon and Cheltenham SpaIn addition some regional services will run, including Cardiff to Westbury via Bath and Bristol, and Bristol to Plymouth.Chiltern: Fewer trains and reduced hours during the Aslef overtime ban. On RMT strike days the network will be reduced to a limited service linking London Marylebone with Aylesbury, Banbury and Oxford.Avanti West Coast: The Aslef overtime ban is not expected to have an impact. But on RMT strike days the picture is complicated by large-scale engineering work. The basic pattern to and from London Euston will be one train each hour to/from:ManchesterLiverpool (via Birmingham)Preston, with a limited service onwards to Glasgow.On 29 July there will be more trains with Birmingham and Liverpool each getting a dedicated service.North Wales, Shrewsbury, Blackpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Macclesfield and Edinburgh will have no Avanti West Coast services.\u201cThe days after industrial action are also expected to be affected \u2013 particularly due to the reduced timetable for engineering work, but trains may also start later in the morning than usual following the strike,\u201d Avanti West Coast says.Northern: \u201cDisruption is expected between 17-22 July, particularly Friday 21 July, due to industrial action called by Aslef.\u201cThere will be very limited Northern services on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July.\u201dTransPennine Express: \u201cWe expect some services to start later and finish earlier than usual, and some journeys may be altered late or on the day of travel\u201d \u2013 that is the prediction for the Aslef overtime ban.On RMT strike days (20, 22 and 29 July) a very limited number of trains will run on the Manchester Piccadilly-Leeds-York-Scarborough route; between Preston and Manchester Airport; and between Sheffield and Cleethorpes.East Midlands Railway: A number of train cancellations are predicted during the Aslef overtime ban. On RMT strike days, the operator says: \u201cOnly travel by rail if absolutely necessary and if you do travel, expect severe disruption.\u201d But a significant service will operate hourly on these routes:London St Pancras to/from Nottingham, Sheffield and Corby. Derby and NottinghamDerby and MatlockSheffield and NottinghamLeicester and LincolnMansfield Woodhouse and NottinghamNottingham and Skegness (every two hours)LNER: During Aslef overtime ban, \u201cit is possible there will be short-notice alterations and cancellations\u201d.On RMT strike days, a regular service will run on the London-York-Newcastle-Edinburgh line, with first departures around 7am and final arrivals around 10pm. The London-Leeds will run approximately 7am-6pm.Trains could be unexpectedly full as Grand Central \u2013 uninvolved in the dispute \u2013 has cancelled dozens of trains due to fleet issues.Greater Anglia: \u201cA number of cancellations\u201d during the Aslef overtime ban.\u201cAvoid travelling with Greater Anglia on strike days,\u201d the company says.Will airport trains run?The Gatwick Express between the Sussex airport and London is suspended, but Southern trains are available on the London Victoria-Gatwick linkGatwick, Luton, Birmingham and Manchester airports will have some trains during the RMT walk-outs. Stansted Airport is likely to have trains to and from London Liverpool Street every hour from around 7am until the evening.Heathrow airport is unaffected by the national walk-outs: it is served by the Heathrow Express and Elizabeth Line, as well as the London Underground. But during the RMT Tube strike against Transport for London, the airport\u2019s Tube link on the Piccadilly Line is likely to be suspended \u2013 in common with almost all other Underground servicesWill Eurostar be affected?No, but connections to and from the train operator\u2019s main hub at London St Pancras International will be difficult because union members working for all three domestic train operators at the station (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) serving the station will walk out. On London Underground strike days, 23-28 July, access will also be difficult.Why is Aslef taking industrial action?Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cOnce again we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve the dispute.\u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute. Their goals appear to be to continue industrial strife and to do down our industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the public. We just want to see our members paid fairly during a cost of living crisis when inflation is running at above 10 per cent, and to not see our terms and conditions taken away.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government and the companies to think again and look for a resolution.\u201dWhy is the RMT striking nationally?The RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has described the latest offer from the train operators \u2013 represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) \u2013 as \u201csubstandard\u201d. He said: \u201cThis latest phase of action will show the country just how important railway staff are to the running of the rail industry.\u201dThe government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute.\u201cRMT will continue its industrial campaign until we reach a negotiated settlement on pay, working conditions and job security.The RMT has staged walk-outs on 28 days in the current wave of strikes, with Aslef stopping work on 13 previous occasions.What do the train operators say?A spokesman for the RDG said: \u201cMore strikes are totally unnecessary. After a year of industrial action all the RMT has achieved is losing their members more money than they would have received in the pay offers they refused to put to put out to a vote, despite having agreed the terms with the negotiators the room.\u201cWe have now made three offers that the RMT executive have blocked without a convincing explanation. We remain open to talks and we have said repeatedly that we want to give our people a pay rise.\u201cBut until the union leadership and executive is united in what it wants and engages in good faith with the 30 per cent shortfall in revenue the industry is continuing to grapple with post-Covid, it is difficult to move forward.\u201cSadly our staff, our customers and the communities across the country which rely on a thriving railway are the ones that are suffering as a result.\u201dWhat does the government say?A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: \u201cThe RMT leadership\u2019s decision to call strikes targeting two iconic international sporting events, as children and families begin their summer holidays, will disrupt people\u2019s plans across the country.\u201cAfter a year of industrial action, passengers and rail workers alike are growing tired of union bosses playing politics with their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s high time the union leaders realised that strikes no longer have the impact they once did and are simply driving people away from the railway.\u201dI have a ticket booked for one of the RMT national strike days. What can I do?Passengers with Advance, Anytime or Off-Peak tickets can have their ticket refunded with no fee if the train that the ticket is booked for is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled.Train operators are likely to offer flexibility to travel on a wide range of non-strike days.Passengers with season tickets who do not travel can claim compensation for the strike dates through Delay Repay.RecommendedBalcony falls: holiday companies are right to have zero tolerance to risky behaviourEurope heatwave: Is it safe to travel to Italy, Spain, Greece and Croatia?Teenager detained at Florida airport and accused of \u2018skiplagging\u2019 travel hackWhat are the alternatives?As always, long-distance coach operators \u2013 National Express, Megabus and Flixbus \u2013 will keep running, though seats are becoming scarce and fares are rising."}, {"_id": "64b4f2a351ac331ac5b72922", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/woman-plane-switch-seats-mother-tiktok-b2374359.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "CEO praised for refusing to leave airline seat to let mother sit next to her children", "lead": "<p>Jewellery brand chief executive reveals reason she did not switch seats with mother of two </p>", "author": "Maroosha Muzaffar", "datePublished": "2023-07-17 06:25:59", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:55.216269", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-17T06:25:59+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/04/newFile.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThirteen months on from the start of the first national rail strikes since the 1980s, the disputes over pay, jobs and working conditions appear as intractable as ever. July has seen the resumption of industrial action aimed at more than a dozen train operators by both main rail unions.In a separate dispute, staff working for the London Underground will walk out for six days in late July in a row over over pensions, job cuts and what the RMT union calls \u201cattacks on working conditions\u201d.In the national rail disputes, the biggest union, the RMT, and Aslef, representing train drivers, say many of their members have not had a pay rise for four years. They are demanding decent, no-strings increases that take into account the high level of inflation. The unions are prepared to discuss reforms, but these must be negotiated separately with commensurate boosts to pay. Train operators and ministers \u2013 who must sign off any deal \u2013 insist modernisation is essential following the collapse of rail revenue, in particular the loss of much of the \u201cbedrock\u201d of season ticket sales since the Covid pandemic.Caught in the middle: the long-suffering passenger. Since June 2022, national rail strikes and other forms of industrial action have scuppered the travel plans of tens of millions of train passengers. Stoppages have been called frequently, causing massive disruption and making advance travel planning difficult.RecommendedBalcony falls: holiday companies are right to have zero tolerance to risky behaviourEurope heatwave: Is it safe to travel to Italy, Spain, Greece and Croatia?Teenager detained at Florida airport and accused of \u2018skiplagging\u2019 travel hackTransport for Wales and ScotRail are not involved and will run normal services, but some of the affected operators usually run trains in Wales and Scotland.These are the key questions and answers.Who is taking industrial action, and when?The train drivers\u2019 union, Aslef, is mounting \u201caction short of a strike\u201d in the shape of Monday-to-Saturday overtime bans. It carried out the first six-day walk-out from 3 to 8 July. The second began on Monday 17 July and will continue until 22 July inclusive.Hundreds of trains are likely to be cancelled each day.Later in the month the biggest rail union, the RMT, will call 20,000 of its members out on strike on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July. The first two dates coincide with the Aslef overtime bans. The late July walk-outs are likely to cause widespread cancellations at the start of the main summer school holidays in England. A London Underground strike, also involving members of the RMT, will run from Sunday 23 to Friday 28 July. It is sandwiched between two of the national walk-outs called by the same union.Which train operators are involved the national disputes?The RMT strikes and Aslef overtime ban are aimed at rail firms contracted by the Department for Transport. They include the leading intercity operators:Avanti West CoastCrossCountryEast Midlands RailwayGreat Western RailwayLNERTransPennine ExpressMost London commuter operators will be hit:C2C (not involved in the Aslef action)Greater AngliaGTR (Gatwick Express, Great Northern, Southern, Thameslink)SoutheasternSouth Western Railway Operators focusing on the Midlands and north of England will be affected:Chiltern RailwaysNorthern TrainsWest Midlands TrainsWhat is happening about the London Underground?The RMT plans a walk-out from Sunday 23 July until Friday 28 July. General secretary Mick Lynch says: \u201cThis week of action will shut down the London Underground and show just how important the work of our members is.\u201dThe union claims 600 jobs are scheduled to be axed, leading to \u201cmore unstaffed stations and a lowering of safety standards\u201d. The union says bosses \u201cplan to make London Underground staff poorer in retirement\u201d.London Overground and the Elizabeth Line are unaffected by the planned industrial action. But routes that offer alternatives to strike-hit routes, such as Stratford, Walthamstow Central and Ealing Broadway to central London, are likely to be especially busy during the walk-outs by RMT members working for train operators and the London Underground,Why were the July dates chosen?Like any unions, the RMT and Aslef are seeking the biggest impact \u2013 ie to cause as much disruption as they can. Aslef\u2019s first overtime ban coincided with the first week of the Wimbledon tennis championships in southwest London.The second Aslef overtime ban will affect passengers hoping to travel to the first four days of the fourth Ashes Test between England and Australia, which begins on Wednesday 19 July at Old Trafford in Manchester. The RMT union\u2019s national walk-outs are targeting what are likely to be three of the busiest days of the month.Many families will be on the move at the start of school holidays on 20 and 22 July; those dates also fall during the Open golf championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club.The 29 July strike will hit journeys to and from holiday resorts as well as cricket fans travelling to London for the fifth Ashes Test at the Oval.The strike days for the London Underground, from 23 to 28 July, are intended to disrupt travel in the capital for as long as possible. In combination, passengers in the capital who depend on both national rail and the Tube will be hit by strikes on nine out of 10 days between 20 and 29 July.Which trains will run during the Aslef and RMT industrial action?Passengers can expect normal service on:Caledonian SleeperGrand Central (except for dozens of cancellations due to fleet issues)Heathrow ExpressHull TrainsLondon OvergroundLumoMerseyrailScotRailTransport for WalesSoutheastern: no impact expected from Aslef strike; RMT strike days will see much reduced services, with links only from London Victoria to Bromley South, London Bridge to Dartford and Sevenoaks and London St Pancras International and reduced service hours.Southern/Great Northern/Thameslink: During the Aslef overtime ban, an emergency timetable with fewer services will run. The Thameslink core between London Bridge and St Pancras will be closed.On Great Northern train will run regularly from London Kings Cross to Cambridge and Kings Lynn. Peterborough and Letchworth get peak hour services only.\u201cServices will be busier than usual, especially in peak hours. It\u2019s likely you will need to queue and you may not be able to board your chosen service. You should allow extra time for your journey.\u201dOn RMT strike days, a reduced service will run between 7am and 7pm.Gatwick Express: Cancelled on 17-22 July and on 29 July.Southwestern: Reduced services during Aslef overtime ban, skeleton network on RMT strike days: London Waterloo to Guildford, Southampton, Ascot and Hampton Court. All other lines closed.Great Western Railway (GWR): Night Riviera sleeper train from London Paddington to Penzance is cancelled from 16 to 21 July, resuming on 23 July.The Aslef overtime ban \u201cis likely to cause some short-notice alterations or cancellations\u201d.On the RMT strike days, \u201cmany parts of the GWR network will have no service at all\u201d.GWR says: \u201cServices will start later, finish much earlier and only operate for a limited period during the day.\u201dBut a bigger network than on previous days will operate, with trains on the following intercity routes to and from London Paddington:Cardiff and SwanseaBath and Bristol Temple MeadsOxfordExeter and PlymouthSwindon and Cheltenham SpaIn addition some regional services will run, including Cardiff to Westbury via Bath and Bristol, and Bristol to Plymouth.Chiltern: Fewer trains and reduced hours during the Aslef overtime ban. On RMT strike days the network will be reduced to a limited service linking London Marylebone with Aylesbury, Banbury and Oxford.Avanti West Coast: The Aslef overtime ban is not expected to have an impact. But on RMT strike days the picture is complicated by large-scale engineering work. The basic pattern to and from London Euston will be one train each hour to/from:ManchesterLiverpool (via Birmingham)Preston, with a limited service onwards to Glasgow.On 29 July there will be more trains with Birmingham and Liverpool each getting a dedicated service.North Wales, Shrewsbury, Blackpool, Stoke-on-Trent, Macclesfield and Edinburgh will have no Avanti West Coast services.\u201cThe days after industrial action are also expected to be affected \u2013 particularly due to the reduced timetable for engineering work, but trains may also start later in the morning than usual following the strike,\u201d Avanti West Coast says.Northern: \u201cDisruption is expected between 17-22 July, particularly Friday 21 July, due to industrial action called by Aslef.\u201cThere will be very limited Northern services on Thursday 20, Saturday 22 and Saturday 29 July.\u201dTransPennine Express: \u201cWe expect some services to start later and finish earlier than usual, and some journeys may be altered late or on the day of travel\u201d \u2013 that is the prediction for the Aslef overtime ban.On RMT strike days (20, 22 and 29 July) a very limited number of trains will run on the Manchester Piccadilly-Leeds-York-Scarborough route; between Preston and Manchester Airport; and between Sheffield and Cleethorpes.East Midlands Railway: A number of train cancellations are predicted during the Aslef overtime ban. On RMT strike days, the operator says: \u201cOnly travel by rail if absolutely necessary and if you do travel, expect severe disruption.\u201d But a significant service will operate hourly on these routes:London St Pancras to/from Nottingham, Sheffield and Corby. Derby and NottinghamDerby and MatlockSheffield and NottinghamLeicester and LincolnMansfield Woodhouse and NottinghamNottingham and Skegness (every two hours)LNER: During Aslef overtime ban, \u201cit is possible there will be short-notice alterations and cancellations\u201d.On RMT strike days, a regular service will run on the London-York-Newcastle-Edinburgh line, with first departures around 7am and final arrivals around 10pm. The London-Leeds will run approximately 7am-6pm.Trains could be unexpectedly full as Grand Central \u2013 uninvolved in the dispute \u2013 has cancelled dozens of trains due to fleet issues.Greater Anglia: \u201cA number of cancellations\u201d during the Aslef overtime ban.\u201cAvoid travelling with Greater Anglia on strike days,\u201d the company says.Will airport trains run?The Gatwick Express between the Sussex airport and London is suspended, but Southern trains are available on the London Victoria-Gatwick linkGatwick, Luton, Birmingham and Manchester airports will have some trains during the RMT walk-outs. Stansted Airport is likely to have trains to and from London Liverpool Street every hour from around 7am until the evening.Heathrow airport is unaffected by the national walk-outs: it is served by the Heathrow Express and Elizabeth Line, as well as the London Underground. But during the RMT Tube strike against Transport for London, the airport\u2019s Tube link on the Piccadilly Line is likely to be suspended \u2013 in common with almost all other Underground servicesWill Eurostar be affected?No, but connections to and from the train operator\u2019s main hub at London St Pancras International will be difficult because union members working for all three domestic train operators at the station (East Midlands Railway, Southeastern and Thameslink) serving the station will walk out. On London Underground strike days, 23-28 July, access will also be difficult.Why is Aslef taking industrial action?Mick Whelan, Aslef\u2019s general secretary, said: \u201cOnce again we find ourselves with no alternative but to take this action. We have continually come to the negotiating table in good faith, seeking to resolve the dispute.\u201cSadly, it is clear from the actions of both the train operating companies and the government that they do not want an end to the dispute. Their goals appear to be to continue industrial strife and to do down our industry.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to inconvenience the public. We just want to see our members paid fairly during a cost of living crisis when inflation is running at above 10 per cent, and to not see our terms and conditions taken away.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the government and the companies to think again and look for a resolution.\u201dWhy is the RMT striking nationally?The RMT general secretary Mick Lynch has described the latest offer from the train operators \u2013 represented by the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) \u2013 as \u201csubstandard\u201d. He said: \u201cThis latest phase of action will show the country just how important railway staff are to the running of the rail industry.\u201dThe government continues to shackle the companies and will not allow them to put forward a package that can settle this dispute.\u201cRMT will continue its industrial campaign until we reach a negotiated settlement on pay, working conditions and job security.The RMT has staged walk-outs on 28 days in the current wave of strikes, with Aslef stopping work on 13 previous occasions.What do the train operators say?A spokesman for the RDG said: \u201cMore strikes are totally unnecessary. After a year of industrial action all the RMT has achieved is losing their members more money than they would have received in the pay offers they refused to put to put out to a vote, despite having agreed the terms with the negotiators the room.\u201cWe have now made three offers that the RMT executive have blocked without a convincing explanation. We remain open to talks and we have said repeatedly that we want to give our people a pay rise.\u201cBut until the union leadership and executive is united in what it wants and engages in good faith with the 30 per cent shortfall in revenue the industry is continuing to grapple with post-Covid, it is difficult to move forward.\u201cSadly our staff, our customers and the communities across the country which rely on a thriving railway are the ones that are suffering as a result.\u201dWhat does the government say?A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: \u201cThe RMT leadership\u2019s decision to call strikes targeting two iconic international sporting events, as children and families begin their summer holidays, will disrupt people\u2019s plans across the country.\u201cAfter a year of industrial action, passengers and rail workers alike are growing tired of union bosses playing politics with their lives.\u201cIt\u2019s high time the union leaders realised that strikes no longer have the impact they once did and are simply driving people away from the railway.\u201dI have a ticket booked for one of the RMT national strike days. What can I do?Passengers with Advance, Anytime or Off-Peak tickets can have their ticket refunded with no fee if the train that the ticket is booked for is cancelled, delayed or rescheduled.Train operators are likely to offer flexibility to travel on a wide range of non-strike days.Passengers with season tickets who do not travel can claim compensation for the strike dates through Delay Repay.RecommendedBalcony falls: holiday companies are right to have zero tolerance to risky behaviourEurope heatwave: Is it safe to travel to Italy, Spain, Greece and Croatia?Teenager detained at Florida airport and accused of \u2018skiplagging\u2019 travel hackWhat are the alternatives?As always, long-distance coach operators \u2013 National Express, Megabus and Flixbus \u2013 will keep running, though seats are becoming scarce and fares are rising."}, {"_id": "64b4f2a351ac331ac5b72925", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/europe/norway/best-norway-ski-resorts-b2374512.html", "primaryCategory": "Norway", "subCategories": "test", "title": "8 best Norway ski resorts: Where to go for a skiing holiday", "lead": "<p>These picturesque mountain spots include family-friendly routes and cross-country trails </p>", "author": "Helen Wilson-Beevers", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 16:35:51", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:55.970931", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T16:35:51+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/10/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSimon Calder, also known as The Man Who Pays His Way, has been writing about travel for The Independent since 1994. In his weekly opinion column, he explores a key travel issue \u2013 and what it means for you.With so much happening in the world of travel, you may have missed two tragic tales from the same Spanish island resort in the past three weeks. On 23 June, John McKenna, a 22-year-old from Carlisle, died after falling from a hotel balcony in San Antonio in Ibiza late at night. This week, a 35-year-old British male died in the same resort in similar circumstances.Out of respect for their grieving families and friends, I will not speculate about what may have led to their fatal falls. But they are the latest victims in a sequence of tragedies. During the average summer, 10 young people \u2013 mostly male, mostly British \u2013 fall to their deaths from balconies in Spain and other Mediterranean countries.The phenomenon of \u201cbalconing\u201d even has its own Wikipedia entry. Abta, the travel association says: \u201cMany accidents occur due to holidaymakers taking risks, such as climbing from one balcony to another or jumping into the pool from their balcony, and after drinking alcohol.\u201d Which helps to explain why holiday companies and hoteliers take a hard line at such foolhardy behaviour.A reader, Steve L, contacted me this week because his son has just returned early from a \u201clads\u2019 holiday\u201d in Ibiza.RecommendedEurope heatwave: Is it safe to travel to Italy, Spain, Greece and Croatia?Teenager detained at Florida airport and accused of \u2018skiplagging\u2019 travel hackCEO praised for refusing to leave airline seat to let mother sit next to childrenHe writes: \u201cMy son went to Spain recently with four friends and shared two rooms. The two lads in the other adjoining room found it funny on the first day to make a few trips over the divide in the sixth-floor balconies.\u201dStaff at the hotel saw what was happening and immediately intervened. Steve reports: \u201cThe two lads did a runner from the hotel with their stuff and left the others. The hotel staff went to the room with my son and two friends and asked them to leave.\u201dThe three pointed out they had done nothing wrong and wanted to stay. But the police were called and they were turfed out.\u201cThey were out on the streets at midnight and ended up having to arrange to a flight home next morning,\u201d writes Steve.\u201cThe holiday company said they all had to take responsibility because it was a group booking. They advised them to try to claim on travel insurance. What do you advise?\u201dFirst, I advise ignoring the ludicrous suggestion that travel insurance might pay out.I am sorry to hear that the three lads were tarred with the same brush of irresponsibility. They were innocent of any misdeed and have paid a heavy price. As the Foreign Office says in its advice for Spain: \u201cIn some regions you may be fined or evicted from your hotel if you are found to be behaving irresponsibly around balconies.\u201dSafe as houses: balcony mural in Cannes on the French Riviera (Simon Calder)I do not fault the holiday company for taking a hard line with parties of tourists that include reckless individuals. They are trying to reduce the relentless death toll and deter behaviour that endangers other guests and hotel staff.Jet 2 tells its customers: \u201cYou are responsible for your actions and the effect they may have on others. We take a zero-tolerance stance with regard to any person who threatens the safety, comfort and wellbeing of customers and colleagues.\u201cIf you are disruptive on your holiday we can remove you from your accommodation and you will be responsible for your own return home and for any other members of your group who cannot or will not travel without you. You will not be entitled to a refund in either case and we will not provide compensation or meet any costs or expenses.\u201dRecommendedEurope heatwave: Is it safe to travel to Italy, Spain, Greece and Croatia?Teenager detained at Florida airport and accused of \u2018skiplagging\u2019 travel hackCEO praised for refusing to leave airline seat to let mother sit next to childrenBalconies pose dangers to all kinds of holidaymakers, most of whom do not take silly risks. Abta has a useful page on balcony safety. It ends: \u201cIf you lose your room key, always contact reception, if someone is not on the desk, either call the contact number for the night porter or security, or stay in a friend\u2019s room. No matter what, don\u2019t try and access your room via your balcony.\u201dI know. It shouldn\u2019t need saying. But I have done plenty of stupid things while travelling, particularly when young. I have been lucky enough to live to tell the tale and enjoy more adventures. And I want everyone to come home safe after having the time of their young lives."}, {"_id": "64b4f2a451ac331ac5b72927", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/heatwave-italy-spain-greece-weather-europe-b2375834.html", "primaryCategory": "News &amp; Advice", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Europe heatwave: Is it safe to travel to Italy, Spain, Greece and Croatia?", "lead": "<p>A deadly heatwave is sweeping Europe, with ground temperatures in Spain hitting more than 60C</p>", "author": "Simon Calder", "datePublished": "2023-07-16 10:54:24", "dateScraped": "2023-07-17 09:49:56.476835", "dateUpdated": "2023-07-16T10:54:24+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/07/13/14/newFile-2.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Simon Calder\u2019s free travel email for expert advice and money-saving discountsGet Simon Calder\u2019s Travel email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeTravellers from the UK, US and elsewhere in the world may be looking with concern at planned trips to the Mediterranean.As the busiest summer getaway since 2019 begins, travellers to southern Europe are likely to experience extreme heat. An area of high pressure appears to have settled over the Med with little sign of abating. The deadly \u201cCerberus\u201d heatwave (so named by Italian meteorologists) is gripping southern France, Spain, Italy, Croatia, Greece and Turkey, as well as smaller countries in the Mediterranean region.RecommendedEurope heatwave \u2013 live: Deadly \u2018Cerberus\u2019 weather grips Spain, Italy and Greece as cities placed on red alertLand temperatures in Spain surpass 60C as deadly heatwave sweeps EuropeWhy UK weather is wet and windy as Europe swelters under Cerberus heatwaveWhile the heat in western Europe may ease slightly over the next few days, the eastern Mediterranean is likely to get even hotter.With forecasters predicting the heatwave could last for up to two weeks, concerns are growing about the risks to health. As The Independent reported this week, 61,000 Europeans are believed to have died as a result of the extreme heat last summer.For travellers contemplating their options, these are the key questions and answers.Where are the hottest spots?Temperatures around the Mediterranean are typically 8\u201313C above normal \u2013 which, at this time of year, means temperatures are very high by the standards of the UK.On Wednesday afternoon, the temperature at Malaga on Spain\u2019s Costa del Sol peaked at 43C \u2013 over 110F. The Met Office forecast for southern Spain predicts completely clear skies from Saturday 16 to Wednesday 26 July inclusive.Nine Italian cities, including Florence, Bologna and Rome, are on red alert because of the extreme weather. One forecast for the islands of Sicily and Sardinia put the possible temperature as high as 48C (118F).The Cyprus Department of Meteorology says: \u201cThe maximum temperature is expected to reach around 40 degrees Celsius over inland areas and around 32 degrees Celsius over the highest mountainous areas.\u201cDuring Friday and Saturday the temperature is expected to increase further.\u201dAway from the Mediterranean, the landlocked countries of Hungary and Serbia have issued severe heat warnings.What are the health risks \u2013 and how can they be reduced?Young and old traveller, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (especially cardiovascular and respiratory) are particularly susceptible to excess heat.The NHS Scotland Fit For Travel website warns: \u201cExposure to high temperatures can result in loss of fluids and salts.\u201cWhen the body gets overheated, blood is directed away from the centre of the body by relaxation of the blood vessels, this causes sweating and cooling.\u201cRapid dehydration may occur in hot dry conditions. Humidity can reduce the rate of sweat evaporation making it difficult to regulate the body\u2019s temperature.\u201dMore serious disorders include:heat exhaustionheat strokelow sodium in the blood (hyponatremia) as a result of over exertion or exercise.\u201cHeat exhaustion and heatstroke are related conditions that can have a serious outcome if not treated promptly. Symptoms of heat exhaustion include a body temperature above 38C, fast breathing and pulse, dizziness, headache and confusion.\u201cSudden fainting in the heat may occur when travellers are not acclimatised. Fainting occurs when the blood vessels relax to increase the circulation and radiate heat from the skin. This also has the effect of lowering the blood pressure and reducing the blood supply to the brain. Consciousness should quickly return once the person is lying flat.\u201dHow can I reduce the risks?Obvious steps include avoiding being outside during the hottest part of the day (typically 11am-3pm); wearing light, loose clothing and a hat; and drinking plenty of water (possibly with hydration salts). Dark urine is a certain indication you need to up you fluid intake.The NHS say: \u201cLimit physical exertion until you have become acclimatised, most travellers will adapt to higher temperatures in approximately 10 days\u201cClothing should be light and airy \u2013 avoid wearing dark or tight-fitted clothing.\u201cA hand-held personal fan may prove invaluable when it is not possible to escape heat.\u201dAge UK offers advice specifically for older people, which includes the possibly disappointing recommendation: \u201cAvoid alcohol, and keep eating even if you\u2019re not feeling too hungry.\u201dIf someone in my party is in a risk group, can I cancel the trip and get a full refund? Unlikely. If you have booked a package holiday it is always worth talking to the tour operator in case they can offer any flexibility, but there is no legal obligation for them to allow you to switch.Under the Package Travel Regulations, you can transfer a proper package holiday to someone else for a nominal fee of perhaps \u00a350 per person.If you have a travel insurance policy in which you have declared a pre-existing medical condition, you may have grounds for a claim.Will the extreme heat affect transport?Quite possibly. In the UK last July, when the country experienced the hottest spell on record, rail services were drastically reduced and many cancellations made \u2013 because of concern about the steel rails buckling.While Mediterranean nations are prepared for significantly higher temperatures, if unprecedented heat is experienced some departures could be interrupted.Transport providers may also cancel some services to protect their staff.What about aviation?Planes are perfectly able to take off in all but the highest temperatures \u2013 as they do routinely from airports in the Gulf and the southwestern US. But high air temperatures require a higher take-off speed, which can impact the maximum weight at which an aircraft can be dispatched.Extreme heat may also increase the risk of thunderstorms in the Mediterranean region, which will certainly impact aviation as pilots avoid them.Scientists say that as the earth warms, the frequency of clear-air turbulence \u2013 in which aircraft are bumped about, sometimes to the point of causing injuries \u2013 is set to increase.Can you recommend an easy, cool escape?RecommendedTeenager detained at Florida airport and accused of \u2018skiplagging\u2019 travel hackCEO praised for refusing to leave airline seat to let mother sit next to childrenViewers defend airline employee who charged passenger $200 for overweight bag At least until Wednesday 19 July, north winds will keep Iceland at below 15C.

Consciousness should quickly return once the person is lying flat.\u201dHow can I reduce the risks?Obvious steps include avoiding being outside during the hottest part of the day (typically 11am-3pm); wearing light, loose clothing and a hat; and drinking plenty of water (possibly with hydration salts). Dark urine is a certain indication you need to up you fluid intake.The NHS say: \u201cLimit physical exertion until you have become acclimatised, most travellers will adapt to higher temperatures in approximately 10 days\u201cClothing should be light and airy \u2013 avoid wearing dark or tight-fitted clothing.\u201cA hand-held personal fan may prove invaluable when it is not possible to escape heat.\u201dAge UK offers advice specifically for older people, which includes the possibly disappointing recommendation: \u201cAvoid alcohol, and keep eating even if you\u2019re not feeling too hungry.\u201dIf someone in my party is in a risk group, can I cancel the trip and get a full refund? Unlikely. If you have booked a package holiday it is always worth talking to the tour operator in case they can offer any flexibility, but there is no legal obligation for them to allow you to switch.Under the Package Travel Regulations, you can transfer a proper package holiday to someone else for a nominal fee of perhaps \u00a350 per person.If you have a travel insurance policy in which you have declared a pre-existing medical condition, you may have grounds for a claim.Will the extreme heat affect transport?Quite possibly. In the UK last July, when the country experienced the hottest spell on record, rail services were drastically reduced and many cancellations made \u2013 because of concern about the steel rails buckling.While Mediterranean nations are prepared for significantly higher temperatures, if unprecedented heat is experienced some departures could be interrupted.Transport providers may also cancel some services to protect their staff.What about aviation?Planes are perfectly able to take off in all but the highest temperatures \u2013 as they do routinely from airports in the Gulf and the southwestern US. But high air temperatures require a higher take-off speed, which can impact the maximum weight at which an aircraft can be dispatched.Extreme heat may also increase the risk of thunderstorms in the Mediterranean region, which will certainly impact aviation as pilots avoid them.Scientists say that as the earth warms, the frequency of clear-air turbulence \u2013 in which aircraft are bumped about, sometimes to the point of causing injuries \u2013 is set to increase.Can you recommend an easy, cool escape?RecommendedTeenager detained at Florida airport and accused of \u2018skiplagging\u2019 travel hackCEO praised for refusing to leave airline seat to let mother sit next to childrenViewers defend airline employee who charged passenger $200 for overweight bag At least until Wednesday 19 July, north winds will keep Iceland at below 15C.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHave you ever noticed an exotic-looking bird in your garden and wondered what it was?For those looking to attract unusual birds to their gardens, there\u2019s a variety of plants readily accessible in the UK which even the rarest of Britain\u2019s birdlife can\u2019t resist.So say Natalie and John White, nature lovers and co-founders of Birda, a free birdwatching app for curious people who want to deepen their connection with the outdoors, which features a species and location guide, and invites people to log the birds they see and share their love of wildlife.Of course, the proximity of your garden to woodlands, water sources and its size will all have an effect on the species you see frequent your grounds, they say, but it is possible to tailor the birds that visit with the plants that thrive right here in the UK.Here are some you may spot in your garden and in parks, woodlands, conservation areas and while exploring the great outdoors.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live1. GoldfinchPopulations of goldfinches have been rising steadily in the UK in recent decades, as birds have taken advantage of bird food provided in gardens, according to the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO).To attract goldfinches to your plot, consider planting trees and shrubs that produce smaller berries, such as dog rose and coneflower, Natalie and John suggest. These berries are easier for the smaller species like finches and tits to consume.2. HoopoePartial to insects and spiders, this exotic-looking bird has, most notably, a long pinkish-brown crest which it raises when excited, as well as striking black and white wings and a long black downcurved bill. It doesn\u2019t breed in the UK, yet some have been seen mainly on the south coast of England as they migrate north to Europe from Africa, and have even been spotted as far north as Shetland, according to the RSPB.3. Roseate ternThis elegant seabird is known for its pale pinkish hue and long tail streamers. It nests on coastal sites and can be spotted in a few locations around the UK during the summer months. These birds are attracted by sea holly \u2013 the spiky, blue or purple flowers can provide nectar for insects, which in turn attract the terns, Natalie and John observe. Alternatively, sea lavender produces clusters of small, lavender-coloured flowers that can attract insects and provide a food source for the birds.4. Red-footed falconThis small falcon species is a rare visitor to the UK, primarily during the summer. It has a distinctive reddish-brown plumage and can sometimes be spotted in grasslands or wetlands.To attract them, try planting meadowsweet, a perennial plant with white or pink flowers that can attract insects, which are prey for the falcons. Marsh thistle also produces spiky flowers that can attract insects and provide a food source for the birds, Natalie and John suggest.5. BullfinchIf you\u2019re hoping to attract bullfinches to your garden, there are specific plants you can incorporate to make your space more enticing to these beautiful birds.Bullfinches are known for their striking colours, with males displaying vibrant pinkish-red breasts. One of the best plants to attract bullfinches is the crab apple, which produces small, colourful fruits that bullfinches find irresistible. The tree blossoms in spring also provide nectar for insects, which can attract bullfinches seeking a source of protein.Additionally, planting berries and fruits such as hawthorn and blackthorn can help draw these birds to your garden, as the berries provide an essential food source for bullfinches, particularly during the winter months when other food options may be scarce, say Natalie and John.Creating a diverse and layered garden with a mix of trees, shrubs and flowering plants will not only attract rare birds, but also provide them with a range of habitats and food sources throughout the year, the couple maintain.RecommendedWhy this group of mums set up an initiative to help women get back to workPrince George and Princess Charlotte meet boy who tossed coin for Wimbledon finalWhat you need to know about lash growth serumsRemember to also provide a water source and create a safe and peaceful environment, minimising disturbances to make your garden a welcoming haven for all bird species.Any flowering trees or shrubs will attract insects, increasing the chance of bringing birds to your garden.

Whether that is one of having to deprioritise her career because the hours don\u2019t fit around childcare, or of overcoming struggles of navigating a young family and need to often be available 24/7, justifying the steep cost of childcare versus her salary or worst still, returning to work after a baby only to be overlooked for progression, misunderstood or deemed unreliable.\u201dMaynard-James added: \u201cPR Mums gives me the chance to work alongside some incredible women and become an activist of change and represent parents in our industry to demand more.\u201dMore than 75 PR agencies have signed up to support the initiative and advertise vacancies.\u201cOur goal is to add to the industry excellent candidates who feel they otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to stay in the profession after having a child, and to support companies in helping them to stay in the industry,\u201d said Alexandra Heybourne, founding mum and director at Freud Communications.The company also wants to highlight what mums can bring to the table.\u201cIn my experience, new parents are highly focused, more empathetic and seem to have an inner strength they didn\u2019t have before,\u201d said founding mum Nicola McKelvey, a self-employed senior communications consultant.By helping mothers get back into work, the firm hopes to see more women rise to senior roles.\u201cIn PR especially, it\u2019s a real issue that so many women drop out of the industry after they have a child, leaving agencies male-heavy in senior positions,\u201d McKelvey continued.\u201cThis affects the whole PR eco-system, impacting culture, values and behaviours of each organisation. PR Mums aims to address this and ensure women are properly represented throughout the PR industry.\u201dThe company\u2019s pre-launch announcement generated a flood of support and positive responses on social media from industry insiders who believe an initiative like this is long overdue.\u201cThat we went viral is testimony to the strength of the people involved and more importantly the absolute need for PR Mums from all sides of the sector,\u201d said Heybourne.RecommendedPrince George and Princess Charlotte meet boy who tossed coin for Wimbledon finalWhat you need to know about lash growth serumsSex Education star Patricia Allison: I\u2019ve learned boundaries are extremely important\u201cWe\u2019ve been flooded with stories, opportunities and solidarity \u2013 what\u2019s heartening is that everyone wants to support mums and more broadly parents in the industry.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDefining Dishes is a new IndyEats column that explores the significance of food at key moments in our lives. From recipes that have been passed down for generations, to flavours that hold a special place in our hearts, food shapes every part of our lives in ways we might not have ever imagined.I got my first job in Hanoi as an EFL (English as a Foreign Language) teacher and taught a kindergarten class at the weekends. The school had a mix of Vietnamese and other EFL teachers, so I was able to make a lot of really great friends who were very keen to educate all of us foreigners on the best local food. On my first day at the school, they took me to a bun cha stall nearby that was really, really popular and it was always full. They served it with strips of pork belly, which is uncommon. Quite often, you\u2019d have to wait a little while to get a seat, but it was always worth it. Once, I saw a bride and groom dining there in their wedding outfits!My favourite thing about bun cha is the smell of smoky meat coming off the open-air grill. It would fill the air around you while you sat and waited for your food to arrive. That delicious smell is what I miss the most when I try to make it for myself in the UK but it\u2019s really hard to recreate indoors. The way my Vietnamese friends taught me to eat it was to pour the nuoc cham \u2013 a sauce made from fish sauce, sugar, lime juice and water \u2013 all over the dish and mix it all up, but I know other people just dip the meat in it. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no one correct or incorrect way to do it, but the sauce is so delicious, why wouldn\u2019t you want to soak the whole thing in it?I spent one year in Hanoi and moved back to my parent\u2019s house in York, where I grew up, in 2011. By this time, I\u2019d done a few embarrassing TV adverts and little acting jobs in Hanoi, and I went on to do quite a lot of presenting work on little local channels and corporate videos. Then I came across a Sainsbury\u2019s magazine, I think, that was running a competition by the British Herb Association, which I\u2019d never heard of before.They were looking for people to cook a recipe using British-grown herbs. I decided to try making a bun cha at home by adapting a recipe by New Zealand-born US chef Bobby Chin. I\u2019m sure I butchered it and Anglicised it (all those terrible things) because I\u2019d never made it before. But I did use some fresh British herbs, coriander and mint that my parents grew in their garden, which was quite sweet. I filmed myself making it and submitted it for the competition, and in the end, I was invited to take part in the final.RecommendedIt\u2019s easier to make baklava at home than you might thinkGet set for Wimbledon with top pastry chef\u2019s strawberry recipesPinch of Nom: Healthy eating doesn\u2019t have to cost the earthI\u2019d really like to highlight that I am not a chef. I like my food and I enjoy cooking, but I\u2019ve never pretended to be a chef. Anyway, I went to London and participated in the cook-off against two other ladies and was judged by Masterchef\u2019s John Torode. Of course I\u2019d seen him on TV quite a lot \u2013 he was fairly intimidating, to be honest. He was very friendly off-camera, but he plays a part when they\u2019re rolling. I remember he came up to me and said: \u201cOh, you obviously much prefer cooking in your own home than in a professional kitchen.\u201d I said: \u201cWell, yes, I\u2019m not a professional.\u201dHe was very complimentary about my dish, although he did highlight that there was a lack of smokiness in the meat, which was a very fair point. But I won the competition somehow and that\u2019s how it linked me to getting my first proper TV presenting gig. I saw an advert for a TV channel in Mumbai that was searching for a presenter who could also cook, so I sent off my details and a video of me making bun cha in the competition.A couple of days later, they got in touch with me and seemed quite pleased by my enthusiasm. I was flown out to Delhi just two weeks later. It seemed too good to be true, but I started presenting on a show called Quest, which was initially only broadcast in Mumbai on Travelxp. It\u2019s now an international channel that broadcasts in about 30 countries. The show had me visiting chefs and families around India and learning about \u201cforgotten dishes\u201d that people were rediscovering and cooking.It was an incredible opportunity and I feel very fortunate to be able to do what I do. Maybe I should be thanking Sainsbury\u2019s magazine. But it\u2019s bun cha and Hanoi that I have the most love for. When I make it now, I have this image in my mind of the place that I would go with my teacher friends and I\u2019m doing my very best to emulate that flavour. I\u2019m sure if I went back now and tried the authentic version again, I\u2019d think: \u201cGod, I\u2019m just butchering it.\u201d But you know, I\u2019m doing my best.Alex Outhwaite is a travel TV presenter.

According to the European Commission, \u201call national dietary guidelines among European countries include recommendations on adequate intake of water and fluids; most specify 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day\u201d.The amount of water that Americans drink is a bit higher, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that from 2015 to 2018, adults drank an average of 44 ounces of water, which is equivalent to 1.3 litres, a day. The recommended daily water intake is also higher in America than Europe, as the Mayo Clinic notes that men in the US should be drinking about 3.7 litres of water a day, while women should be drinking about 2.7 litres.RecommendedHow to be waterwise in your garden this summerFrom Brad Pitt to Ariana Grande: All the celebrities spotted at the Wimbledon finalCharlotte and George\u2019s priceless reaction to Alcaraz win at Wimbledon finalAs noted byCond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, there are some water drinking habits in Europe that are uncommon in America.
