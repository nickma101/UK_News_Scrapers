It may have influenced Southgate’s thinking: even as he may be, with no exaggeration, City’s ninth-choice central midfielder now, he seemed capable of resurrecting his England form. His nickname – ‘the Yorkshire Pirlo’ – was never entirely serious, but never appeared so utterly inappropriate. Southgate took him off before he could be sent off, bringing on Jordan Henderson, to some boos but mostly audible cheers."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It was a substitution to highlight twin problems ahead of Euro 2024. Southgate has to spend more of his time defending his defensive midfielders. There are reasons to exclude each of Henderson and Phillips; the reasons to include them may be a lack of alternatives the manager values as highly. But if Phillips could have exited Wembley amid the ignominy of a red card, for Bellingham, a substitution came to a standing ovation.

The alienation of the people who inhabit her stories is mirrored by the namelessness of many of the protagonists, who are referred to by an initial, a status or a relationship. But despite this and the elliptical nature of the writing, the stories are full of feeling and the desire for connection. Loving and longing are never far away, nor are hopes and thwarted desires. Full of humanity and its joys and disappointments, tiny incidents resonate through time and relationships. The city feels like another character, slipping in and out of focus just as the fleeting lives of the characters do too.8/10(Review by Bridie Pritchard)"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "2.

As Q ponders the meaning of life and reconnects with his pale, withering body, he meets a cast of oddball characters, including the young, beautiful and mysterious Eva. Captain Corelli’s Mandolin author Louis de Bernières has an undeniable talent for creating an achingly romantic affair from what may at first glance appear to be a mundane midlife crisis. However, his remorseless fun-poking at modern society may be a little more divisive and elicit a range of responses, from hearty chuckles and a wry smile to the odd sore arm.7/10(Review by Emily Pennink)"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "3.

It’s hard to know who it’s aimed at – it’s not typical toddler fare with its deeper themes, especially with the very adult personal statement at the end about why he created it. But it is still written and illustrated in his signature style. He wants it to inspire people to act differently, to make better stories.

The Skinner character is at a professional crossroads: to keep plugging away or to risk it all for ill-gotten riches.

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "“She has so much great PR, and has so many great stories out there about her. People love her so much that I think a story about her private jet is so minimal. That wasn’t like a national tragedy,” he said. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Swift isn’t necessarily that different from other celebrities who have their own private jets. In fact, Yard also found that in 2022, Floyd Mayweather omitted 7,076.8 tonnes of CO2 from his private jet. Jay-Z’s jet trailed behind him by omitting 6,981.3 tonnes of CO2. Other stars on the list of avid private jet users also include Alex Rodriguez, Blake Shelton, Steven Spielberg, and Oprah Winfrey."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Williams claimed that some fans may not have been surprised by Swift’s private jet usage in 2022. “Let’s face it, in terms of the music business, this has been going on forever,” he said. “From Led Zeppelin to today’s rock stars, people have used private jets. They almost have to for the type of work that they do, as they travel from one city to another.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "He also defended Swift’s PR team against the conspiracy theory, noting that it would be a waste of time to use SEO practices - which utilises key words and phrases to improve website traffic - to push stories about her private jet down on Google search. Instead, he believed that if Swift’s goal was to prevent certain stories from gaining traction online, then she would be talking about more significant moments in her life. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "For example, Swift’s fans managed to completely take over Ticketmaster in November 2022, when the website shut down entirely due to the overwhelming number of people buying tickets for her US Eras Tour. “Taylor’s PR would be much smarter by going out and talking about how many shows that she’s selling out and how quickly they’re selling out. Or, she’d be much wiser to go out and talk about the latest song that she’s dropping. Those things would be receiving much more press than going to a Jets football game,” he added. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "“Whether it’s something involving a charitable organisation, a new collaboration with an artist, or even overcoming something in their own personal life, those types of stories will resonate more with the public or with the media than trying to manipulate it with some scheme or idea to push Google searches,” the PR manager continued."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Speaking to Informfully, Molly McPherson – a PR expert in Massachusetts who specialises in crisis communication strategy – agreed with Williams, noting that it doesn’t seem likely that Swift used the Jets game for SEO purposes. While she acknowledged that fans will never know whether the football game and private jet usage have any connection to each other, the conspiracy theory speaks volumes about the “Anti-Hero” singer’s role in the media."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It goes without saying that Swift is constantly making waves online, especially given her devoted fan base, which is something that McPherson believes the Grammy winner is aware of. “You know, we’ll never know if she did this intentionally or not,” McPherson said about Swift’s appearance at the Jets game. “She packed that private suite with friends and colleagues and well-known people that she knew would draw attention. That without a doubt was intentional. For example, Sophie [Turner] attended the game after Taylor helped her release an official response to her divorce from Joe Jonas, which was simply the two women walking out of dinner together. And it became highly publicised content.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "McPherson also acknowledged that while the technological side behind the process of SEO isn’t easy to understand, it could still be possible to create new content that diminishes what pops up on Google when you search “Taylor Swift’s jets”. Although Swift’s private jet usage has been brought back to light, fans aren’t necessarily discussing the controversy surrounding her carbon emissions. According to McPherson, there could be a strategic reason why her private jet usage has been publicised again."}, {"type": "text", "text": "”Instead of everyone talking about the jet emission story, they’re talking about the SEO about the jet emission story. She’s created a media moment where no one is asking her about jet emission stories. They’re just talking about the story. So, that could actually be a counter offense to the PR mechanism that paid off,” she claimed."}, {"type": "text", "text": "McPherson went on to agree with Williams that Swift has been publicised in a positive light, despite the backlash she faced for her private jet usage last year. Not to mention Swift has made major career moves throughout the last year, specifically due to her Eras Tour, which is why her jet emissions didn’t necessarily affect her fan base."}, {"type": "text", "text": "“Her decision to not address the jet emission story could have been a calculated move, in order to bury the story with these bigger moves that were coming,” she said. “For example, the Eras Tour announcement, the ticket relationship, and the concert itself. This could have all perhaps led to a future relationship with an NFL player.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Ultimately, it appears the SEO conspiracy theory surrounding Swift’s attendance at the Jets game and her private jet usage is indeed just a theory. As dedicated Swifties know, the “All Too Well” singer is notoriously private about her personal life, which has prompted fans to come up with even more theories about her. Despite the fact that Swift usually chooses not to respond to these theories - whether they’re about her love life or her career - McPherson believes that the singer is well aware of these rumours. Given her reputation, Swift knows that theories about her aren’t stopping anytime soon."}, {"type": "text", "text": "“The rumour mill surrounding Taylor Swift is always in overdrive but until we hear from Taylor Swift herself, all the public has is theory,” she explained. “In the world of celebrities, theories are the currency. They create questions, and questions come from conversations, and conversations have two sides. When you have two sides, you’re gonna have multiple people chiming in on those sides. Another master stroke from Taylor Swift: she is creating content to ask questions without ever providing the answer. The answer stops the conversation. So, just keep the rumour mill going.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "However, Williams acknowledged that despite the ongoing speculation that exists about Swift, fans shouldn’t become too reliant on it. In a majority of cases, these fan theories don’t speak the truth like the singer herself does."}, {"type": "text", "text": "“I think the reason Taylor has a great image is because it’s based on reality. That’s the best thing you can do,” he said. “The problem is that publicists sometimes try to change people, and you can’t do that. It never works out in the end, when you try to create something that isn’t reality, it will eventually be sussed out. It may take a while for people and the press to catch on, but at some time, they will. You’re best to take just the realities of that person and present those, that’s what you need to do.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Informfully
