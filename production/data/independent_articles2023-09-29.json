It took me straight back to Helen Marten and Michael Dean\u2019s immersive 3D assemblages in the 2016 Turner Prize.

That aspiration seemed to be quickly lost sight of as the \u201cold normal\u201d returned. Yet I swear I saw it in operation at the Turner show in Eastbourne. There will be a glossy awards ceremony in December under the full glare of the British media. Jesse Darling will probably win and certainly deserves to.

(His songs \u201cPerfect\u201d and \u201cThinking Out Loud\u201d remained the UK\u2019s most popular choice of nuptial first dances as of 2022.) The skip-along, hammer-on tune of \u201cSpring\u201d recalls the Postal Service\u2019s hit \u201cSuch Great Heights\u201d, as Sheeran captures a life watching recommended TV shows that \u201cdon\u2019t get good until the end\u201d and failed attempts at sober months \u2013 all the while, he clings to the hope of warmer feelings on the horizon. There\u2019s a perky bounce to the programmed drum of \u201cMidnight\u201d, which also sees the singer reminding himself that \u201ceven the worst days of my life will always end at midnight in your arms\u201d."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Elgar once said: \u201cAn Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white \u2013 all over white \u2013 and somebody will say what exquisite taste.

English music is white and evades everything.\u201d Sometimes Sheeran\u2019s tidy tunes and high street platitudes do feel like white paint. \u201cLa-la-laaa-layyy\u201d he noodles on \u201cThe Day I Was Born\u201d. Other times, his relatable warmth and sincerity snag you by the sleeve like a plastic bag.
