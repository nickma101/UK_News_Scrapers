Some of them didn't perform well at all.

You have an innovative, novel design, but it comes with a lot of mysteries in terms of how it is going to perform over time.\"Mr Gates said the fact that Titan apparently has not surfaced despite being \"well off the bottom\" when contact was lost at the weekend opens up questions over what else may have gone wrong.One such possibility is a hull failure, which \"speaks to the carbon fibre design of Titan\", Mr Gates said. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that though the time period for a rescue is closing, \"we should remain hopeful here for a positive outcome for this\".Mr Gates also touched on some online criticism of the passengers for boarding the experimental craft at a high cost, saying there have been \"a lot of callous comments\".He said Titanic has \"fascinated the world\" since she sank a century ago and the shipwreck holds \"a real fascination for people\".\"It takes a lot of courage and determination to go on a voyage like this,\" he said, adding that he \"commended\" the five men aboard Titan for having the \"passion and determination\" to embark on the deep-sea trek.\n"}, {"_id": "64940b5451ac334d990dccbe", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/restaurant-explosion-kills-31-people-in-north-west-china-12907355", "primaryCategory": "home", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Restaurant explosion kills 31 people in northwest China", "lead": "A massive cooking gas explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwestern China has killed 31 people and injured seven.", "author": "\nReemul Balla\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 08:07:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:50:28.135945", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-china-explosion-restaurant_6195442.jpg?20230622080631", "body": "\nA massive cooking gas explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwestern China has killed 31 people and injured seven.The blast happened at around 8.40pm local time on Wednesday in Yinchan, the capital of the traditionally Muslim Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, as people were gathering on the eve of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday.\n\n\n\nA woman cited by Chinese publication, The Paper, said she had been some 50m (164ft) from the restaurant when she heard the bang.She said thick smoke streamed from the restaurant and a strong smell of cooking gas was in the air.Two waiters came out of the building after the explosion, with one collapsing immediately, she added\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more:China lashes out at Biden over his 'absurd and irresponsible' description of Xi JinpingChina drilling hole over 11,000m deep into the desertChinese President Xi Jinping demanded urgent medical care for those hurt and a safety overhaul.Several people were receiving treatment for burns and cuts from shattered glass. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Central Government's Ministry of Emergency Management said on social media that search and rescue work at the restaurant was completed early on Thursday morning. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigators had also been sent to explore the cause of the blast.\n"}, {"_id": "64940b5451ac334d990dccbf", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/search-for-firefighter-iain-hughes-missing-in-english-channel-during-charity-swim-called-off-12907334", "primaryCategory": "home", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Search called off for firefighter missing in English Channel during charity swim", "lead": "The search for a missing firefighter who was swimming the English Channel for charity has been called off.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 08:08:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:50:28.366632", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-iain-hughes-firefighter_6195361.jpg?20230621232829", "body": "\nThe search for a missing firefighter who was swimming the English Channel for charity has been called off.

I just assume they will fit and if they don't, well, I can break them in - cue hobbling around with painful blisters for several weeks.But that could all soon be a distant, painful memory. Asher Clark, scion of the Clarks shoe dynasty, has a grand plan for the \"future of footwear\" and in order to investigate it, I had to get my feet physically measured.Forget the tape measure and those weird shoe shop devices, Clark instead had me step on what looked like a set of futuristic scales in the back of his Vivobarefoot store in central London, equipped with a monitor that displayed the soles of my feet in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom where I was placing all my weight (too much on the heels, not enough on the toes), to measurements for everything from \"instep girth\" to \"arch height\", it was a far cry from \"looks like a seven-and-a-half to me\".\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nI put too much weight on my heels, it seems\n        \n\n\n\nNot long after, this scales-like machine had transformed a scan of my feet into a 3D model and sent it to my phone, ready to form the basis of a bespoke pair of shoes.This, says Clark, is how we'll all want to get our new trainers one day.\"Ten thousand years ago, humans made shoes out of local materials,\" he says. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, we have no choice but to do the same thing.\"Asher and brother Galahad are the seventh generation of the Clark family and, 187 years on from the dawn of a footwear dynasty, they launched Vivobarefoot in 2012 with the goal of creating shoes that make you feel as close to being bare-foot as possible.They're almost plimsoll-like when it comes to weight and thinness. It takes time to get used to them if you're used to pounding the pavement in normal trainers. But the Clarks are unapologetic in their belief that they are better for our feet, keeping them closer to the ground in a wider, more natural, position.The next step is to make them better for the planet - and that's where my video game-looking feet come in. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nLook mum, my feet are in the metaverse!\n        \n\n\n\nMade to orderClark says: \"We are effectively using modern technology to make the shoes we did millennia ago.\"All feet are different, so we can only do so well in terms of putting the perfect shoe on your feet.\"The shoe industry has a long, human-intensive chain of development. It takes a long time, it's inefficient and slow because you're ordering for stock. You're making a huge bet as a business - 'is this the right shoe, will people want it' - well before you have them in stores.\"We're trying to move towards an efficient, digital model that is made person by person, locally.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe Vivobiome shoes have the same plimsoll-like weight and feel as as the company's standard sneakers\n        \n\n\n\nThe first step for a \"Vivobiome\" customer would be to scan their feet at home with a smartphone app. It would use gaming engine Unreal to create their new shoes in 3D, let them customise them and even virtually try them on.If they choose to order, the shoes would be made using 3D printing with local, sustainable materials. Clark says it would be less than a month from scanning your feet to wearing the perfectly sized shoes.It's an ambitious idea, first pitched to attendees at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, and one that seeks to disrupt an industry that shows no sign of slowing down. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe company first showed off the concept at COP26 in 2021\n        \n\n\n\nWinning over the 'sneakerheads'Encompassing mega brands like Nike, Adidas, Converse, and Vans, the global trainer market was worth more than $70bn (\u00a354bn) last year and is projected to exceed $100bn (\u00a378bn) by 2026.Given the seemingly unstoppable demand, whether it be to replace your old All Stars or grab those \"limited edition\" Stranger Things Vans, it should come as no surprise that an astonishing 20 billion pairs of shoes are made every year - many of them trainers.And perhaps even more astonishingly, 90% of them are destined to end up in landfill.Clark is unapologetic in his assessment that the planet simply can't take any more of it - and his firm's ambitious Vivobiome initiative should be up and running in full by the middle of next year.Powering it will be \"Tesla-like speed factories\", where - like Elon Musk's electric car firm - the entire shoe-making process goes under one roof. The first one will be in Ireland in 2024, with more to follow in Germany and the US. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nTesla's factories have been cited as a point of inspiration for Vivobarefoot's proposed shoe plants\n        \n\n\n\nThe price catchVivobarefoot's goal of helping the planet will only go far if the shoes are affordable - and you could certainly pick up a few pairs of sneakers for the price of what the company thinks it will charge for theirs.\"It's expensive to do things differently,\" admits Clark, who's targeting a \u00a3260 launch price.In the meantime, the company's launched a \"pioneer programme\" to put the initiative through its paces. People who successfully apply will get three pairs and will be asked to give feedback.Foot scans will begin next month, with the pairs rolled out between August and February. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord of mouth will likely be crucial to whether Vivobiome makes a fast start come launch, as there's no sign of a Michael Jordan waiting in the wings to power the brand to glory by himself.\"A company like Nike has built an emotional legacy with amazing athletes and cool products,\" says Clark.\"But I challenge that's the past. This is looking to the next phase.\"You can't doubt the ambition - but for now, Vivobiome's success is up in the Air.\n"}, {"_id": "64940b5651ac334d990dccc6", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/fresh-pain-for-borrowers-as-bank-of-england-set-to-increase-interest-rate-for-the-13th-time-in-a-row-12906992", "primaryCategory": "home", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Fresh pain for borrowers as Bank of England set to increase interest rate for the 13th time in a row", "lead": "An interest rate rise by the Bank of England at midday is a nailed-on certainty -

some might be forgiven for thinking there was every justification for a 0.5 percentage point rate hike. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n3:00\n\n\n\n\n\n'Sticky' inflation explained\n\n\n\nThe other side of the argument suggests a smaller rise would be sufficient as there is evidence that the 12 rate hikes to date, along with a natural easing in many costs, were starting to have an effect.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said wider data suggested wage growth pressures would start to reduce and that energy-linked inflation would fall sharply, allowing an easing of price growth more widely.He said of the MPC's dilemma: \"The headline rate of CPI inflation still looks set to fall sharply over the remainder of this year, probably to about 4.5% by December and to around 2% in the second half of 2024.\"He added: \"We continue to think that the MPC will not raise bank rate all the way to the near 6% level priced-in by markets before today's data; for now, our base case remains bank rate peaks at 5%.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64940b5751ac334d990dccc8", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/dozens-of-royal-air-force-personnel-forced-to-evacuate-accommodation-after-power-outage-12907375", "primaryCategory": "uk", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Dozens of military personnel forced to evacuate accommodation after power outage at RAF helicopter base", "lead": "Dozens of military personnel have been forced to evacuate their accommodation at a Royal Air Force helicopter base after a power outage left them without hot water and functioning fire alarms.", "author": "\nDeborah Haynes\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 08:57:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:50:31.154739", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-raf-stock_6195401.jpg?20230622071907", "body": "\nDozens of military personnel have been forced to evacuate their accommodation at a Royal Air Force helicopter base after a power outage left them without hot water and functioning fire alarms.The electrical fault also impacted other facilities at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, home to the Chinook squadron, Sky News has learnt.\n\n\n\nCommanders this week ordered around 80 personnel to leave their accommodation blocks and relocate temporarily to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, where they are being put up in what one source described as \"a former military hotel which is worse than the Bates Motel\".He was referring to a motel in the 1960 psychological horror thriller Psycho, by Alfred Hitchcock, which inspired a television series called the Bates Motel.Describing the mood among those affected at RAF Odiham, the source said that \"standard military bravado\" was kicking in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whilst everyone involved knows it is a rubbish situation and has a moan and a gripe, it's being laughed at too,\" the source said.But they added: \"Simple questions are being asked as to why the station doesn't have any redundancy, why is it taking 36 hours to get a generator in?\"Read more:UK will be left 'exposed' when it cuts fleet of aircraft, sources warnChina recruits British ex-military pilotsAs part of Joint Helicopter Command, the upkeep of the base is the responsibility of the army rather than the RAF, despite it being an air force base. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis \"middle ground\" meant neither service has funded necessary investments in infrastructure such as the accommodation blocks and hangars used to house Chinook helicopters, according to the source.\"Money that the RAF received over the years hasn't made it to Odiham because it was under the army, but because Odiham is an RAF base, the army didn't invest in it either,\" the source said.The promise of subsidised accommodation is one of the perks of joining the armed forces.However, the Ministry of Defence has failed to ensure the upkeep of its housing, which it outsourced to a number of private contractors.Complaints by personnel and military families about their homes -

having already hiked it from 0.1% in December 2021 to 4.5%, where it currently stands.It comes after disappointing inflation figures showed price rises have not eased, with the rate remaining at 8.7%.This puts the government's pledge to halve inflation by the end of the year in jeopardy.And high interest rates mean more expensive borrowing, sending mortgages higher.The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the move could see an estimated 1.4 million mortgage holders - half of them aged under 40 - lose more than 20% of their disposable income.The independent think tank said the average mortgage-holding household faces paying nearly \u00a3280 more each month compared with this time last year - with 30 to 39-year-olds paying nearly \u00a3360 more.It followed warnings from economists at the Resolution Foundation that annual mortgage repayments are set to rise by \u00a32,900 for the average household remortgaging next year.Meanwhile  the typical rate for a two-year fixed deal rose to 6% on Monday - a high not seen since 2008 with the exception of after Liz Truss's botched mini-budget.Ms Reeves will set out more detail of Labour's plan when she visits Boris Johnson's vacated Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat on Thursday.Read More:No decrease in inflation as it remains at 8.7%Jeremy Hunt rules out mortgage support and capping food prices \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:14\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer grills Sunak on 'mortgage catastrophe'\n\n\n\n'Tidal wave of repossessions'Seperately, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey urged ministers to act now to prevent a \"tidal wave\" of home repossessions - with an emergency mortgage protection fund paid for by a reversal of tax cuts for big banks.Analysis by the party reveals 1,250 homeowners have had to hand back the keys to their homes after falling behind on their mortgage repayments since last year's ill-fated mini-budget, which plunged the market into turmoil.Lasting for a year, the protection fund would provide targeted support in the form of grants of up to \u00a3300 a month to homeowners on the lowest incomes and those suffering from the sharpest rises in rates.There are also calls from some Conservatives to offer major financial support to defuse a \"mortgage bomb\" hitting core voters.And the Green Party stressed the need for controls on rents to prevent landlords passing on hikes on buy-to-let mortgages to tenants.Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will meet lenders on Friday to ask what help they can give to struggling borrowers and see what flexibilities they can offer to those in arrears.But Downing Street made clear the chancellor will not be forcing lenders to take action.The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"We're not seeking to intervene in commercial decisions for banks offering mortgages.\"We want banks to be offering the best possible products to consumers, that's in everyone's interest.

I just assume they will fit and if they don't, well, I can break them in - cue hobbling around with painful blisters for several weeks.But that could all soon be a distant, painful memory. Asher Clark, scion of the Clarks shoe dynasty, has a grand plan for the \"future of footwear\" and in order to investigate it, I had to get my feet physically measured.Forget the tape measure and those weird shoe shop devices, Clark instead had me step on what looked like a set of futuristic scales in the back of his Vivobarefoot store in central London, equipped with a monitor that displayed the soles of my feet in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom where I was placing all my weight (too much on the heels, not enough on the toes), to measurements for everything from \"instep girth\" to \"arch height\", it was a far cry from \"looks like a seven-and-a-half to me\".\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nI put too much weight on my heels, it seems\n        \n\n\n\nNot long after, this scales-like machine had transformed a scan of my feet into a 3D model and sent it to my phone, ready to form the basis of a bespoke pair of shoes.This, says Clark, is how we'll all want to get our new trainers one day.\"Ten thousand years ago, humans made shoes out of local materials,\" he says. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, we have no choice but to do the same thing.\"Asher and brother Galahad are the seventh generation of the Clark family and, 187 years on from the dawn of a footwear dynasty, they launched Vivobarefoot in 2012 with the goal of creating shoes that make you feel as close to being bare-foot as possible.They're almost plimsoll-like when it comes to weight and thinness. It takes time to get used to them if you're used to pounding the pavement in normal trainers. But the Clarks are unapologetic in their belief that they are better for our feet, keeping them closer to the ground in a wider, more natural, position.The next step is to make them better for the planet - and that's where my video game-looking feet come in. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nLook mum, my feet are in the metaverse!\n        \n\n\n\nMade to orderClark says: \"We are effectively using modern technology to make the shoes we did millennia ago.\"All feet are different, so we can only do so well in terms of putting the perfect shoe on your feet.\"The shoe industry has a long, human-intensive chain of development. It takes a long time, it's inefficient and slow because you're ordering for stock. You're making a huge bet as a business - 'is this the right shoe, will people want it' - well before you have them in stores.\"We're trying to move towards an efficient, digital model that is made person by person, locally.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe Vivobiome shoes have the same plimsoll-like weight and feel as as the company's standard sneakers\n        \n\n\n\nThe first step for a \"Vivobiome\" customer would be to scan their feet at home with a smartphone app. It would use gaming engine Unreal to create their new shoes in 3D, let them customise them and even virtually try them on.If they choose to order, the shoes would be made using 3D printing with local, sustainable materials. Clark says it would be less than a month from scanning your feet to wearing the perfectly sized shoes.It's an ambitious idea, first pitched to attendees at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, and one that seeks to disrupt an industry that shows no sign of slowing down. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe company first showed off the concept at COP26 in 2021\n        \n\n\n\nWinning over the 'sneakerheads'Encompassing mega brands like Nike, Adidas, Converse, and Vans, the global trainer market was worth more than $70bn (\u00a354bn) last year and is projected to exceed $100bn (\u00a378bn) by 2026.Given the seemingly unstoppable demand, whether it be to replace your old All Stars or grab those \"limited edition\" Stranger Things Vans, it should come as no surprise that an astonishing 20 billion pairs of shoes are made every year - many of them trainers.And perhaps even more astonishingly, 90% of them are destined to end up in landfill.Clark is unapologetic in his assessment that the planet simply can't take any more of it - and his firm's ambitious Vivobiome initiative should be up and running in full by the middle of next year.Powering it will be \"Tesla-like speed factories\", where - like Elon Musk's electric car firm - the entire shoe-making process goes under one roof. The first one will be in Ireland in 2024, with more to follow in Germany and the US. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nTesla's factories have been cited as a point of inspiration for Vivobarefoot's proposed shoe plants\n        \n\n\n\nThe price catchVivobarefoot's goal of helping the planet will only go far if the shoes are affordable - and you could certainly pick up a few pairs of sneakers for the price of what the company thinks it will charge for theirs.\"It's expensive to do things differently,\" admits Clark, who's targeting a \u00a3260 launch price.In the meantime, the company's launched a \"pioneer programme\" to put the initiative through its paces. People who successfully apply will get three pairs and will be asked to give feedback.Foot scans will begin next month, with the pairs rolled out between August and February. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord of mouth will likely be crucial to whether Vivobiome makes a fast start come launch, as there's no sign of a Michael Jordan waiting in the wings to power the brand to glory by himself.\"A company like Nike has built an emotional legacy with amazing athletes and cool products,\" says Clark.\"But I challenge that's the past. This is looking to the next phase.\"You can't doubt the ambition - but for now, Vivobiome's success is up in the Air.\n"}, {"_id": "64940b5851ac334d990dcccf", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/man-arrested-as-armed-police-respond-to-incident-at-central-middlesex-hospital-in-north-west-london-12907034", "primaryCategory": "uk", "subCategories": "test", "title": "'Pickaxe-wielding attacker' wounds two at London hospital", "lead": "Witnesses say a pickaxe-wielding attacker went on a rampage at a hospital in northwest London, leaving two injured.", "author": "\nSamuel Osborne\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-21 19:25:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:50:32.936241", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-police-middlesex-hospital_6194976.jpg?20230621164321", "body": "\nWitnesses say a pickaxe-wielding attacker went on a rampage at a hospital in northwest London, leaving two injured.A man has been arrested after armed officers responded to calls of an incident at Central Middlesex Hospital at about 1.20pm on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nOne of the victims has life-threatening injuries and a second has non-life-threatening injuries, the Metropolitan Police said.A man was arrested outside the hospital and is receiving treatment for injuries believed to be self-inflicted.

though opinions are split on the level of additional pain that could be imposed as efforts to curb the country's inflation problem stumble.At the start of this week, policymakers were widely tipped to raise the base rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.75% - a record 13th consecutive increase - maintaining a slower path for hikes since March.\n\n\n\nBut the latest inflation figures, published yesterday, prompted financial market participants to anticipate a greater, almost even, chance of a half percentage point hike to 5%.\n\nWhile there were already concerns about the stubborn pace of price rises, the inflation data came as a shock.It showed price growth was becoming more engrained in the economy while the main consumer prices index (CPI) also failed to budge lower as most experts had predicted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank had also previously expressed concerns about the pace of wage rises which, it argues, contributes to demand and further inflation ahead. \n\nInflation is proving more difficult to cool than had been anticipated, and Chancellor Jeremy Hunt told Sky News last month he would even be comfortable with a recession if it brought inflation to heel.The only tool the bank has to do that, rate rises, will mean more pain for borrowers whatever today's rate decision brings. \n\n\nWOULD YOU BE AFFECTED BY AN INTEREST RATE RISE?\n\nYou can share your story, pictures or video with us using our app, private messaging or email. \n\n:: Your Report  on Sky News apps\n\n:: WhatsApp\n\n::  Email\n\nBy sending us your video footage/photographs/audio you agree we can broadcast, publish and edit the material.\n\n\nRead more: PM and chancellor face conundrum as mortgages rise -

though the majority of opinion among commentators is that a quarter-point rise will be the result.After all, the bank has consistently steered markets away from their peak rate scenarios this year and even signalled that a pause in the rate cycle was close.But the core function of the MPC is to keep inflation around a target rate of 2% - and there are signs of frustration in Whitehall that the independent Bank of England is lagging behind the curve.So at a sticky 8.7% - and with wage growth and so-called core inflation (which strips out volatile elements such as energy and food) ticking up last month - some might be forgiven for thinking there was every justification for a 0.5 percentage point rate hike. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n3:00\n\n\n\n\n\n'Sticky' inflation explained\n\n\n\nThe other side of the argument suggests a smaller rise would be sufficient as there is evidence that the 12 rate hikes to date, along with a natural easing in many costs, were starting to have an effect.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said wider data suggested wage growth pressures would start to reduce and that energy-linked inflation would fall sharply, allowing an easing of price growth more widely.He said of the MPC's dilemma: \"The headline rate of CPI inflation still looks set to fall sharply over the remainder of this year, probably to about 4.5% by December and to around 2% in the second half of 2024.\"He added: \"We continue to think that the MPC will not raise bank rate all the way to the near 6% level priced-in by markets before today's data; for now, our base case remains bank rate peaks at 5%.\"\n"}, {"_id": "64940b5d51ac334d990dccdc", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/mortgage-crisis-pm-and-chancellor-face-conundrum-as-rates-rise-and-theres-no-silver-bullet-to-end-the-crisis-12907052", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "PM and chancellor face conundrum as mortgages rise -

This would be to disinter Mortgage Interest Relief At Source (MIRAS).This was a scheme originally launched by Roy Jenkins, a former Labour chancellor, in 1969 as a way of encouraging home ownership. It enabled homeowners to set a portion of the interest payable on their mortgages against their income tax bill. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n3:07\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will mortgage rises affect you?\n\n\n\nIt was a particularly valuable tax break at a time when personal tax rates were so high. In 1983 under Sir Geoffrey Howe, a former Conservative chancellor, the allowance on which relief could be claimed was increased and extended to allow couples with joint mortgages to pool their allowances. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis latter perk was abolished by his successor Nigel Lawson in 1988, but the decision to pre-announce the move led to a rush of people borrowing more. It contributed to the housing market crash that began in late 1989.By then, MIRAS was already a hot potato, not least due to its cost. \n\n\nWOULD YOU BE AFFECTED BY AN INTEREST RATE RISE?\n\nYou can share your story, pictures or video with us using our app, private messaging or email. \n\n:: Your Report  on Sky News apps\n\n:: WhatsApp\n\n::  Email\n\nBy sending us your video footage/photographs/audio you agree we can broadcast, publish and edit the material.\n\n\nAn inquiry by the National Federation of Housing Associations, chaired by the late Prince Philip, recommended scrapping MIRAS as long ago as 1985 - but was squashed by ministers well aware of its popularity.Margaret Thatcher, the prime minister of the day, told the House of Commons on the day the report was published: \"So long as I am here, mortgage tax relief will continue.\"But the growing cost of MIRAS - and its ability to stoke house price inflation - meant its days were numbered.Ken Clarke, chancellor from 1993 to 1997, wanted to abolish the tax break but was prevented from doing so by his party's MPs. That was left to Gordon Brown, who abolished MIRAS in 2000, arguing it was a middle-class perk.Mr Brown's thinking was echoed this week by Mr Hunt.It is hard to think how any chancellor could fairly offer a generous tax break to homebuyers while not also providing financial support to the millions of renters also struggling with increased living costs. Reviving MIRAS would also be unaffordable when the government is routinely borrowing vast sums - as well as risking further stoking house price inflation.It is also questionable whether MIRAS would make that much of a difference to the finances of homeowners struggling with their mortgages.By the time Mr Brown abolished it, successive governments had already trimmed its generosity, to the extent that it was worth only \u00a324 per month to the average homeowner - and, even then, it still cost the Treasury getting on for \u00a32bn in today's money. A more generous scheme would cost considerably more.Read more:The solution to bringing down inflation is a political nightmare for the ToriesMortgage misery: What is causing the crunch, will it get worse and what can you do if you are struggling?'Eyewatering' hit to 1.4 million, mainly young, mortgage customers ahead, IFS warns \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n1:14\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmer questions Sunak on 'mortgage catastrophe'\n\n\n\nRachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, has come up with a package of five proposals that would require lenders to allow borrowers struggling with their mortgage to temporarily switch to interest-only payments; to allow borrowers to lengthen the term of their mortgage period; to reverse any support measures when the borrower requests; to wait a minimum of six months before initiating repossession proceedings, and ordering the Financial Conduct Authority to ensure any homeowner taking advantage of such moves would not hurt a borrower's credit rating.Those proposals, as it happens, are not that different from the kind of measures that UK Finance, the industry body for the financial services sector, envisages being implemented if more homeowners do start to struggle with mortgage payments.It has said lenders stand ready to offer \"part payment\" plans, under which borrowers pay a reduced amount covering the interest and some of the loan amount, or mortgage term extensions where the length of the mortgage is extended to reduce the monthly repayment amount. It too is also offering temporary switches to interest-only mortgages and payment concessions where appropriate.The similarity between the industry's proposals and those made by the shadow chancellor is not a coincidence. Earlier in her career, Ms Reeves worked for Halifax, the UK's biggest mortgage provider, where during the global financial crisis she witnessed first-hand the pain that was being felt by homeowners as mortgages became more scarce. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n3:52\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage mortgage rate rises above 6%\n\n\n\nBoth sets of proposals will be seen as pragmatic and not least because they do not imply a rise in government spending.Another proposal, favoured by, among others, the Housing Secretary Michael Gove, is for the widespread take-up of 25 or 30-year mortgages along the lines of those common in the US.This, like bringing back MIRAS, is not a particularly new idea.Mr Brown commissioned David Miles, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, to look into the viability of longer-term fixed-rate mortgages as long ago as 2003.Such mortgages do exist already and are provided by specialist lenders.But take-up of such products has been low because customers have tended, in the past, not to regard them as good value. Were the government looking to encourage take-up, there are also structural issues in the mortgage market that would need addressing.In the UK, banks finance mortgages using the deposits of savers. In the US, lenders borrow to finance the mortgages they provide, with government-sponsored bodies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac parcelling up their home loans and selling them on. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething like that might be needed here were there to be widespread take-up or 25 or 30-year mortgages.There is also a cultural factor at play here. British mortgage borrowers are more culturally attuned to shopping around for shorter-dated fixed rate deals than applying for 25 or 30-year mortgages. They also tend to borrow as much as they can when taking out a mortgage. In European countries - where longer-dated mortgages are more common than in the UK, such as France - there tend to be quite strict limits on how much can be borrowed.So don't fall for thinking there is a magic bullet to solve the problems of homeowners struggling to keep up their mortgage payments.The best that can be hoped for, in all probability, is greater flexibility on the part of lenders.\n"}, {"_id": "64940b5d51ac334d990dccdd", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/hs2-pause-designed-to-save-money-is-costing-the-taxpayer-more-than-163360m-leaked-govt-briefing-reveals-12907338", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "HS2 'pause' designed to save money is costing the taxpayer more than &#163;360m, leaked govt briefing reveals", "lead": "Delays to HS2 announced by the government earlier this year in order to help &#8216;balance the books&#8217; are likely to cost the taxpayer at least &#163;366 million, according to new analysis exclusively leaked to Sky News.", "author": "\nAmanda Akass\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 01:21:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:50:37.841416", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/21/11/70x70/skynews-daily-climate-show_5587400.jpg?20211118191904", "body": "\nDelays to HS2 announced by the government earlier this year in order to help \u2018balance the books\u2019 are likely to cost the taxpayer at least \u00a3366 million, according to new analysis exclusively leaked to Sky News.The government briefing also predicts the two-year pause to construction work on a key section is actually set to last 3.5 years - because of the additional time needed to ramp up the work.\n\n\n\nHS2 is a central part of the government's levelling up agenda, designed to improve rail connections between cities in the Midlands and the North with London.Back in March the Department for Transport said work on the crucial leg between Birmingham and Crewe - which is then due to continue to Manchester - would have to be put on hold because of the impact of inflation.And in April the Transport Secretary confirmed that work has also been stopped for two years at London's Euston station.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince construction began there six years ago, hundreds of homes and businesses have been demolished - but now the huge building site is virtually empty.Read more: Euston HS2 delays would mean extra costs and higher spending, watchdog warns \n\nMore on Hs2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  HS2 delays won't save money, minister admits\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Euston HS2 delays would mean extra costs and higher spending, watchdog warns\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Leaked document shows HS2 delay will increase costs, says Labour\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics:\nHS2\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh MP said: \"The chaotic indecision and mismanagement of 13 years of HS2 has held back \u00a330 billion of economic growth.

I just assume they will fit and if they don't, well, I can break them in - cue hobbling around with painful blisters for several weeks.But that could all soon be a distant, painful memory. Asher Clark, scion of the Clarks shoe dynasty, has a grand plan for the \"future of footwear\" and in order to investigate it, I had to get my feet physically measured.Forget the tape measure and those weird shoe shop devices, Clark instead had me step on what looked like a set of futuristic scales in the back of his Vivobarefoot store in central London, equipped with a monitor that displayed the soles of my feet in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom where I was placing all my weight (too much on the heels, not enough on the toes), to measurements for everything from \"instep girth\" to \"arch height\", it was a far cry from \"looks like a seven-and-a-half to me\".\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nI put too much weight on my heels, it seems\n        \n\n\n\nNot long after, this scales-like machine had transformed a scan of my feet into a 3D model and sent it to my phone, ready to form the basis of a bespoke pair of shoes.This, says Clark, is how we'll all want to get our new trainers one day.\"Ten thousand years ago, humans made shoes out of local materials,\" he says. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, we have no choice but to do the same thing.\"Asher and brother Galahad are the seventh generation of the Clark family and, 187 years on from the dawn of a footwear dynasty, they launched Vivobarefoot in 2012 with the goal of creating shoes that make you feel as close to being bare-foot as possible.They're almost plimsoll-like when it comes to weight and thinness. It takes time to get used to them if you're used to pounding the pavement in normal trainers. But the Clarks are unapologetic in their belief that they are better for our feet, keeping them closer to the ground in a wider, more natural, position.The next step is to make them better for the planet - and that's where my video game-looking feet come in. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nLook mum, my feet are in the metaverse!\n        \n\n\n\nMade to orderClark says: \"We are effectively using modern technology to make the shoes we did millennia ago.\"All feet are different, so we can only do so well in terms of putting the perfect shoe on your feet.\"The shoe industry has a long, human-intensive chain of development. It takes a long time, it's inefficient and slow because you're ordering for stock. You're making a huge bet as a business - 'is this the right shoe, will people want it' - well before you have them in stores.\"We're trying to move towards an efficient, digital model that is made person by person, locally.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe Vivobiome shoes have the same plimsoll-like weight and feel as as the company's standard sneakers\n        \n\n\n\nThe first step for a \"Vivobiome\" customer would be to scan their feet at home with a smartphone app. It would use gaming engine Unreal to create their new shoes in 3D, let them customise them and even virtually try them on.If they choose to order, the shoes would be made using 3D printing with local, sustainable materials. Clark says it would be less than a month from scanning your feet to wearing the perfectly sized shoes.It's an ambitious idea, first pitched to attendees at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, and one that seeks to disrupt an industry that shows no sign of slowing down. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe company first showed off the concept at COP26 in 2021\n        \n\n\n\nWinning over the 'sneakerheads'Encompassing mega brands like Nike, Adidas, Converse, and Vans, the global trainer market was worth more than $70bn (\u00a354bn) last year and is projected to exceed $100bn (\u00a378bn) by 2026.Given the seemingly unstoppable demand, whether it be to replace your old All Stars or grab those \"limited edition\" Stranger Things Vans, it should come as no surprise that an astonishing 20 billion pairs of shoes are made every year - many of them trainers.And perhaps even more astonishingly, 90% of them are destined to end up in landfill.Clark is unapologetic in his assessment that the planet simply can't take any more of it - and his firm's ambitious Vivobiome initiative should be up and running in full by the middle of next year.Powering it will be \"Tesla-like speed factories\", where - like Elon Musk's electric car firm - the entire shoe-making process goes under one roof.

while garnering positive reviews - required a series of technical upgrades.Those modifications were affected by the supply chain issues hampering global automotive production, forcing the Woking-based company to slow production and customer deliveries of the Artura until the end of last year.It emerged late last year that Mumtalakat had acquired part of McLaren's valuable heritage car collection as part of a further \u00a3100m financial commitment to the business.The most recent injection of funds have been earmarked for investment in McLaren Automotive, with its Racing subsidiary now a standalone entity within the group and not in need of additional financial support.Last year, McLaren named former Ferrari executive Michael Leiters as the boss of its road-car division.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company was forced into a far-reaching restructuring that saw hundreds of jobs axed and substantial sums raised in equity and debt to repair its balance sheet.In its racing division, which includes the Formula One cars driven this year by Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, McLaren has also witnessed a turnaround under Zak Brown, who leads that arm of the company.McLaren has also undertaken a series of corporate transactions since the start of the pandemic, when it sought a government loan - a request which was rebuffed by ministers.Mr Walsh has also overseen the sale of a stake in McLaren Racing to a separate group of investors, as well as a \u00a3170m sale-and-leaseback of its spectacular Surrey headquarters.In 2021, it also sold McLaren Applied Technologies, which generates revenue from sales to corporate customers.Founded in 1963 by Bruce McLaren, the group possesses one of the most famous names in British motorsport.During half a century of competing in F1, it has won the constructors' championship eight times, while its drivers have included the likes of Mika Hakkinen, Lewis Hamilton, Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna.In total, the team has won 180 Grands Prix, three Indianapolis 500s and the Le Mans 24 Hours on its debut.The company saw its separate divisions reunited following the departure in 2017 of Ron Dennis, the veteran McLaren boss who had steered its F1 team through the most successful period in its history.Mr Dennis offloaded his stake in a \u00a3275m deal following a bitter dispute with fellow shareholders.McLaren and Mumtalakat declined to comment.PIF could not be reached for comment.\n"}, {"_id": "64940b5f51ac334d990dcce0", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/rothschild8217s-volex-taps-investors-to-fund-163135m-turkish-takeover-12907264", "primaryCategory": "business", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Rothschild&#8217;s Volex taps investors to fund &#163;135m Turkish takeover", "lead": "The industrial manufacturer headed by Nat Rothschild, the prominent financier, is to tap shareholders in a cash call to fund its biggest acquisition to date.", "author": "\nMark Kleinman\n", "datePublished": "2023-06-22 02:28:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:50:39.019639", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/05/70x70/skynews-rothschild-nathaniel_6158425.jpg?20230517173411", "body": "\nThe industrial manufacturer headed by Nat Rothschild, the prominent financier, is to tap shareholders in a cash call to fund its biggest acquisition to date.Sky News has learnt that Volex, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, will announce on Thursday that it has struck a roughly-$175m (\u00a3137m) deal to buy Murat Ticaret, a Turkish manufacturer of complex wire harnesses.\n\n\n\nThe deal will be funded in part by a share sale that will seek to raise about \u00a355m, and is expected to be announced alongside the results.The cash call will comprise a placing and retail offering to shareholders, one investor suggested on Wednesday evening.If completed, it will mark a further transformational step for Volex, whose value has soared since Mr Rothschild came to the helm in 2015 after a brief spell as a non-executive director.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurat Ticaret is headquartered in Turkey and has significant global exposure to the off-highway manufacturing market in sectors such as agricultural and construction machinery, as well as commercial vehicles.It serves customers including JCB, Bobcat and John Deere, supplying them with specially designed systems to keep myriad wires or cables organized within a machine.A person familiar with Volex said it would be the company's 11th acquisition since 2019, describing the Turkish deal as \"transformational\" by increasing its scale significantly and giving it access to a new market beyond the electric vehicles, consumer electricals, medical and complex industrials sectors.The deal would also represent a significant step forward in achieving Volex's five-year plan, announced by executive chairman Mr Rothschild last year, in which the group said it would deliver $1.2bn (\u00a3939m) in revenue by the end of its 2027 financial year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts said that Murat Ticaret's 2022 sales of $170m (\u00a3133m) combined with Volex's annual revenues -

And that's where we are now.\"People are starting to realise that the road back to 2% inflation is far trickier and more hazardous than they realised, and it can also take a long time.\"See how your spending has gone up compared to five years ago \n\nThe price of a can of baked beans has nearly doubled since 2018 from 56p up to \u00a31.07, the biggest food price increase over the period. A pack of frozen burgers has increased by 65%, from \u00a32.01 in January 2018 up to \u00a33.32 now.The item with the biggest increase in the shopping basket was a day's car hire, which has increased from \u00a337.63 in 2018 to \u00a378.80 now. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrexit and the pandemic have contributed to price rises2020 saw the double shock of the UK's official exit from the European Union at the end of January, closely followed by the global COVID pandemic with lockdowns starting in March.Initially, inflation remained low as the nation headed into lockdown and spent less money. Once lockdowns had eased in 2021, pent-up demand combined with supply disruptions saw prices increase rapidly.Paula Bejarano Carbo, associate economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told Sky News that COVID-related supply chain issues were a major driver of inflationary momentum in 2021:\"There was a sudden overheating of the UK economy.\"The UK is not a country that typically has a very high savings rate. But over the pandemic there was excess saving as people were not able to spend.\"As soon as restrictions started lifting people started spending quite quickly and there was excess demand in the economy which pushed up prices.\" \n\nSome household DIY items have seen the biggest price rises since 2020. MDF fireboard has gone up 73%, from \u00a318.59 to \u00a332.16, while a box of ceramic tiles has increased from \u00a311.39 to \u00a318.08.Some 29 of the top 50 price increases since 2020 are within the food and drink category.Researchers at The Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics have looked at isolating the inflationary impact of Brexit from other recent economic events.Their latest report suggests that Brexit contributed an additional 30 percentage points to food price inflation between December 2019 and March 2023, with food prices increasing by 25% over the time period. Had the UK not exited the European Union, their analysis estimates, the increase would have been 17%.Nikhil Datta, assistant professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Warwick, who co-authored the research, told Sky News that non-tariff trade barriers - border frictions other than taxes - were the biggest driver of Brexit-specific inflation.He said: \"When we say frictions, we mean things which are going to make it costly for firms to move things across borders. Food products in particular face quite a few of these as a result of regulatory differences across different countries.\"Firms may also be anticipating future issues and hiring additional employees or consultants to assist with border frictions, and adapting prices accordingly.\"So, when adhering to regulations at the border there is the cost of actually doing it at the border, like the veterinary check, but there's also the fact that you've got to change the structure of your business somewhat.\"That is part of what we're seeing now. When we start seeing these hard checks at the border [in the future], these price increases might be larger. Or it could be that actually businesses have already taken these into account in their current pricing structure.\"Food prices have rocketed since Russia invaded UkraineThen came Russia's invasion of Ukraine, sending further shocks through the international economy. Energy, fertiliser and grain prices rise significantly last year, with a particularly big impact on food and fuel bills. \n\nThe price of olive oil increased more than any other food product since 2022, rising by 58% from \u00a33.91 to \u00a36.16.None of the 152 types of food tracked by the ONS have become cheaper since February 2022. Only cereal bars have managed to avoid any price increase, staying at 31p.Persistent inflation has knock on effects on the rest of the economy, and the Bank of England has been raising interest rates in an attempt to control price rises.Stuart Parkinson explained: \"Central bankers have created a host of ways to manage financial shocks in the past 20 years - and, let's face it, they've also had plenty of practice.\"But their inflation-fighting toolkit is much more limited, and their main tool - raising interest rates - inflicts a lot of collateral damage in the process, hence their reticence to deploy it to its fullest effect.\"MethodologyThe ONS collects these prices by visiting thousands of shops across the country and noting down the prices of specific items. There are upwards of 100,000 prices published every month, from more than 600 products.The items that form the \"official shopping basket\" change each year to reflect how the purchasing habits of the population have changed. For example in March 2021, after a year of the pandemic, hand gel, loungewear bottoms and dumbbells were added, while canteen-bought sandwiches were among the items removed.Where there aren't the exact equivalent items available at a survey shop, ONS officials pick the best alternative and note that they've done this so it's weighted correctly when the averages are worked out.Shops are weighted as well, so the price in a major chain supermarket will have a greater impact on the average than an independent corner shop.During the pandemic, more of the survey was carried out over the phone and work is ongoing to digitise the system to be able to take in more price points by getting data from supermarket receipts, rather than making personal visits.The Data and Forensics team is a multi-skilled unit dedicated to providing transparent journalism from Sky News.

Benefits payments increased in line with the inflation rate of 10.1% recorded in January.Public sector debt topped \u00a32.567trn at the end of May, equivalent to 100.1% of GDP.

Asher Clark, scion of the Clarks shoe dynasty, has a grand plan for the \"future of footwear\" and in order to investigate it, I had to get my feet physically measured.Forget the tape measure and those weird shoe shop devices, Clark instead had me step on what looked like a set of futuristic scales in the back of his Vivobarefoot store in central London, equipped with a monitor that displayed the soles of my feet in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom where I was placing all my weight (too much on the heels, not enough on the toes), to measurements for everything from \"instep girth\" to \"arch height\", it was a far cry from \"looks like a seven-and-a-half to me\".\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nI put too much weight on my heels, it seems\n        \n\n\n\nNot long after, this scales-like machine had transformed a scan of my feet into a 3D model and sent it to my phone, ready to form the basis of a bespoke pair of shoes.This, says Clark, is how we'll all want to get our new trainers one day.\"Ten thousand years ago, humans made shoes out of local materials,\" he says. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, we have no choice but to do the same thing.\"Asher and brother Galahad are the seventh generation of the Clark family and, 187 years on from the dawn of a footwear dynasty, they launched Vivobarefoot in 2012 with the goal of creating shoes that make you feel as close to being bare-foot as possible.They're almost plimsoll-like when it comes to weight and thinness. It takes time to get used to them if you're used to pounding the pavement in normal trainers. But the Clarks are unapologetic in their belief that they are better for our feet, keeping them closer to the ground in a wider, more natural, position.The next step is to make them better for the planet - and that's where my video game-looking feet come in. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nLook mum, my feet are in the metaverse!\n        \n\n\n\nMade to orderClark says: \"We are effectively using modern technology to make the shoes we did millennia ago.\"All feet are different, so we can only do so well in terms of putting the perfect shoe on your feet.\"The shoe industry has a long, human-intensive chain of development. It takes a long time, it's inefficient and slow because you're ordering for stock. You're making a huge bet as a business - 'is this the right shoe, will people want it' - well before you have them in stores.\"We're trying to move towards an efficient, digital model that is made person by person, locally.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe Vivobiome shoes have the same plimsoll-like weight and feel as as the company's standard sneakers\n        \n\n\n\nThe first step for a \"Vivobiome\" customer would be to scan their feet at home with a smartphone app. It would use gaming engine Unreal to create their new shoes in 3D, let them customise them and even virtually try them on.If they choose to order, the shoes would be made using 3D printing with local, sustainable materials. Clark says it would be less than a month from scanning your feet to wearing the perfectly sized shoes.It's an ambitious idea, first pitched to attendees at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, and one that seeks to disrupt an industry that shows no sign of slowing down. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe company first showed off the concept at COP26 in 2021\n        \n\n\n\nWinning over the 'sneakerheads'Encompassing mega brands like Nike, Adidas, Converse, and Vans, the global trainer market was worth more than $70bn (\u00a354bn) last year and is projected to exceed $100bn (\u00a378bn) by 2026.Given the seemingly unstoppable demand, whether it be to replace your old All Stars or grab those \"limited edition\" Stranger Things Vans, it should come as no surprise that an astonishing 20 billion pairs of shoes are made every year - many of them trainers.And perhaps even more astonishingly, 90% of them are destined to end up in landfill.Clark is unapologetic in his assessment that the planet simply can't take any more of it - and his firm's ambitious Vivobiome initiative should be up and running in full by the middle of next year.Powering it will be \"Tesla-like speed factories\", where - like Elon Musk's electric car firm - the entire shoe-making process goes under one roof. The first one will be in Ireland in 2024, with more to follow in Germany and the US. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nTesla's factories have been cited as a point of inspiration for Vivobarefoot's proposed shoe plants\n        \n\n\n\nThe price catchVivobarefoot's goal of helping the planet will only go far if the shoes are affordable - and you could certainly pick up a few pairs of sneakers for the price of what the company thinks it will charge for theirs.\"It's expensive to do things differently,\" admits Clark, who's targeting a \u00a3260 launch price.In the meantime, the company's launched a \"pioneer programme\" to put the initiative through its paces. People who successfully apply will get three pairs and will be asked to give feedback.Foot scans will begin next month, with the pairs rolled out between August and February. \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWord of mouth will likely be crucial to whether Vivobiome makes a fast start come launch, as there's no sign of a Michael Jordan waiting in the wings to power the brand to glory by himself.\"A company like Nike has built an emotional legacy with amazing athletes and cool products,\" says Clark.\"But I challenge that's the past. This is looking to the next phase.\"You can't doubt the ambition - but for now, Vivobiome's success is up in the Air.\n"}, {"_id": "64940b6551ac334d990dccf2", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/pixel-tablet-googles-latest-comes-with-a-twist-but-can-it-find-an-audience-12905398", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Google's so committed to its new tablet design - you can't buy it without one key feature", "lead": "As smartphone screens have got bigger, and laptops more powerful, tablets have gone through something of an identity crisis.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-20 09:21:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:50:45.348869", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-google-pixel-tablet_6192451.png?20230619144749", "body": "\nAs smartphone screens have got bigger, and laptops more powerful, tablets have gone through something of an identity crisis.Once pitched as an obvious middle ground between the computer in your pocket and the one on your lap, the thinking behind them seems increasingly muddled.\n\n\n\nThere are iPads for people who want a keyboard and powerful processor (but not a laptop?), and those who want a small screen (but not a bigger phone?).Samsung makes tablets, occasionally with a stylus, while also making phones that fold out into screens even bigger than some tablets. And don't forget Amazon's various Kindles and Microsoft's array of Surfaces.If your head hurts thinking about them all, you're not alone. As someone who recently helped research a new family tablet purchase, it's more difficult than ever to know which models to choose from as use cases vary so wildly.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Google from coming up with yet another use case for a tablet - what if it was also a smart home display?The Pixel Tablet launches today into a field more crowded than ever, priced \u00a3599. It's got the same chip as the company's flagship Pixel 7 smartphones, an 11-inch screen, and a bunch of apps optimised to take advantage.But the standout feature is the dock, which you slap the tablet on to with some powerful magnets and effectively transforms the device into a home hub.You can see information like time and weather, have it cycle through photos, play music from the in-built speakers, control your lights, and its \"Hey Google\" voice assistant is always listening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nThe tablet is designed to be placed on a dock when not in active use\u2026\n        \n\n\n\nNo dock, no diceThe idea is that rather than leave it teetering on the arm of the sofa, down the side of the bed, or worse still at the mercy of your children, you pop it on the dock and make it the centre of your smart home.Google's so committed to this idea, you can't buy the tablet without the dock.It's a very different approach to that taken by other tech companies, and almost seems as much designed to target Amazon's dominance in the smart speaker market as Apple's in the tablet space.Of course, at \u00a3599, it comes in much more expensive than your average home hub - even the pricier ones like Amazon's Echo Show and Google's own Nest Hub.Google has long made great and popular smartphones, and its Pixel range is one of the very best for anyone who favours the Android operating system.But the search giant has never quite found solid footing in the tablet space, and its previous attempt offered a completely different pitch to today's release. The Pixel Slate, from 2018, was a pricey Frankenstein-esque bid to combine tablet with Chromebook, and it was discontinued after just two years.Sceptics will no doubt suspect a similar fate awaits the Pixel Tablet. Google certainly has history when it comes to killing off products and services beyond just misguided tablets, with its Glass headset and Stadia games platform (dead after two and three years, respectively) among the most high-profile examples. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\n\u2026and used as a normal tablet when picked up\n        \n\n\n\nBut as you'd expect, its executives are bullish about the Pixel Tablet and the tech is impressive.The thicker bezels and matte finish make it nice and grippy, albeit less premium feeling; it's really fast; offers eight megapixel cameras on the front and back, which work especially well for video calling; and Google promises the battery will survive 12 hours of video streaming.And while Android has never felt nearly as at home on a tablet as on a phone, during our hands-on time we found popular apps - from Google's own like YouTube and Gmail to others like Disney+ and WhatsApp - were rather well optimised and could be used split-screen.The Pixel Tablet also supports multiple accounts, making it more shareable among a household than Apple's iPad, which will help put parents' minds at ease.Most importantly, the dock works as advertised, turning the tablet into an attractive fixture of your living room, with pretty solid speakers for playing music, radio, and podcasts.Read more:Google's first folding phone has eye-watering price\u2026\u2026but it's still some way cheaper than Apple's new headset \n\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that ever more muddled space between smartphones and tablets, Google will hope its decision to have it flirt with the smart home market proves a master stroke.Considering its history with new products, we'll know in about two years.\n"}, {"_id": "64940b6551ac334d990dccf3", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/windrush-tales-how-one-of-britains-worst-scandals-changed-the-course-of-landmark-game-12899344", "primaryCategory": "technology", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How one of Britain's worst scandals changed the course of landmark game", "lead": "Imagine packing for a journey into the unknown, unsure of how long you'll be gone, or if you'll ever return home.", "author": "None", "datePublished": "2023-06-18 17:42:00", "dateScraped": "2023-06-22 10:50:45.937347", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "SkyNews", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/06/70x70/skynews-corey-brotherson-chella-ramanan_6187453.jpg?20230614171753", "body": "\nImagine packing for a journey into the unknown, unsure of how long you'll be gone, or if you'll ever return home.Do you fill your case with shorts and sandals or a warm jacket?

One an aspiring nurse, Rose, the other her older brother, Vernon. Apprehensive but tenacious, Rose follows her sibling to England and plans to start work as a nurse in the newly formed NHS.Vernon has been in Britain for several years but, unknown to his sister, has struggled to find and stay in work. Through his photography, he documents their attempts to adapt to life in Britain, from grassroots arts and activism, to church and social clubs. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nChella Ramanan, creative director of Windrush Tales\n        \n\n\n\nFor the 3-Fold team, predominantly made up of black British Caribbean employees, Windrush Tales was seen as an opportunity to tell the types of stories rarely seen in games, which are typically dominated by big budget shooters, sports titles, and huge TV and film franchises.Just 5% of people working in games in the UK are black, according to the 2022 census by industry trade body Ukie, compared to 66% being white British. And the figures are reflected on screen - a 2021 diversity study by gaming website Diamond Lobby, of more than 100 of the best-selling titles from the previous five years, found 54% of main characters are white, while just 8% are non-white women.But the celebratory focus of Windrush Tales shifted when, with pre-production barely under way, news broke of a scandal that shook the team's faith to its core. \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:40\n\n\n\n\n\n'People traumatised' by Windrush scandal\n\n\n\nThe Windrush scandalBack in 2018, with the 70th anniversary of the Windrush's arrival on the horizon, it emerged that many of those who made the same journey over subsequent decades had been wrongly detained, deported, and denied legal rights by a \"hostile environment policy\" that cracked down on those deemed to have arrived in the UK illegally.Some of those deported later died.Among those worst affected by the government's policy, introduced by the then home secretary Theresa May in 2012, were members of the Windrush generation - who arrived in the UK legally, and with the government's encouragement, between 1948 and 1973. Many, like Rose, took jobs in the NHS - and other sectors impacted by Britain's post-war labour shortage.While indefinite leave to remain was automatically granted upon their arrival in the UK, many weren't issued with any documents confirming their status and were later unable to prove their right to stay when immigration officers came knocking. Jobs and properties were lost, health care and benefits were denied, and in the worst cases, people were deported to countries they barely knew.Read more:Home Office knew policy would hit Windrush generation \n\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player\n\n\n\n0:59\n\n\n\n\n\nI felt like an alien, says Windrush scandal victim\n\n\n\n'A generation were pushed aside'The game's writer Corey Brotherson - who is also a descendant of the Windrush generation - says the scandal shifted the \"entire tone\" of the game, and gave the team extra purpose in their work.\"For a lot of people, Windrush was something that was either not known about much or forgotten,\" he says. \"The contributions of the Windrush generation were pushed aside.

One of his grandfather's first experiences was being ripped off by a taxi driver, and he also struggled for acceptance in the workplace.\"My grandad was a hard worker, but sometimes it was difficult to find work,\" Brotherson says. \"Sometimes if he got a promotion, his white co-workers would be antagonistic towards him.\"It was typical of the racism, bigotry and pushback his generation experienced when they were trying to establish themselves.\" \n\n\n\n\n\nImage:\nCorey Brotherson, writer of Windrush Tales.
