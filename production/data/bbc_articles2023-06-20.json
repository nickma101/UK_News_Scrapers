Do you want pliers involved? Do you want a screwdriver?\" The resulting video was \"the most grotesque thing I have ever seen,\" he said.<br/>McCartney, a former motorcycle gang member who spent time in prison before entering the monkey torture world, ended up running several Telegram groups in which hardcore torture enthusiasts distributed videos. <br/>\"It's no different than drug money,\" he said. \"Drug money comes from dirty hands, this money comes from bloody hands.\"<br/>The BBC also identified two other key suspects who are now being investigated by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - Stacey Storey, a grandmother in her 40s from Alabama who was known in the community as \"Sadistic\", and a ringleader known as \"Mr Ape\" - whose real name we cannot reveal for safety reasons.<br/>\"Mr Ape\" confessed in an interview with the BBC that he had been responsible for the deaths of at least four monkeys and the torture of many more. He had commissioned \"extremely brutal\" videos, he said.<br/>Storey's phone was seized by Department of Homeland Security agents, who found nearly 100 torture videos, as well as evidence that she had paid for the creation of some of the most extreme videos produced. <br/>According to police sources, Storey was active in a torture group as recently as earlier this month. Approached by the BBC in Alabama in January, Storey claimed that she had been hacked and declined to comment on the allegations in detail. <br/>\"Mr Ape\", Stacey Storey and Mike McCartney are three of five key targets in the ongoing Homeland Security investigation. They have yet to be charged, but could face up to seven years in prison if prosecuted based on evidence gathered by the DHS.<br/>Special Agent Paul Wolpert, who is leading the DHS investigation, said everyone involved from law enforcement had been deeply shocked by the nature of the alleged crimes.<br/>\"I don't know if anybody would ever be ready for a crime like this,\" he said. \"The same with the attorneys and the juries, and anybody who reads that this is going on. It is going to be a shocker I think.\"<br/>Anybody involved in buying or distributing the monkey torture videos should \"expect a knock on the door at some point\", Agent Wolpert said. \"You are not going to get away with it.\"<br/>Police in Indonesia have arrested two torture suspects. Asep Yadi Nurul Hikmah was charged with animal torture and the sale of a protected species, and sentenced to three years in prison. M Ajis Rasjana was sentenced to eight months - the maximum sentence available for torturing an animal.<br/>Monkey torture videos are still easily accessible on Telegram and now Facebook, where the BBC recently found dozens of groups sharing extreme content, some with more than 1,000 members.<br/>\"We've seen an escalation in this extreme, graphic content, which used to be hidden but is now circulating openly on platforms like Facebook,\" said Sarah Kite, co-founder of animal charity Action for Primates. <br/>Facebook told the BBC it had removed the groups we brought to the company's attention. \"We don't allow the promotion of animal abuse on our platforms and we remove this content when we become aware of it, like we did in this case,\" a spokesperson said.<br/>Ms Kite also called for UK laws to be updated to make it easier to prosecute individuals who pay for torture videos to be made. \"If someone is proactively involved in inflicting that pain by paying for it and providing a list of things they want done to the animal, there should be stronger laws to hold them to account,\" she said.<br/>YouTube told the BBC in a statement that animal abuse had \"no place\" on the platform and the company was \"working hard to quickly remove violative content\". <br/>\"Just this year alone, we've removed hundreds of thousands of videos and terminated thousands of channels for violating our violent and graphic policies,\" the statement said.<br/>Telegram said it was \"committed to protecting user privacy and human rights such as freedom of speech\", adding that its moderators \"cannot proactively patrol private groups\".<br/>The Monkey Haters<br/>You can read the full story on the BBC News website, watch the documentary The Monkey Haters on BBC iPlayer (UK only), on YouTube, or listen to the radio version on BBC Sounds. <br/>Hunting the monkey torturers<br/>Catching the men who sell subway groping videos<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

A small rise in percentage terms can still have a significant effect on people's finances.<br/>If a first-time buyer had a mortgage on the same property, that would take up 26% of pay, it said.<br/>The chunk of income taken up by rent varies in different regions. Even in London, where rent has previously taken up a bigger proportion of wages, the cost still accounts for 40% of gross earnings - the highest in the UK.<br/>Rents have been rising significantly for the last year. Although those on a fixed rent would not have seen a difference, those signing up to new contracts, or moving to a different property are likely to have seen big increases.<br/>The pressure of rising mortgage rates faced by landlords, as well as higher demand for properties than the number made available, have combined to raise the costs for tenants.<br/>The typical rise has been at more than 10%, compared with a year earlier, for 15 months in a row.<br/>In April, rent in London was 13.5% higher than a year ago, in Scotland it was 13.1% higher, and the North West of England saw a 10.5% increase.<br/>\"The impact of higher rents is not uniform with those on low incomes bearing the brunt, with increasing signs of stress,\" Mr Donnell said.<br/>Those trying to move from renting to buying their own home also face greater difficulty in securing a mortgage. Financial information service Moneyfacts said the number of deals available for someone offering a 5% deposit was down from 347 at the start of June last year to 199 now.<br/>There's more on your renting rights and where to go for help here.<br/>Mr Ward is among those renters feeling the squeeze, even though he is in a relatively well-paid job.<br/>He said he and his girlfriend's \u00a31,750 a month budget was regarded as low by agents, so they felt they were being priced out of London.<br/>He said that the situation was all the more \"absurd\" because of the competition for properties. The couple are now considering getting a visa to work overseas, for a better quality of life.<br/>One of the major reasons for higher rents is that there are lots of tenants chasing a smaller number of properties to rent.<br/>Zoopla said that there are 20% to 40% fewer homes to rent in most regions than there were before the pandemic. Meanwhile there are many more tenants than has been seen on average over the last five years.<br/>This was likely to become more acute as demand traditionally picks up during the summer months.<br/>Edinburgh and Glasgow feature high on the rental league table, partly because they score highly on quality of life and strong job markets, but there's more going on behind those numbers.<br/>The cities' universities have gone on a recruiting spree for foreign students, putting pressure on the rental market.<br/>And the alliance of SNP with Scottish Green ministers in the Scottish government have risked distorting the market with rent controls. <br/>A freeze in rents and evictions was introduced last September and lasted until March. Also to help households facing rising costs, there's now a 3% cap on rent increases until next March. Further and more permanent rent controls are expected in Holyrood legislation later this year, being drawn up by Green MSP and minister for tenants' rights Patrick Harvie.<br/>However, there is no constraint on the rents at which landlords can advertise new tenancies. So according to property professionals, newly-advertised rents have risen, as landlords seek to protect their income against the impact of future constraints once tenants have moved in.<br/>Zoopla's rental sector survey, published every three months, tracks the rents that landlords request when listing a property, but analysts also adjust the numbers to reflect the rent that is eventually agreed.<br/>Homeowners have been hit by rising interest, and mortgage rates, and that has spilled over into the buy-to-let market - which often sees even higher mortgage rates.<br/>Up to a third of landlords who have hefty mortgages are facing the biggest impact of rising interest rates, which are going up further than previously expected.<br/>Last week estate agency Savills said landlords were making their lowest profits for 16 years as interest rates rose.<br/>In a recent report, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that higher rates, and stricter laws, were pushing some landlords to consider selling up. That would create a further squeeze on availability and could, in turn, increase the cost of renting further.<br/>Are you a tenant with a view on the cost of rent?

He did not elaborate, but vowed to hunt down the militants in their hide-outs across the border in the Democratic Republic of Congo.<br/>The ADF has not yet commented. <br/>It was formed in the 1990s and took up arms against Mr Museveni, alleging persecution of the minority Muslims population.<br/>Its leader reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group in 2016.<br/>But it was not until April 2019 that IS first acknowledged its activity in the area, when it claimed an attack on army positions near the border with Uganda.<br/>This statement marked the announcement of IS's \"Central Africa Province\" (Iscap).<br/>Six students are believed to have been abducted as the militants retreated to DR Congo.<br/>Julius was among six people who managed to survive the assault which lasted for several hours. <br/>He did not identify the attackers, but said they were gun-wielding men who launched their attack at about 22:00 local time. <br/>They came to the boys' dormitory but the students had locked it after realising they were in danger.<br/>\"When they couldn't open the door they hurled a bomb inside the dormitory and then used hammers and axes to break down the door,\" he said. <br/>Julius was standing behind many of the students who had formed a shield near the door and were shot dead when the militants got into the dormitory.<br/>There were cries as the students were gunned down, hacked or shot to death.<br/>He quickly climbed to the top of a bunk bed, removed some of the wooden planks of the ceiling, and jumped inside to hide.<br/>From there, he helplessly watched his colleagues being brutally murdered by the assailants, who then set fire to mattresses and left.<br/>\"I was overwhelmed by the smoke and dropped back down into the dormitory with a thud,\" he said.<br/>The militants heard the thud and came back.<br/>It was at that point that Julius knew he had to come out of the attack alive. <br/>\"I lay next to the bloodied bodies of my friends and thought very fast. Then I smeared a lot of blood into my ears, mouth and on my head and when the militants came, they checked my hand for a pulse and left,\" Julius said.<br/>Another survivor, Godwin Mumbere, was in the same dormitory as Julius. <br/>The 18-year-old recalled the assailants going to the girls' dormitory, dragging them out and hacking them to death with machetes.<br/>They then came to the boys' dormitory, broke down the door and started attacking the students.<br/>The bed Godwin was hiding under was overturned and his friends who were on top fell to the ground and were killed. <br/>\"The attackers saw me but thought I was dead,\" he told the BBC. <br/>But they went out and came back into the dormitory to ensure everyone was dead. <br/>\"It was at this point that they shot me in the hand and set the dorm ablaze,\" he said.<br/>Godwin was brought back to reality by the shouts of another student who said they were dying.<br/>He ran out of the dormitory, scaled the school gate and ran to a nearby hardware store through a cocoa plantation. He got to a lodge and hid under a vehicle until he was rescued.<br/>Clarice Bwambare, the senior administrator of Bwera General Hospital, told the BBC they started receiving the bodies of students and residents at around 01:00 - about three hours after the attack started on Friday night. <br/>He noted that out of the 20 bodies they received, 18 were those of students.<br/>Five survivors are currently recuperating at the hospital. One of them is a girl who is in critical condition at the intensive care unit. A surgeon advised that she cannot be moved because of a severe head injury from being hit with a hammer by the rebels.<br/>Mr Bwambare said only one body had not been claimed from the mortuary.<br/>On Sunday, grief-stricken families buried 21 of the students, according to Uganda's New Vision newspaper. <br/>Lying on his hospital bed, Julius expressed regret that he could not attend their funerals. He said he wished he was a soldier who could fight back and save the lives of his friends and colleagues. <br/>Uganda school attack: 'Gospel songs then screaming'<br/>Who are the ADF?<br/>Inside the ADF - a defector's story<br/>Focus on Africa podcasts<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

But that so many were equivocal will be seized upon by their political opponents.<br/>Already Labour and the Liberal Democrats are branding the prime minister as \"weak\", who has gone out of his way in the last few days to swerve questions about it all by a country mile.<br/>So ensuring there was a vote wasn't merely a way of quantifying Parliament's anger.<br/>It was also a tool to needle away at the conflict many Conservative MPs wrestle with about Boris Johnson: his role in winning the last election, perhaps helping them win their seat.

But Armenians have been here since the 4th Century, when their country was the first to adopt Christianity as a national religion. <br/>They have a share in the Old City's holiest Christian sites and their own quarter tucked away in its south-western corner, home to some 2,000 Armenians.<br/>But now the community here feels under threat because of a murky real estate deal by its own Church leaders. Amid angry protests, the Armenian patriarch has hidden himself away and a disgraced priest, who denies any wrongdoing, has fled to California. <br/>\"It's like a puzzle. I mean, we are trying to know what happened, when it happened, and how,\" explains community activist Hagop Djernazian.  <br/>What has emerged is that some 25% of the Armenian Quarter has been sold on a 99-year lease to a mysterious Jewish Australian businessman for a luxury development.  <br/>The land includes a large car parking area - one of the few areas of open land inside the Old City walls - which his company has already taken over. Many Armenians had hoped the site could be used to build affordable housing for young couples from their tiny, shrinking community. <br/>According to plans seen unofficially by Hagop and others, an Ottoman-era building housing five Armenian households, a restaurant, shops and the seminary are all part of the sell-off. Many fear this could affect the viability of living in the quarter in the long-term. <br/>But the controversy extends far more widely.  <br/>\"It is historical land that we have had for 700 years. Losing it with one signature will affect our cultural daily life, but it will also change the picture of Jerusalem,\" Hagop says. \"It will change the status quo, the entire mosaic of Jerusalem.\" <br/>As the Orthodox Easter celebrations took place in April, panic was spreading among Armenians. The Armenian Patriarch, Nourhan Manougian, admitted that he had signed away the land but said he had been deceived by a local priest who worked for him. <br/>That priest was defrocked and later there were heated scenes as he was banished from the Armenian Quarter, escorted away under Israeli police protection as residents yelled out \"traitor\".   <br/>Recently, many Armenians have been joining weekly protests, linking arms and singing nationalistic songs below the window of the patriarch who now stays cloistered in his rooms at the convent. They demand that he revokes the land deal. <br/>Amid a recent rise in attacks by extremist Jews targeting Christians in Jerusalem, some Armenians see the sale as an act of self-inflicted harm on the Christian presence here. <br/>\"The look of the city, its character is changing very much,\" says Arda, who lives in the Old City and complains that religious nationalists already feel emboldened by the drift of Israeli politics. <br/>\"Priests walking in the streets find settlers spitting at them, people say they don't want to see Christmas trees in the city, and restaurants are being attacked for no reason. It's all going in a certain direction.\" <br/>Israel captured East Jerusalem - including the Old City - from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War and went on to occupy and annex it in a move that is not recognised internationally. In the decades since, it has been at the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, claimed by both sides as their capital. Plots of land here are fiercely fought over. <br/>There is a reminder of that near to the Armenian Quarter, at Jaffa Gate - the iconic entrance to the Christian Quarter.   <br/>Here, two landmark hotels, run by Palestinians, were secretly sold to foreign firms acting as fronts for a radical Jewish settler group. The Greek Orthodox Church lost a two-decade-long battle to cancel the deal in the Israeli courts and last year settlers moved into part of one of the hotels.   <br/>Armenian elders say that in the past, there have been frequent approaches by settlers wanting to buy land in their quarter and increase the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem. The Armenian Quarter is located next to the Jewish one, which makes it especially desirable.  <br/>However, a spokesman for the settler group which bought the Jaffa Gate properties told the BBC he had no knowledge of the Armenian land sale.   <br/>Meanwhile, in interviews in the US, the cast-out priest, Baret Yeretsian, has dismissed the idea that the buyer of the land lease - named as Danny Rothman but also Daniel Rubinstein in some documents - is driven by ideology.   <br/>Nevertheless, Palestinian Christian leaders say the sale has political implications.   <br/>\"It undermines any future political solution to Jerusalem,\" says Dimitri Diliani, president of the National Christian Coalition of the Holy Land. \"According to international law, it's on occupied land that is subject to negotiations and this kind of reinforces the illegal settler presence in Palestinian East Jerusalem.\"   <br/>He believes that \"the diversity\" of Jerusalem will also be badly affected. <br/>Highlighting the significance of the Armenian Church's actions, both the Palestinian President and Jordan's King Abdullah II - custodian of Jerusalem's Christian holy sites - have suspended their recognition of the patriarch. This affects his ability to attend ceremonies and sign off on official church business.   <br/>Israel's foreign ministry has said it is aware of the Armenian patriarch's deal but due to the political sensitivity it refrains from commenting on it.  <br/>Meanwhile, in the walled courtyards of St James Convent - which has been home to many Armenian families since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and has its own clubs, school, library and even a football pitch - the talk nowadays is about little else.   <br/>Relations have been strained between the residents and clergy members, who act here as the religious and civil authority. On Friday, dozens of Armenian Jerusalemites gathered to hear from a group of international Armenian lawyers who have been visiting and have agreed to draw up recommendations on how to handle the case.<br/>Nearby, in his ceramics shop, Garo Sandrouni paints glaze onto an ornately decorated bowl wondering what the future will bring.<br/>He is from one of the families that brought the colourful tradition of Armenian pottery to Jerusalem a century ago, when they fled from what is widely seen as a genocide by the Turks.  <br/>He says that Armenians historically donated money to buy land in this holy city - their spiritual homeland - and that the Church has no right to sell it. <br/>\"This is what makes us angry. These lands belong to the Armenian nation. They don't belong to the Armenian patriarchate of Jerusalem,\" he tells me. <br/>\"The Armenian patriarchate of Jerusalem has to take care of these lands to keep them to preserve them, to protect them.\" <br/>Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The Express says rescuers are in a \"race against time\", while the Sun says the \"lost sub\" has air until Thursday.<br/>The Daily Telegraph carries a picture of Mr Harding that he posted to social media two days before the dive. Mr Harding's cousin, Kathleen Cosnett, tells the paper she was \"devastated\" to learn he was on the sub. The Times says the 58-year-old entrepreneur had posted images from the mission to the shipwreck only hours before the international rescue began. <br/>The Daily Mirror carries pictures of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and two of his predecessors, David Cameron and Boris Johnson, alongside the headline: \"Shame on you\". The page combines three stories: Mr Cameron's evidence to the Covid inquiry on the UK's pandemic preparedness, Mr Sunak's decision not to take part in the parliamentary vote on the Privileges Committee report into Boris Johnson, and the news that police may issue further fines in connection with a video showing a party at Tory HQ in December 2020. <br/>The Guardian says Conservative infighting over Boris Johnson reached a new level of intensity last night, with his supporters being told to hang their heads in shame. The paper says Mr Johnson now faces losing his parliamentary pass after what it calls a \"fractious\" debate on his conduct. <br/>The Times reports that Mr Johnson wants a \"ceasefire\" with Mr Sunak. It follows what the paper calls \"friendly fire\" in the Commons and MPs voting overwhelmingly to back the findings of the Partygate report. A source close to Mr Johnson tells the Times he wants to improve his relationship with Mr Sunak and has all but given up on making a political comeback before the next election. \"But all of this is conditional on the Sunak government leaving him alone,\" the source adds.<br/>The Financial Times warns of mounting pressure on homeowners - and a growing political risk for the government - after the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage topped 6%. According to the i, mortgage rates are set to remain high until 2025. The paper says Mr Sunak will make a speech to reassure the public that finances \"are back on track\" after a new interest rate rise is announced on Thursday. <br/>And the Daily Star leads with comments from Liz Truss, who has said a live stream set up by the paper to see if a head of lettuce could outlast her tenure in Downing Street was \"puerile\". The paper's front page labels the former prime minister a \"fun sponge\" and says that, even if she didn't find the stunt funny, the \"rest of the world\" did. <br/>Daily Express<br/>Daily Mail<br/>Daily Mirror<br/>Daily Star<br/>Daily Telegraph<br/>Financial Times<br/>Guardian<br/>Independent<br/>Metro<br/>Morning Star<br/>Sun<br/>Times<br/>The i<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

These days pilots have a lot more assistance from tech in the cockpit. <br/>Project Dragonfly, conducted on an Airbus A350-1000, extended the plane's autonomy even further.<br/>The project focused on three areas: improved automatic landing, taxi assistance and automated emergency diversion.<br/>Perhaps the last of those is the most dramatic. <br/>Malcolm Ridley, Chief Test Pilot of Airbus's commercial aircraft, reassured us that the risk of being involved in an air accident is \"vanishingly small\".<br/>However, aircraft and crew need to be ready for any scenario, so Project Dragonfly tested an automatic emergency descent system.<br/>The idea is this technology will take over if the pilots need to focus on heavy decision-making or if they were to become incapacitated. <br/>Under its own control, the plane can descend and land, while recognising other aircraft, weather and terrain.<br/>The system also allows the plane to speak to air traffic control over the radio with a synthetic voice created through the use of artificial intelligence. <br/>It is a lot for the plane's systems to take on. <br/>One of the challenges was teaching the system to understand all of the information and create a solution, says Miguel Mendes Dias, Automated Emergency Operations Designer. <br/>\"The aircraft needs to, on its own, recover all the information. So it needs to listen for the airport messages from air traffic control. <br/>\"Then it needs to choose the most suitable airport for diversion,\" he said. <br/>Project Dragonfly performed two successful emergency descents.<br/>During the test flights, French air traffic controllers fully understood the situation and the aircraft landed safely. <br/>\"It was really an amazing feat,\" says Mr Mendes.<br/>Thankfully, almost all landings are much less dramatic, and Project Dragonfly looked at the more usual kind as well. <br/>Most big airports have technology which guides the aircraft on to the runway, called Position Approach. <br/>But not every airport in the world has that tech, so Airbus has been looking at a different way to land. <br/>Project Dragonfly explored using different sensors to help an aircraft make an automated landing.<br/>It included using a combination of normal cameras, infrared and radar technology.<br/>The team also gathered data from around the world, so all sorts of weather conditions could be modelled.<br/>As well as giving the plane more information, the extra sensors give the pilot extra clarity, when monitoring the landing.<br/>For example, infrared cameras are useful in cloudy conditions, as the closer you get to objects the warmer they become. <br/>The tech \"will make the pilot comfortable in the fact that he's really aligned and on the good path to go to the runway,\" says Nuria Torres Mataboch, a computer vision engineer on the Dragonfly project.<br/>Project Dragonfly also looked at taxiing. Although this might seem like a basic task, it can be the most challenging part of the job, especially at the world's busiest airports.<br/>In this case, the pilot was in control of the aircraft.<br/>The technology provided the crew with audio alerts. So when the aircraft came across obstacles it issued an alert. It also advised pilots on speed and showed them the way to the runaway. <br/>\"We wanted something that would assist and reduce the pilots' workloads during the taxi phase,\" said Mr Ridley.<br/>What do pilots make of such developments? Some do not want the technology pushed too far. <br/>\"I don't know if any pilot is particularly comfortable with the computer being the sole arbiter of whether or not a flight successfully lands,\" said Tony Lucas, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, he is not convinced that self-flying planes will be able to deal with complex scenarios that come up.<br/>\"Automation can't replace the decision making of two well-trained and rested pilots on the flight deck,\" he said from his base at Sydney airport. <br/>Mr Lucas used the example of the Boeing 737 Max, where an automated system led to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. <br/>Airbus is quick to point out that further automation will only be introduced when safe and that the objective is not to remove pilots from the cockpit.<br/>But could passenger planes be pilot-free one day?<br/>\"Fully automated aircraft would only ever occur if that was clearly and certainly the safe way to go to protect our passengers and crew,\" says Mr Ridley.<br/>You can watch more on this story on BBC Click.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Planted on top in three strict lines are red, blue and white blooms to mirror the national flag. A patriotic flowerbed for a Russian prison.<br/>But I'm not here for the gardening. <br/>Behind these walls, Alexei Navalny - Russia's most famous prisoner and the Kremlin's most vocal critic - is about to go on trial. Again. <br/>Prison guards conduct a thorough search of our bags. Cue the sniffer dogs. <br/>Finally, we're let through. We're under strict instructions not to turn on our video camera until permitted to do so. <br/>Along with the other journalists who've made the journey here to Melekhovo, we're led into a building.<br/>We're not allowed into the hall which has been turned into a temporary courtroom. Neither are Mr Navalny's parents who are here, too. Instead, for now, we can follow proceedings on a video screen in a separate room. <br/>The signal's switched on and the picture appears. It's a wide shot of the makeshift courtroom. No close-ups. <br/>But Alexei Navalny is visible, sitting at a table with his defence lawyers. He's clearly lost a lot of weight in prison. <br/>But Mr Navalny is engaged and defiant as he rails against the judge and condemns the decision to try him here. <br/>On paper, it's a Moscow court that is hearing the case. But the trial is taking place 150 miles (240km) from the Russian capital.<br/>That suggests the Russian authorities want to avoid the publicity that transporting Mr Navalny to Moscow would inevitably bring. <br/>The picture on the screen doesn't last long. An hour and a half after the start of the trial, the prosecutor demands that proceedings are held behind closed doors. <br/>The judge rules in favour. The video feed is cut. <br/>It will now be even harder to follow what's happening to Russia's most prominent opposition leader in his trial behind bars. <br/>Jailed in 2021, Alexei Navalny is currently serving a nine-year prison term here for parole violations, fraud and contempt of court - charges widely seen as politically motivated. <br/>But that nine-year term is set to increase dramatically. <br/>In this new trial, he faces multiple charges that could add decades to his time behind bars. They include creating an extremist organisation and financing extremist activities. <br/>The authorities have already declared Mr Navalny's network of campaign offices and his Anti-Corruption Foundation \"extremist\" and shut them down. <br/>There may be worse to come. Mr Navalny says investigators told him to expect another case, another trial, this time related to terrorism charges.<br/>Why do the charges and trials keep coming? Why do the Russian authorities seem determined to pile on the pressure and keep Alexei Navalny behind bars?<br/>Over the years, Vladimir Putin's Kremlin has been busy removing all potential rivals to the president - clearing the Russian political landscape of any potential challengers. It will want to make sure that its loudest critic stays well away from Russia's political stage. <br/>For more than a decade, Alexei Navalny has exposed corruption at the heart of Russian power. His video investigations have received tens of millions of views online.<br/>But even more than this, perhaps, it is his ability to mobilise the public, especially young Russians, to take to the streets in anti-government protests which makes the authorities nervous. <br/>In recent years, he has been the only Russian opposition leader capable of organising anti-Putin street protests on a national scale. <br/>He had set up a network of regional campaign offices, having planned to run for president in 2018. He was barred from the vote.<br/>In 2020, Mr Navalny was poisoned in Siberia by what Western laboratories later confirmed to be a nerve agent. <br/>He accused the Kremlin of trying to kill him. The Russian authorities deny that. <br/>After receiving urgent medical care in Germany, his decision to return to Russia in 2021 will have been viewed by those in power here as a direct challenge to the Kremlin.

while 118 Tories voted in favour. <br/>No vote was recorded for 225 MPs, because they either abstained or did not turn up to vote. <br/>Mr Johnson had asked his supporters not to vote against the report, with sources close to the former prime minister arguing it had no practical effect now he has resigned. <br/>But his critics suggested the move was designed to avoid revealing the low level of support for him among Tory MPs. <br/>Some abstained, while others did not turn up to vote at all. <br/>Johnson allies who spoke in the debate but did not vote include Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg and Lia Nici. <br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak did not attend the debate and has refused to say how he would have voted, suggesting he did not want to influence others. <br/>Senior Conservative Tobias Ellwood, who voted to back the report, said it was a \"highly symbolic\" day as Parliament sought to \"bring to a conclusion a very difficult chapter in British politics\". <br/>He said that because Mr Johnson had already \"walked\", many MPs, including him, had not initially appreciated the wider public's high expectations for Parliament to not just rubber stamp this report but thoroughly debate its findings, given it related to rules set by the government.<br/>\"This was the collective conscience of Parliament, if you like, being judged by the British people,\" he said.<br/>The Liberal Democrats accused Mr Sunak of \"a cowardly cop-out\". <br/>The party's deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"His failure to vote says all you need to know about this prime minister's lack of leadership.\"<br/>A Labour Party spokesperson said Mr Sunak was \"too weak to lead a party too divided to govern\". <br/>The vote means Mr Johnson loses his right to a parliamentary pass, which gives access to certain parts of Parliament, as this was one of the report's recommendations. <br/>The Privileges Committee of MPs, which has a Conservative majority, was asked to investigate whether Mr Johnson had misled MPs over what he knew about parties held in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns - dubbed the Partygate scandal. <br/>Its report concluded that Mr Johnson made multiple deliberately misleading statements to Parliament about events at No 10. <br/>Ahead of the report's publication, Mr Johnson announced he was quitting as an MP, branding the committee a \"kangaroo court\". <br/>The report found Mr Johnson had committed further \"contempts\" of Parliament by attacking the committee, increasing the severity of the recommended sanction. <br/>The committee subsequently recommended a 90-day suspension for Mr Johnson - a long ban by recent standards - as well as denying him the parliamentary pass, which he would normally be entitled to as a former MP. <br/>If he had still been an MP, the suspension could have triggered a by-election in his constituency. <br/>Speaking during a Commons debate ahead of the vote, Mrs May said backing the report would be \"a small but important step in restoring people's trust\" in Parliament.<br/>It was \"important to show the public that there is not one rule for them and another for us\", she said. <br/>Mrs May urged her fellow MPs to vote in support of the report \"to uphold standards in public life, to show that we all recognise the responsibility we have to the people we serve, and to help to restore faith in our parliamentary democracy\". <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rishi Sunak is asked several times if he will take part in Boris Johnson Partygate report debate and vote in the Commons.<br/>During the debate, supporters of Mr Johnson spoke out against the report's findings. <br/>Ms Nici, who was Mr Johnson's parliamentary private secretary, told MPs she could not see any evidence he had knowingly misled Parliament. <br/>She questioned the impartiality of the committee and suggested the process was \"political opportunism\" for people who did not like Mr Johnson. <br/>Former minister Sir Jacob, who was knighted by Mr Johnson in his resignation honours, described the proposed 90-day suspension as \"a vindictive sanction\". <br/>In response to accusations some Johnson allies had attempted to discredit the committee's work, Mr Rees-Mogg said it was \"absolutely legitimate to criticise the conduct of a committee\" and its members. <br/>However, the committee's chairwoman, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said its members had to \"withstand a campaign of threats, intimidation, and harassment designed to challenge the legitimacy of the inquiry\". <br/>She defended her impartiality, after Sir Jacob referenced her previous tweets criticising Mr Johnson, saying she had offered to step aside as chairwoman after the tweets emerged but she said she was assured by the government she should continue in her role. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Harriet Harman answers Jacob Rees-Mogg who raises her \"famous tweets\" about Boris Johnson<br/>Earlier it was not clear whether there would be a formal vote on the report - compelling MPs to go on the record to either vote for, against or abstain - but Labour forced one. <br/>It was a free vote for Tory MPs, meaning party managers - known as whips - had not instructed them how to vote. <br/>Commons Leader Ms Mordaunt, who opened the debate, said she would vote in support of the report, adding: \"The integrity of our institutions matter.\"<br/>However, she said \"all members need to make up their own minds and others should leave them alone to do so\". <br/>Sunak not expected to attend Partygate debate<br/>Tory MPs face dilemma on Johnson Partygate vote<br/>Boris Johnson Partygate report at a glance<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

She described the findings as \"quite novel and quite exciting\".<br/>Napping has been shown to be critical for development when we are babies, becomes less common as we age and then goes through a resurgence in popularity after retirement, with 27% of people over 65 reporting having a daytime nap. <br/>Dr Garfield says advice to nap is \"something quite easy\" to do in comparison to weight loss or exercise which are \"difficult for a lot of people\".<br/>The brain naturally shrinks with age, but whether naps could help prevent diseases like Alzheimer's will still need extra research. <br/>Overall brain health is important for protecting against dementia and the condition is linked to disturbed sleep.<br/>The researchers suggest poor sleep is damaging the brain over time by causing inflammation and affecting the connections between brain cells. <br/>\"Thus, regular napping could protect against neurodegeneration by compensating for deficient sleep,\" researcher Valentina Paz said.<br/>However, Dr Garfield is not about to find a comfy spot to snooze at work and prefers other ways of looking after her brain.<br/>\"Honestly, I would rather spend 30\u00a0minutes exercising than napping, I'll probably try and recommend that my mum does it.\" <br/>Studying napping can be a challenge. <br/>Napping might boost health, but the reverse is also true as your health can leave you so tired you need to nap more. <br/>So the researchers used a clever technique to prove that napping is beneficial. <br/>They used a gigantic natural experiment based on the DNA - the genetic code -  with which we are born. Previous studies have identified 97 snippets of our DNA that either make us more likely to be nappers or to power through the day. <br/>So the team took data from 35,000 people, aged 40 to 69, taking part in the UK Biobank project and simply compared those genetic \"nappers\" and \"non-nappers\".<br/>The results, published in the journal Sleep Health, showed a 15 cubic centimetre difference - equivalent to 2.6 to 6.5 years of ageing. Total brain volumes were about 1,480 cubic centimetres in the study. <br/>\"I enjoy short naps on the weekends and this study has convinced me that I shouldn't feel lazy napping, it may even be protecting my brain,\" Prof Tara Spires-Jones, from the University of Edinburgh and the president of the British Neuroscience Association, told me.<br/>She said the \"interesting\" findings study showed a \"small but significant increase in brain volume\" and \"adds to the data indicating that sleep is important for brain health\".<br/>The researchers did not directly study having a big sleep in the middle of the day, but said the science pointed towards a cut off of half an hour. <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Southeast Asian economies sitting on crucial global supply routes, and tiny Pacific island nations, pulled between Chinese and American overtures, would have been just as reassured. <br/>\"Everyone is learning to live with China-US rivalry, but no-one wants to choose between them,\" says John Delury, Professor of Chinese Studies at Seoul's Yonsei University. \"There will be some relief to see these two countries acting like grown-ups.\"  <br/>That certainly seemed to be the message both sides sought to send. Over two days, Mr Blinken met China's top diplomats Wang Yi and Qin Gang - the latter for several hours, including a \"working dinner\" - before finally sitting down with Mr Xi in the Great Hall of The People. <br/>By the end of it Mr Xi hailed \"progress\" in the talks and spoke of \"agreements on specific issues\", without saying what those were. Back in Washington DC, Mr Biden praised Mr Blinken for doing \"a hell of a job\". But the 61-year-old secretary of state, ever the pragmatic diplomat, told reporters that he was \"clear-eyed\" about China. He welcomed the reopening of high-level communication, and said the Chinese agreed with the Americans that ties must stabilise, but he also admitted that there were \"many issues on which we profoundly - even vehemently - disagree\".<br/>And yet the lacklustre readouts, with no breakthroughs and plenty of qualifiers, have been greeted with hope, rather than disappointment. That's how low expectations were. <br/>Relations between Washington and Beijing have been so fraught that the Americans came hoping to avert a conflict, a growing risk that has alarmed the region. <br/>A recent survey by the Eurasia Group Foundation suggests that more than 90% of the respondents in South Korea, the Philippines and Singapore are \"worried\" about a confrontation between the two superpowers. Almost half of those asked chose regional tensions as the most pressing challenge facing their country. <br/>\"The world does not want to see this relationship spiral out of control,\" said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific Program. \"There has been anxiety in the region and beyond that the US and China were not talking - countries want to know that if there were to be an accident, the two sides could avoid escalation.\"<br/>This is no longer playground politics. It has even gone well beyond concerns about global trade and semiconductor supplies. It has become a battle for influence that is forcing countries in the region to make tough choices about their own security.<br/>South Korea and Japan have been American allies for decades, but historical grievances have kept them apart. Now Beijing's growing assertiveness, coupled with North Korea's record missile launches, has produced a necessary thaw as they face the same escalating threats.<br/>Driven by a similar urgency, the Philippines has allowed the US access to more military bases. Tokyo is also reportedly preparing military aid for Manila - a move that could bring the Japanese back to Philippine shores for the first time since World War Two.<br/>The ripples go as far as the Pacific Islands, where the US and China are trying to gain a strategic foothold. Washington signed a new security pact with Papua New Guinea in May after Beijing did the same with the Solomon Islands.<br/>What many of these countries would most like to see is the resumption of a military hotline between Beijing and the Pentagon. Mr Blinken pushed for this in his meetings, but the Chinese, it seems, did not agree. <br/>The region is particularly on edge that the two could clash militarily over the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own. <br/>With increased military presence in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, the risk of a miscalculation is higher than ever, especially as the US and China skirt close enough in the sky, and in the waters below.<br/>\"We need reliable communication channels. We need to reduce the risk of a military accident,\" Ms Glaser said.<br/>For countries in the Asia-Pacific, the meeting is only a start, and a tentative one at that. But, for now, they will take any amount of progress that is possible. Even if all that means is being able to take breath.<br/>\"This visit doesn't guarantee anything, but it at least shows the US and China trying to defuse tensions and maintain dialogue, which is a good look in this part of the world,\" Mr Delury said.<br/>But the biggest challenge still lies ahead. Beijing has made it clear that Taiwan lies at the \"core\" of their interests. So the question is what happens next between the world's two largest economies - and nuclear powers? <br/>The problem for Washington is the clock is ticking as another election looms. President Biden's Republican rivals have accused him of being soft on China. He may be tempted to show he can stand up to Mr Xi rather than alongside him. <br/>\"If the relationship is to be stabilised,\" Ms Glaser says, \"It has be now.\"<br/>US and China pledge to stabilise tense relations<br/>Hostages no more: G7 takes stand against China<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

They were ordered to suspend their practice for six months, and were fined 1.4m Taiwanese dollars (\u00a335,989, $46,121).<br/>Amid growing public concern, Taipei City Hospital has also begun offering free blood tests for preschool children to check for traces of sedatives.<br/>The measures come after the scandal first emerged in May, when parents at a private preschool in New Taipei City accused staff of feeding their children \"unknown drugs\".<br/>Mike, a father of a five-year-old child, told BBC Chinese that parents had noticed what appeared to be withdrawal symptoms in their children over the long Lunar New Year holiday period in February.<br/>\"Some parents found their children, over the vacation, had become irritable, restless and screamed when sleeping, and even cried out with leg cramps,\" he said.<br/>After speaking to the children, parents learnt that their teachers had fed them an \"unknown potion\". Complaints were filed with police in April and May.<br/>Following more complaints from parents in June, local authorities launched an investigation, and found at least eight children with trace amounts of phenobarbital and benzodiazepines - a class of psychoactive drugs - in their system. <br/>The kindergarten at the centre of the controversy, a franchise of the Kid Castle Educational Institute, was ordered to shut down on 12 June. Its directors have been fined 150,000 Taiwanese dollars(\u00a33,800 $4,872).<br/>The principal and five teachers were arrested and questioned by police but have since been released on bail. A criminal investigation is underway. <br/>Local media reported that the staff said the parents had consented to a list of medicine provided by the school but some parents in response questioned the medicines used by the school.<br/>A Taiwanese pharmacist told local media that, although rare, some cough and gastrointestinal medicine contain phenobarbital.  <br/>Drugs containing phenobarbital are mostly used in the treatment of epilepsy and or used as surgical anaesthesia, and are difficult to obtain. <br/>Benzodiazepines are a class of depressant drugs most commonly used to treat severe anxiety.<br/>The drugs are highly addictive, and overdose may lead to drowsiness and shortness of breath. <br/>China and Taiwan: A really simple guide<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

I took that option as I wasn't just doing it for myself. <br/>\"After donating I started to feel quite guilty. I wasn't sure that I had done the right thing. What if the mother of the child isn't a good one? What if the child ends up in foster care? What if it's neglected? <br/>\"Fast forward a few years, I found out that a baby girl was born in December 2011 from my donation. Finding out a child was born made those guilty feelings go away,\" she said.<br/>Ms Henry went on to have her own children with a new partner, and never used her frozen eggs, which have now been disposed of.<br/>\"I fell pregnant naturally and quite quickly and had my first daughter at age 39 and I am currently on maternity leave again having had my son last December, aged 44,\" she said.<br/>\"This will be an ongoing conversation with my two children that they have a genetic sister out there in the world. I pray that I will see this child one day. It is one of my last wishes.\"<br/>TV presenter and podcaster Vicky Pattison, who also lives in Essex, has just had some of her eggs frozen, after deciding she was not yet ready for children.  <br/>Three of her eggs were turned into embryos with her partner's sperm, which she was told have a 20% chance of resulting in a baby. She has also kept three as unfertilised eggs, which have a 10% chance.<br/>She shared her feelings throughout the treatment, saying there was \"not enough genuine, honest information out there\".<br/>Success is strongly dependent on the age of the woman at the time of freezing her eggs, the HFEA said, with higher success rates in those aged under 35.<br/>Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Bassel Wattar said more work was needed to inform patients and support them through their fertility journey.<br/>\"Unfortunately, there is limited public awareness on the pros and cons of this treatment and how it could be best planned to optimise chances of starting a family in the future,\" he said.<br/>Are you freezing your eggs?

As we continue to pump vast quantities of planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere we are driving up global temperatures.<br/>But other factors are likely also playing a role.<br/>Professor Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, says weaker than average winds have reduced the amount of dust from the Sahara Desert in the atmosphere. <br/>Saharan dust blocks and reflects some of the sun's energy out of the atmosphere, moderating sea temperatures.<br/>The trade winds have been unusually light this year and, at the same time, a persistent weather pattern with easterly winds from the continental US may also have helped warm the sea surface.<br/>Another factor could be the effects of a reduction in pollution from shipping.<br/>Regulations reducing the sulphur content of fuel burned by ships were brought in by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2020.<br/>This significantly reduces the amount of aerosol particles released into the atmosphere, the IMO says. <br/>But aerosols that pollute the air can also help reflect heat back into space, so removing them may have caused more heat to enter the waters. <br/>It looks like the impacts of the exceptional temperatures in the North Atlantic are already beginning to be felt.<br/>The eastern tropical Atlantic is the main spawning ground for North Atlantic hurricanes and the Met Office says an Atlantic tropical storm looks likely to form east of the Caribbean by the middle of this week. <br/>Julian Heming, a tropical cyclone expert at the Met Office, says it is very unusual to see a storm developing in that area so early in the season.<br/>Hurricane development is normally supressed during El Ni\u00f1o periods, but the Met Office's forecast suggests an above average season for tropical storms and cyclones in the North Atlantic basin this year because of the high surface temperatures.<br/>The Met Office says we can expect the hot weather to continue.<br/>It says there is a 45% chance - significantly higher than usual - that the UK will have what it describes as a \"hot summer\".<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

including the longest time spent at full ocean depth during a dive to the deepest part of the Mariana Trench.<br/>Over the weekend, Mr Harding said on social media that a ship had set off from the city of St John's, in Newfoundland, Canada, for the destination of the Titanic wreck. <br/>From there, he and the crew were planning to start diving operations in the submersible down to the wreck at around 04:00 local time (08:00 GMT) on Sunday morning. <br/>He wrote on Facebook that he was \"proud to finally announce\" that he would be aboard the mission to the wreck of the Titanic.<br/>Due to the \"worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years,\" he said \"this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023\".<br/>He continued: \"A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow.\"<br/>Action Aviation said on Sunday that the sub had had a successful launch and Mr Harding was \"currently diving\".<br/>Later, his stepson Brian Szasz said in a now-deleted post on Facebook: He \"has gone missing on (the) submarine.\"<br/>Patrick Woodhead, founder of British tour operator White Desert Antarctica, said Mr Harding was an \"incredible\" aviation explorer and great advocate for discovering new pathways to make the world a better place.<br/>Mr Harding had travelled with them to Antarctica a number of times, he said, including with US astronaut Buzz Aldrin. <br/>Thoughts and prayers were with Mr Harding's wife, Linda, and his sons, he added.<br/>In a statement released on Tuesday, the Dawood family in Pakistan said: \"Our son Shahzada Dawood and his son, Suleman, had embarked on a journey to visit the remnants of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean. <br/>\"As of now, contact has been lost with their submersible craft and there is limited information available.\"<br/>It is understood the Dawood family, who live in Surbiton, south-west London, are in Canada for a month, according to PA News.<br/>Shahzada Dawood, from one of Pakistan's richest families, is a trustee of the Seti Institute, a research organisation in California, according to its website. <br/>It says he lives in the UK with his wife, Christine, and his children Suleman and Alina, and is in the Founder's Circle of the British Asian Trust.<br/>He is also vice chairman of Dawood Hercules Corporation, part of the Dawood Group, a conglomerate of various businesses owned by the family.<br/>In their statement, his parents said: \"We are very grateful for the concern being shown by our colleagues and friends and would like to request everyone to pray for their safety.\"<br/>It went on to say the family was well looked after and were praying for the safe return of their family members.<br/>Military planes, a submarine and sonar buoys have so far been used in the search for the vessel.<br/>Titanic's wreck lies some 435 miles (700km) south of St John's, Newfoundland, though the rescue mission is being run from Boston, Massachusetts.<br/>The US Coast Guard said a research ship called the Polar Prince had conducted a surface search for the sub on Monday evening. <br/>It is used to transport submersibles to the wreckage site and was the support ship on Sunday's tourist expedition.<br/>In relation to an inquiry about Mr Harding, a spokesperson from the UK's Foreign Office said it was \"in contact with the family of a British man following reports of a missing submarine off the coast of North America.\"<br/>The eight-day trip involving a journey to the wreck of the Titanic -

A Facebook post from Hamish Harding, who was on the Titan, said they expected to start the dive in the submersible at 04:00 local time. <br/>The Boston Coast Guard, which is leading the search operation, said on Twitter that the five person crew \"submerged Sunday morning, and the crew of the Polar Prince lost contact with them approximately one hour and 45 minutes into the vessel's dive\". <br/>The Titan submersible was thought to be approximately 900 miles (1450km) off the coast of Cape Cod at the time.<br/>The US Coast Guard's Rear Admiral John Mauger said on Monday that it is a challenge to conduct a search in such a remote area. <br/>The search has two aspects, he said. These are a surface search in case the Titan has returned to the ocean's surface but somehow lost communications, and an underwater sonar search. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Titanic tourist sub search 'a challenge' - Rear Adm John Mauger <br/>The Coast Guard has sent two C-130 Hercules aircraft to search for the submersible on the surface of the water, and has been joined by a Canadian C-130, and a P8 aircraft equipped with underwater sonar capability. Sonar buoys are also being deployed in the area. <br/>Rear Adm John Mauger of the US Coast Guard said it would need additional expertise to rescue the vessel if it was found underwater and he was reaching out for help, including to the US Navy and the private sector. <br/>Canada's defence department said that, along with the aircraft, the Canadian coast guard vessel Kopit Hopson was assisting in the search. <br/>Horizon Maritime, which co-owns the Polar Prince, confirmed to the BBC that vessel is helping and a second vessel, the Horizon Arctic, has been sent to the site. <br/>Among the five people on board the Titan, three people so far have been confirmed - Hamish Harding, a 58-year-old British businessman and explorer, and a Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son, Suleman Dawood. <br/>Mr Harding first announced he was joining the team in June last year, and said that the crew on the vessel includes \"a couple of legendary explorers, some of which have done over 30 dives to the RMS Titanic since the 1980s\".<br/>Mr Harding is the chairman of Action Aviation, an international company which deals with sales and operations in the business aviation industry, based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.<br/>On Twitter, his firm said on Sunday that \"the sub had a successful launch and Hamish is currently diving\". <br/>In a statement on Tuesday, the Dawood family said: \"Our son Shahzada Dawood and his son, Suleman, had embarked on a journey to visit the remnants of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean. <br/>\"As of now, contact has been lost with their submersible craft and there is limited information available. <br/>\"We are very grateful for the concern being shown by our colleagues and friends and would like to request everyone to pray for their safety while granting the family privacy at this time.\"<br/>French explorer Paul-Henry Nargeolet is also thought to be on board, according to a Facebook post by Mr Harding before the dive started<br/>And Stockton Rush, chief executive of OceanGate - the firm behind the dive - is also being widely reported to be on the vessel.<br/>OceanGate Expeditions charges guests $250,000 (\u00a3195,270) for a place on its eight-day expedition to see the famous wreck, which sits 3,800m (12,500ft) beneath the surface at the bottom of the Atlantic. <br/>The site is about 600km (370 miles) off the coast of Newfoundland, and lies in two parts, with the bow and the stern separated by about 800m (2,600ft). A huge debris field surrounds the broken vessel.<br/>A full dive to the wreck, including the descent and ascent, reportedly takes eight hours.<br/>Each expedition lasts eight days, according to OceanGate, and each dive is meant to include a scientific objective, including studying the wreck's decay. <br/>The inaugural dive took place in 2021, according to the company's website. <br/>Submarine expert Prof Alistair Greig from University College London has worked through a number of scenarios for where the missing submersible might be, he told BBC Science Correspondent Pallab Ghosh.<br/>One is that it released a \"drop weight\" after an emergency, in order to bring it to the surface.<br/>\"If there was a power failure and/or communication failure, this might have happened, and the submersible would then be bobbing about on the surface waiting to be found,\" he said.<br/>Another scenario, he says, is that the hull was compromised resulting in a leak. \"Then the prognosis is not good.\"<br/>If it has gone down to the seabed and can't get back up under its own power, the options - according to Prof Greig - are very limited.<br/>\"While the submersible might still be intact, if it is deeper than more than 200m (656ft) there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers. The vehicles designed for navy submarine rescue certainly can't get down to anywhere near the depth of the Titanic.\"<br/>The Titan is a five-person submersible built to descend to depths of 4,000 metres (2.5 miles) and travels at three knots - that's about 3.5 miles per hour.<br/>Aside from taking divers to the wreck of the Titanic, it's used for site survey and inspection, research and data collection, film and media production, and deep sea testing of hardware and software.<br/>According to the company, the Titan is \"outfitted with state-of-the-art lighting and sonar navigation systems plus internally and externally mounted 4K video and photographic equipment\". <br/>According to OceanGate's website, the five-person sub has system for monitoring the vessel's hull in real time.<br/>It has sensors to analyse the effects of changing pressure on the sub as it dives, in order to assess the integrity of the structure.<br/>\"This onboard health analysis monitoring system provides early warning detection for the pilot with enough time to arrest the descent and safely return to surface,\" the company says. <br/>The BBC's US partner CBS sent one of its reporters on a voyage with the same company last year to see the wreck of the Titanic.<br/>David Pogue, who went on board, reported that he read a waiver that described the submersible as an \"experimental\" vessel, \"that has not been approved or certified by any regulatory body, and could result in physical injury, disability, emotional trauma or death\".<br/>OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush then gave him a tour of the submersible, where he revealed the vessel only has one button and is run using a video game controller.<br/>What questions do you have about what's happened?

Clearly those are no longer getting a response,\" Mr Pogue said, adding that Titan had got lost for about three hours during the expedition he was on last year. <br/>He described being initially hesitant about going aboard the sub at all because some of the components appeared \"off the shelf, sort of improvised\". <br/>\"You steer this sub with an Xbox game controller, some of the ballast is abandoned construction pipes.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Mike went to see the Titanic before and says we're all aware of the risks, it's not a lark<br/>Mr Pogue said he had been reassured by Titan's inventor and Stockton Rush, the chief executive of OceanGate, that the carbon-fibre main capsule had been co-designed with Nasa and the University of Washington and was \"rock solid\". <br/>Mr Reiss said that the Titan is \"a beautifully designed craft\" but that problems can arise due to the nature of the expedition.<br/>\"This is not to say this is a shoddy ship or anything, it's just that this is all new technology and they're learning it as they go along. <br/>\"You have to just remember the early days of the space programme or the early days of aviation, where you just make a lot of mistakes on the way to figuring out what you're doing.\"<br/>Titanic's wreck lies some 435 miles (700km) south of St John's, Newfoundland, though the rescue mission is being run from Boston, Massachusetts.<br/>Among those aboard the submersible is the British billionaire businessman and explorer Hamish Harding, according to his family. <br/>Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son, Suleman, were also on board, their family said in a statement.<br/>French explorer Paul-Henry Nargeolet is thought to be on board, according to a Facebook post by Mr Harding before the dive started<br/>Mr Rush, the head of OceanGate is also being widely reported to be on the vessel.<br/>In a statement on Monday, OceanGate said its \"entire focus [was] on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families\".<br/>The company added that it was \"deeply thankful\" for the \"extensive assistance\" it had been given from government agencies and companies involved in deep sea operations.<br/>The Titanic, which was the largest ship of its time, hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912. Of the 2,200 passengers and crew onboard, more than 1,500 died.<br/>Its wreckage has been extensively explored since it was discovered in 1985.<br/>Missing Titanic sub may have 70 hours of oxygen left<br/>Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Watch the BBC's Lora Jones tell you, in a minute.<br/>In England a holding deposit is paid to a landlord to reserve a property.<br/>It can't be more than one week's rent.<br/>You should get the money back within seven days of signing your tenancy agreement - or it can go towards your rent.<br/>But if you decide not to move in, you could lose it. <br/>If the landlord doesn't give it back, and you think they should, write to them.<br/>If you still don't get a refund, contact one of the letting agents redress schemes.<br/>You can also complain in England to Trading Standards through the Citizen's Advice consumer helpline.<br/>Such deposits are not legal in Scotland, and rules are different in Wales and Northern Ireland.<br/>Landlords need to follow strict rules if they want a tenant to leave - if not, the eviction could be illegal, or the landlord could be guilty of harassment.<br/>In England the landlord has to give written notice to the tenant, which could be: <br/>Other tenancy contracts have different rules.<br/>Once the notice period ends, the landlord can start eviction proceedings through court.<br/>Landlords can apply for a so-called \"possession order\". If that is granted and you don't leave, landlords can apply for a \"warrant for possession\".<br/>Rules differ in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. <br/>Tenants in England have the right to \"live in a property that's safe and in a good state of repair\". Similar rules are in place in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.<br/>Landlords are not expected to do small jobs like changing light bulbs.<br/>However, a rented home could be unfit if, for example, the electrics are unsafe, it's damp, or there's a problem with rats or mice.<br/>If so, you can complain to your landlord, or - if that doesn't work - your local council.<br/>Your landlord may try to evict you rather than make repairs, but you might have more protection if you've already complained to the council. <br/>Tenants need to pay rent on time, cover the bills they are responsible for, and look after the property. This includes disposing of rubbish, and keeping the property reasonably clean.<br/>Under a new law tabled in Parliament, tenants will be given a legal right to request to keep a pet, which the landlord can't unreasonably refuse.<br/>The law is also set to make it illegal for a landlord to refuse tenancies to families with children, or those on benefits.<br/>At presentit could be discrimination under equality law in England if a landlord refuses to rent a property to a woman because she has children.<br/>Before you complain, you need to be able to show you can afford the rent, and that the property is a suitable size, Shelter says.<br/>Landlords should not issue blanket bans on pets, and must give a good reason to refuse them - for example, the property is too small.<br/>However, they can charge a higher rent to cover the risk of pet damage.<br/>Landlords can choose to include bills such as council tax, but don't have to.<br/>If a landlord includes utility bills, they cannot charge more than they are paying. <br/>Exhausting, costly, miserable: My search to rent a one-bed flat<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The last year has been one of considerable upheaval in the sector, after many years of ultra-low rates.<br/>The interest charged on fixed rates for new borrowers peaked after last autumn's mini-budget, then calmed somewhat, but has risen again during the early summer.<br/>That's because wages and prices look like they are rising faster and for longer than thought, and so the Bank of England could keep raising the base rate to 5.5% or more. It is currently 4.5%.<br/>If the base rate does rise again, anyone on tracker deals will face higher repayments.<br/>House prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers.<br/>The government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggested that UK house prices will fall by 10% by 2024 compared with last year's peak.<br/>There are still plenty of options depending on your circumstances. However, it is more a question of whether people can afford higher repayments.<br/>An agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage, without a new affordability test, when their current deal ends, as long as they are up to date with payments.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice.

Savings could also be put into a linked offset savings account, in which you only pay interest on the mortgage amount, minus the amount you've saved.<br/>Some borrowers want to extend the length of the mortgage term, although that would mean paying more in total, for longer.<br/>A broker can guide you through the different options.<br/>A shortfall equivalent to two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears.<br/>But your lender must make reasonable attempts to reach an agreement with you.<br/>In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates mortgage lenders, has said they must treat customers fairly.<br/>Crucially, customers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they are going to struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must be on hand to help.<br/>Within 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must:<br/>Your lender must then treat you fairly by considering any requests about changing how you pay, perhaps with lower repayments for a short period.<br/>Any arrangement you come to, the FCA points out, will be reflected on your credit file - affecting your ability to borrow money in the future - as will any missed payments.<br/>Your lender might also suggest or allow you to extend the term of the mortgage or let you pay just the interest for a certain period of time.<br/>A mortgage payment holiday enables customers to delay repayments - but not indefinitely.<br/>Lenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances - and not to those already in arrears - but the level of support offered during the Covid pandemic has been reduced.<br/>Again, this will show on your credit file. <br/>Some people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it.<br/>Repossessions are far rarer than they used to be.<br/>There are lots of stages before a lender can take such action and the whole process takes about two years.<br/>But if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice.<br/>Governments tend not to get directly involved in support when people face higher mortgage repayments.<br/>For people on qualifying benefits, Support for Mortgage Interest is available across the UK. The government pays some of your mortgage interest payments, but only in the form of a loan (which has its own interest rate).<br/>Borrowers tend to pay off the loan when they sell the property, or when they die.<br/>There are various conditions and requirements that need to be considered before signing up.<br/>The devolved governments run some mortgage support schemes, but the criteria can be complex and they tend to be when people are at risk of homelessness.

At the same time, the war in Ukraine meant less was available from Russia, putting further pressure on prices.<br/>The war has also reduced the amount of grain available, pushing up global food prices. <br/>This effect was compounded in the UK in February by a shortage of salad and other vegetables, which took food inflation to a 45-year high.<br/> Alcohol prices in restaurants and pubs also rose. <br/>Your device may not support this visualisation<br/>Pay increases for many people aren't keeping up with rising prices.<br/>The average weekly salary in the UK, excluding bonuses, was \u00a3603 in April, up from \u00a3598 in March, according to official figures.<br/>Throughout 2022, the average salary rose by nearly \u00a33 a month.<br/>But when you take inflation into account, the average salary actually fell by 1.3% in the three months to April, compared with the same period the year before. <br/>Unions say wages should reflect the cost of living and many workers have been striking over pay. <br/>However, the government argues big pay rises could push inflation higher because companies might increase prices as a result. <br/>The Bank of England has a target to keep inflation at 2%, but the current rate is still more than five times that. <br/>Its traditional response to rising inflation is to put up interest rates. <br/>This makes borrowing more expensive, and can mean some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. Some saving rates also increase. <br/>When people have less money to spend, they buy fewer things, reducing the demand for goods and slowing price rises.<br/>Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs, and may cut staff. <br/>In May, the Bank increased interest rates for the 12th time in a row, taking the main rate to 4.5%. <br/>The next interest rate announcement is on 22 June.<br/>But when inflation is caused by factors such as global energy prices, action from the Bank of England may not be enough to slow it down. <br/>Lower inflation does not mean prices fall. It just means they stop rising as quickly.<br/>Announcing its latest interest-rate decision, the bank said inflation would \"fall sharply in April\" - those figures have yet to be released - but not as far or as fast as it had previously thought. <br/>It says inflation is now expected to drop to 5% by the end of 2023, rather than the 4% previously predicted.<br/>The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which assesses the government's economic plans, had previously predicted inflation would fall back to 2.9% by the end of the year.<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said halving inflation by the end of 2023 is one of the government's five key pledges. <br/>Other countries are also experiencing a cost-of-living squeeze.<br/>Many of the reasons are the same - increased energy costs, shortages of goods and materials and the fallout from Covid.<br/>The annual inflation rate for countries which use the euro is estimated to be 6.1% for May, down from 7% in April.<br/>Inflation has been falling in the US too. It was 4% in the 12 months to May, down from 4.9% in April, the 11th consecutive monthly drop. <br/>In response, the US central bank has increased its key interest rate to 5.25%, up from near 0% a year ago - and the highest level since 2007. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It is not only anxious homeowners - tenants are worried their landlords, facing higher rates of their own, will put up their rent.<br/>Here are five reasons for the current commotion.<br/>If forecasts were to be believed, we should be seeing a significant slowdown in price rises. The rate of inflation shows the pace at which prices are going up, and so charts the rising cost of living.<br/>The latest official data spooked markets and lenders though, as it suggested inflation was going to stay higher for longer than anticipated. It also pointed to a theory that higher prices were becoming more embedded in the UK economy.<br/>The premier, if rather blunt, tool to tackle high inflation is for the Bank of England to put up interest rates. With the benchmark rate now expected to peak at 5.5%, rather than the current 4.5%, the cost to lenders would be greater, and so - in turn - they have put up the interest rate they charge for mortgages.<br/>Mohamed El-Erian, former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and president of Queens' College at Cambridge University, says the blame lies with central banks who suggested high inflation would only be temporary. <br/>\"It turned out inflation was persistent and therefore central banks were late and society as a whole was late to adjust to higher inflation,\" he told the BBC.<br/>Two years ago there was a rush from property buyers as tax concessions from ministers to keep the housing market moving during Covid were wound down.<br/>Lower or zero rates on stamp duty, and the equivalent tax in Scotland and Wales, made \"a hot market even hotter\", according to analysts. The pandemic led many people to reconsider where they lived, and stamp duty cuts made them move more quickly.<br/>Many of those buyers got two-year fixed mortgages, which are now due to expire.<br/>The peak for homeowners rolling off fixed mortgage deals is July to October this year, with more than 400,000 expected to do so, according to figures from the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. <br/>The timing isn't great. The rates being offered for a new deal now are considerably higher than back then. That could add hundreds of pounds to a monthly mortgage repayment.<br/>Anil and Jessica Jhamat, from Solihull, are having to find an extra \u00a3550 a month. They bought their home during the stamp duty holiday, which allowed them to purchase \"a house we wouldn't otherwise have been able to afford\".  <br/>\"We assumed interest rates would stay low, otherwise we'd have taken out a five-year fix,\" Mr Jhamat said. \"Hindsight is a wonderful thing.\"<br/>The pharmacist and his wife, a digital manager, also have to find \u00a31,000 a month in childcare fees for their one-year-old son. \"Where we are now, we've lost what we saved [in stamp duty]. Essentially we're back to square one,\" he said.<br/>A mortgage repayment is the highest monthly outgoing for many people, so decisions over which product to choose are made with lots of thought and advice.<br/>The trouble is lenders are currently withdrawing their mortgage products with hardly any notice. That makes for a frenzied situation.<br/>On Thursday, HSBC gave notice to brokers that it was going to pull its deals four hours later. After being inundated with applications, it withdrew them within three hours, only to then temporarily reopen the channel for applications on Friday. <br/>At times like this, big lenders do not want their deals to be significantly cheaper than their rivals, and they only want as many applications as they can cope with.<br/>Justin Moy, founder at Chelmsford-based mortgage broker EHF Mortgages, said: \"These last-minute communications just add to the stress of the situation. Decisions on rate changes and repricing must give everyone the opportunity to react in a controlled manner, especially when the increases are hefty and make a real difference to a borrower.\"<br/>Homeowners who decide the best thing to do is sit on their hands and wait for things to settle down could face a nasty shock.<br/>When a fixed term comes to an end - usually after two or five years - then a borrower reverts automatically to their lender's standard variable rate (SVR). That rate is higher, which is why most people go on to another fixed deal instead, although not everyone has that option as, for example, they may have missed payments in the past.<br/>Brokers say these SVRs have soared, meaning anyone who adopts a wait and see approach would see a massive jump in the rate they pay, and therefore a much higher monthly mortgage bill.<br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice. It is based on a standard mortgage repayment formula based on the mortgage size and length and a fixed interest rate. It should be used as a guide only and does not represent the suitability, eligibility or availability of mortgage offers for users. For exact figures, users will need to approach an official mortgage lender.<br/>Interest rates fluctuate based on the Bank of England's base rate and market conditions.<br/>\"Some lenders have a much higher SVR than others. We tell our clients how important it is to choose a lender that treats its customers fairly when their rates come to an end,\" says Aaron Strutt, of broker Trinity Financial.<br/>Many people have been shocked by the rise in mortgage rates since December 2021, because they had grown so accustomed to ultra-low interest rates for the previous decade or more.<br/>A variety of economic, and pandemic, reasons kept interest rates down - at times at historic lows.<br/>Anyone who has bought a first home during that time would never have faced such a situation as now. Rates have been much higher in previous decades, but people are now borrowing more as house prices have soared.<br/>Lenders tested applicants' finances for their ability to cope with higher rates. That is now more reality than theory, and will lead some people to question whether they stretched themselves too far. Analysts say the availability of jobs, and a relative lack of unemployment, has saved many from having to sell up.<br/>The impact is felt by tenants too. Higher costs for landlords will push up rental prices, and would lead to fewer homes being available to rent if they decide to leave the sector.<br/>Read more here<br/>Additional reporting by Jemma Dempsey<br/>Mortgage calculator: Will my payments rise?<br/>Rent prices: Have they gone up in your area?<br/>More pain for renters as landlords look to sell up<br/>How the interest rate rise affects you<br/>HSBC reopens mortgage offers after criticism<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The US Coast Guard estimated the sub had between 70 and 96 hours of emergency oxygen, as of 17:00 EST (22:00 BST) on Monday.<br/>Tour firm OceanGate said it was exploring all options to get the crew back safely, and government agencies have joined the rescue operation. <br/>Here is what we know so far. <br/>The Polar Prince arrived near the location of the Titanic wreck in the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday morning. A Facebook post from Hamish Harding, who was on the Titan, said they expected to start the dive in the submersible at 04:00 local time. <br/>The Boston Coast Guard, which is leading the search operation, said on Twitter that the five person crew \"submerged Sunday morning, and the crew of the Polar Prince lost contact with them approximately one hour and 45 minutes into the vessel's dive\". <br/>The Titan submersible was thought to be approximately 900 miles (1450km) off the coast of Cape Cod at the time.<br/>The US Coast Guard's Rear Admiral John Mauger said on Monday that it is a challenge to conduct a search in such a remote area. <br/>The search has two aspects, he said. These are a surface search in case the Titan has returned to the ocean's surface but somehow lost communications, and an underwater sonar search. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Titanic tourist sub search 'a challenge' - Rear Adm John Mauger <br/>The Coast Guard has sent two C-130 Hercules aircraft to search for the submersible on the surface of the water, and has been joined by a Canadian C-130, and a P8 aircraft equipped with underwater sonar capability. Sonar buoys are also being deployed in the area. <br/>Rear Adm John Mauger of the US Coast Guard said it would need additional expertise to rescue the vessel if it was found underwater and he was reaching out for help, including to the US Navy and the private sector. <br/>Canada's defence department said that, along with the aircraft, the Canadian coast guard vessel Kopit Hopson was assisting in the search. <br/>Horizon Maritime, which co-owns the Polar Prince, confirmed to the BBC that vessel is helping and a second vessel, the Horizon Arctic, has been sent to the site. <br/>Among the five people on board the Titan, three people so far have been confirmed - Hamish Harding, a 58-year-old British businessman and explorer, and a Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son, Suleman Dawood. <br/>Mr Harding first announced he was joining the team in June last year, and said that the crew on the vessel includes \"a couple of legendary explorers, some of which have done over 30 dives to the RMS Titanic since the 1980s\".<br/>Mr Harding is the chairman of Action Aviation, an international company which deals with sales and operations in the business aviation industry, based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.<br/>On Twitter, his firm said on Sunday that \"the sub had a successful launch and Hamish is currently diving\". <br/>In a statement on Tuesday, the Dawood family said: \"Our son Shahzada Dawood and his son, Suleman, had embarked on a journey to visit the remnants of the Titanic in the Atlantic Ocean. <br/>\"As of now, contact has been lost with their submersible craft and there is limited information available. <br/>\"We are very grateful for the concern being shown by our colleagues and friends and would like to request everyone to pray for their safety while granting the family privacy at this time.\"<br/>French explorer Paul-Henry Nargeolet is also thought to be on board, according to a Facebook post by Mr Harding before the dive started<br/>And Stockton Rush, chief executive of OceanGate - the firm behind the dive - is also being widely reported to be on the vessel.<br/>OceanGate Expeditions charges guests $250,000 (\u00a3195,270) for a place on its eight-day expedition to see the famous wreck, which sits 3,800m (12,500ft) beneath the surface at the bottom of the Atlantic. <br/>The site is about 600km (370 miles) off the coast of Newfoundland, and lies in two parts, with the bow and the stern separated by about 800m (2,600ft). A huge debris field surrounds the broken vessel.<br/>A full dive to the wreck, including the descent and ascent, reportedly takes eight hours.<br/>Each expedition lasts eight days, according to OceanGate, and each dive is meant to include a scientific objective, including studying the wreck's decay. <br/>The inaugural dive took place in 2021, according to the company's website. <br/>Submarine expert Prof Alistair Greig from University College London has worked through a number of scenarios for where the missing submersible might be, he told BBC Science Correspondent Pallab Ghosh.<br/>One is that it released a \"drop weight\" after an emergency, in order to bring it to the surface.<br/>\"If there was a power failure and/or communication failure, this might have happened, and the submersible would then be bobbing about on the surface waiting to be found,\" he said.<br/>Another scenario, he says, is that the hull was compromised resulting in a leak. \"Then the prognosis is not good.\"<br/>If it has gone down to the seabed and can't get back up under its own power, the options - according to Prof Greig - are very limited.<br/>\"While the submersible might still be intact, if it is deeper than more than 200m (656ft) there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers. The vehicles designed for navy submarine rescue certainly can't get down to anywhere near the depth of the Titanic.\"<br/>The Titan is a five-person submersible built to descend to depths of 4,000 metres (2.5 miles) and travels at three knots - that's about 3.5 miles per hour.<br/>Aside from taking divers to the wreck of the Titanic, it's used for site survey and inspection, research and data collection, film and media production, and deep sea testing of hardware and software.<br/>According to the company, the Titan is \"outfitted with state-of-the-art lighting and sonar navigation systems plus internally and externally mounted 4K video and photographic equipment\". <br/>According to OceanGate's website, the five-person sub has system for monitoring the vessel's hull in real time.<br/>It has sensors to analyse the effects of changing pressure on the sub as it dives, in order to assess the integrity of the structure.<br/>\"This onboard health analysis monitoring system provides early warning detection for the pilot with enough time to arrest the descent and safely return to surface,\" the company says. <br/>The BBC's US partner CBS sent one of its reporters on a voyage with the same company last year to see the wreck of the Titanic.<br/>David Pogue, who went on board, reported that he read a waiver that described the submersible as an \"experimental\" vessel, \"that has not been approved or certified by any regulatory body, and could result in physical injury, disability, emotional trauma or death\".<br/>OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush then gave him a tour of the submersible, where he revealed the vessel only has one button and is run using a video game controller.<br/>What questions do you have about what's happened?

It was the first such incident in 18 days.<br/>In Lviv, the head of the regional authority, Maksym Kozytskyi, said a critically important target had been hit by Iranian-made Shaheed drones and fire had broken out.<br/>\"Today, about five o'clock in the morning [02:00 GMT] during an air raid alert we had three hits,\" he said. \"Fortunately, there are no casualties.\"<br/>In southern Ukraine, Zaporizhzhia was attacked by a number of Iskander-M ballistic missiles, local officials said, adding that nobody had been hurt. <br/>Three drones were also shot down over the southern region of Mykolaiv, the governor said.<br/>The Zaporizhzhia region is the focus of much of the Ukrainian military's current offensive to recapture territory seized by Russia at the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022.<br/>In his nightly TV address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that in some areas the military was moving forward while in others they were holding positions against Russian attack.<br/>Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said hours earlier that Ukrainian forces had recaptured the village of Piatykhatky as they try to break through Russia's front line in the southern region. She said it was the eighth Ukrainian village to be recaptured in the past week.

Do you want pliers involved? Do you want a screwdriver?\" The resulting video was \"the most grotesque thing I have ever seen,\" he said.<br/>McCartney, a former motorcycle gang member who spent time in prison before entering the monkey torture world, ended up running several Telegram groups in which hardcore torture enthusiasts distributed videos. <br/>\"It's no different than drug money,\" he said. \"Drug money comes from dirty hands, this money comes from bloody hands.\"<br/>The BBC also identified two other key suspects who are now being investigated by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - Stacey Storey, a grandmother in her 40s from Alabama who was known in the community as \"Sadistic\", and a ringleader known as \"Mr Ape\" - whose real name we cannot reveal for safety reasons.<br/>\"Mr Ape\" confessed in an interview with the BBC that he had been responsible for the deaths of at least four monkeys and the torture of many more. He had commissioned \"extremely brutal\" videos, he said.<br/>Storey's phone was seized by Department of Homeland Security agents, who found nearly 100 torture videos, as well as evidence that she had paid for the creation of some of the most extreme videos produced. <br/>According to police sources, Storey was active in a torture group as recently as earlier this month. Approached by the BBC in Alabama in January, Storey claimed that she had been hacked and declined to comment on the allegations in detail. <br/>\"Mr Ape\", Stacey Storey and Mike McCartney are three of five key targets in the ongoing Homeland Security investigation. They have yet to be charged, but could face up to seven years in prison if prosecuted based on evidence gathered by the DHS.<br/>Special Agent Paul Wolpert, who is leading the DHS investigation, said everyone involved from law enforcement had been deeply shocked by the nature of the alleged crimes.<br/>\"I don't know if anybody would ever be ready for a crime like this,\" he said. \"The same with the attorneys and the juries, and anybody who reads that this is going on. It is going to be a shocker I think.\"<br/>Anybody involved in buying or distributing the monkey torture videos should \"expect a knock on the door at some point\", Agent Wolpert said. \"You are not going to get away with it.\"<br/>Police in Indonesia have arrested two torture suspects. Asep Yadi Nurul Hikmah was charged with animal torture and the sale of a protected species, and sentenced to three years in prison. M Ajis Rasjana was sentenced to eight months - the maximum sentence available for torturing an animal.<br/>Monkey torture videos are still easily accessible on Telegram and now Facebook, where the BBC recently found dozens of groups sharing extreme content, some with more than 1,000 members.<br/>\"We've seen an escalation in this extreme, graphic content, which used to be hidden but is now circulating openly on platforms like Facebook,\" said Sarah Kite, co-founder of animal charity Action for Primates. <br/>Facebook told the BBC it had removed the groups we brought to the company's attention. \"We don't allow the promotion of animal abuse on our platforms and we remove this content when we become aware of it, like we did in this case,\" a spokesperson said.<br/>Ms Kite also called for UK laws to be updated to make it easier to prosecute individuals who pay for torture videos to be made. \"If someone is proactively involved in inflicting that pain by paying for it and providing a list of things they want done to the animal, there should be stronger laws to hold them to account,\" she said.<br/>YouTube told the BBC in a statement that animal abuse had \"no place\" on the platform and the company was \"working hard to quickly remove violative content\". <br/>\"Just this year alone, we've removed hundreds of thousands of videos and terminated thousands of channels for violating our violent and graphic policies,\" the statement said.<br/>Telegram said it was \"committed to protecting user privacy and human rights such as freedom of speech\", adding that its moderators \"cannot proactively patrol private groups\".<br/>The Monkey Haters<br/>You can read the full story on the BBC News website, watch the documentary The Monkey Haters on BBC iPlayer (UK only), on YouTube, or listen to the radio version on BBC Sounds. <br/>Hunting the monkey torturers<br/>Catching the men who sell subway groping videos<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

They were ordered to suspend their practice for six months, and were fined 1.4m Taiwanese dollars (\u00a335,989, $46,121).<br/>Amid growing public concern, Taipei City Hospital has also begun offering free blood tests for preschool children to check for traces of sedatives.<br/>The measures come after the scandal first emerged in May, when parents at a private preschool in New Taipei City accused staff of feeding their children \"unknown drugs\".<br/>Mike, a father of a five-year-old child, told BBC Chinese that parents had noticed what appeared to be withdrawal symptoms in their children over the long Lunar New Year holiday period in February.<br/>\"Some parents found their children, over the vacation, had become irritable, restless and screamed when sleeping, and even cried out with leg cramps,\" he said.<br/>After speaking to the children, parents learnt that their teachers had fed them an \"unknown potion\". Complaints were filed with police in April and May.<br/>Following more complaints from parents in June, local authorities launched an investigation, and found at least eight children with trace amounts of phenobarbital and benzodiazepines - a class of psychoactive drugs - in their system. <br/>The kindergarten at the centre of the controversy, a franchise of the Kid Castle Educational Institute, was ordered to shut down on 12 June. Its directors have been fined 150,000 Taiwanese dollars(\u00a33,800 $4,872).<br/>The principal and five teachers were arrested and questioned by police but have since been released on bail. A criminal investigation is underway. <br/>Local media reported that the staff said the parents had consented to a list of medicine provided by the school but some parents in response questioned the medicines used by the school.<br/>A Taiwanese pharmacist told local media that, although rare, some cough and gastrointestinal medicine contain phenobarbital.  <br/>Drugs containing phenobarbital are mostly used in the treatment of epilepsy and or used as surgical anaesthesia, and are difficult to obtain. <br/>Benzodiazepines are a class of depressant drugs most commonly used to treat severe anxiety.<br/>The drugs are highly addictive, and overdose may lead to drowsiness and shortness of breath. <br/>China and Taiwan: A really simple guide<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It is a fine line to walk, however, as the competition - both militarily and economically - heats up. <br/>With the meeting, Mr Xi was also sending a message to his own people that his government was reaching out to Washington. <br/>Taiwan is the biggest area of contention between the two countries and the one that has the highest potential of escalating.<br/>China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province and Mr Xi has indicated that he wishes to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control during his term in office.<br/>However, Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland with its own constitution and leaders. US President Joe Biden said last year that the US would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack from China, a move condemned by Beijing.<br/>But on Monday, Mr Blinken again stressed that Washington does not support Taiwan independence, adding that he sought to \"disabuse\" China of the notion the US is \"seeking to economically contain them\".<br/>He said China gave some assurances too. It again stressed that it would not supply lethal aid to Russia to use in Ukraine, but Mr Blinken shared concerns about private Chinese companies aiding Russia's military.<br/>However, China knocked back a US proposal to restart communication channels between the countries' militaries - a key objective of the talks.<br/>While the trip yielded no great progress - as was expected - when concluding his news conference, Mr Blinken said he hoped it signalled better communication in the future.<br/>\"Progress is hard.

Planted on top in three strict lines are red, blue and white blooms to mirror the national flag. A patriotic flowerbed for a Russian prison.<br/>But I'm not here for the gardening. <br/>Behind these walls, Alexei Navalny - Russia's most famous prisoner and the Kremlin's most vocal critic - is about to go on trial. Again. <br/>Prison guards conduct a thorough search of our bags. Cue the sniffer dogs. <br/>Finally, we're let through. We're under strict instructions not to turn on our video camera until permitted to do so. <br/>Along with the other journalists who've made the journey here to Melekhovo, we're led into a building.<br/>We're not allowed into the hall which has been turned into a temporary courtroom. Neither are Mr Navalny's parents who are here, too. Instead, for now, we can follow proceedings on a video screen in a separate room. <br/>The signal's switched on and the picture appears. It's a wide shot of the makeshift courtroom. No close-ups. <br/>But Alexei Navalny is visible, sitting at a table with his defence lawyers. He's clearly lost a lot of weight in prison. <br/>But Mr Navalny is engaged and defiant as he rails against the judge and condemns the decision to try him here. <br/>On paper, it's a Moscow court that is hearing the case. But the trial is taking place 150 miles (240km) from the Russian capital.<br/>That suggests the Russian authorities want to avoid the publicity that transporting Mr Navalny to Moscow would inevitably bring. <br/>The picture on the screen doesn't last long. An hour and a half after the start of the trial, the prosecutor demands that proceedings are held behind closed doors. <br/>The judge rules in favour. The video feed is cut. <br/>It will now be even harder to follow what's happening to Russia's most prominent opposition leader in his trial behind bars. <br/>Jailed in 2021, Alexei Navalny is currently serving a nine-year prison term here for parole violations, fraud and contempt of court - charges widely seen as politically motivated. <br/>But that nine-year term is set to increase dramatically. <br/>In this new trial, he faces multiple charges that could add decades to his time behind bars. They include creating an extremist organisation and financing extremist activities. <br/>The authorities have already declared Mr Navalny's network of campaign offices and his Anti-Corruption Foundation \"extremist\" and shut them down. <br/>There may be worse to come. Mr Navalny says investigators told him to expect another case, another trial, this time related to terrorism charges.<br/>Why do the charges and trials keep coming? Why do the Russian authorities seem determined to pile on the pressure and keep Alexei Navalny behind bars?<br/>Over the years, Vladimir Putin's Kremlin has been busy removing all potential rivals to the president - clearing the Russian political landscape of any potential challengers. It will want to make sure that its loudest critic stays well away from Russia's political stage. <br/>For more than a decade, Alexei Navalny has exposed corruption at the heart of Russian power. His video investigations have received tens of millions of views online.<br/>But even more than this, perhaps, it is his ability to mobilise the public, especially young Russians, to take to the streets in anti-government protests which makes the authorities nervous. <br/>In recent years, he has been the only Russian opposition leader capable of organising anti-Putin street protests on a national scale. <br/>He had set up a network of regional campaign offices, having planned to run for president in 2018. He was barred from the vote.<br/>In 2020, Mr Navalny was poisoned in Siberia by what Western laboratories later confirmed to be a nerve agent. <br/>He accused the Kremlin of trying to kill him. The Russian authorities deny that. <br/>After receiving urgent medical care in Germany, his decision to return to Russia in 2021 will have been viewed by those in power here as a direct challenge to the Kremlin. He was arrested on arrival.<br/>Russia's Navalny says he is facing jail beyond 2050<br/>Jailed opposition activist's lawyer flees Russia<br/>Navalny: Russia's jailed but vociferous Putin critic<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Under 5% of the country's 1.4 billion people are estimated to have ever taken a flight and air traffic in India has been growing hugely as disposable incomes rise. <br/>In February, Air India, IndiGo's rival, made headlines by placing its own order for 470 aircraft from both Airbus and Boeing. <br/>This latest deal shows that confidence is returning to the airline industry in the wake of the pandemic - and this order from the low-cost carrier is a statement of ambition from one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world. <br/>Ryanair and Saudi start-up Riyadh Air have also recently made large aircraft orders. But while airlines now seem keen to invest in new aircraft, manufacturers are struggling to build them quickly enough, because supply chains remain disrupted by the after-effects of the Covid shutdowns.<br/>While this may be by far the most dramatic order seen so far at the Paris Airshow, it is unlikely to be the last. <br/>The airliner market ground to a halt during the pandemic, but now carriers are making up for lost time, renewing their fleets and in some cases expanding aggressively as well.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The helicopter reportedly fired at militants on the ground while Israeli forces tried to extract soldiers.  <br/>One resident told local media: \"We are unable to leave the house, it's a real war here. Apache helicopters are flying over our heads.\"<br/>\"The helicopter bombed a field in our neighbourhood. Some people were injured and a water pipe was damaged, causing water outages in large parts of Jenin camp.\"<br/>The Palestinian Authority described the raid as \"Israeli aggression on Jenin [which] is a serious, dangerous escalation and must stop immediately\".<br/>Over the past 18 months, Israel has intensified its military search, arrest and home demolition raids into Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank, amid a sharp rise in Palestinian attacks targeting Israelis - with casualty rates on both sides reaching levels not seen in many years. <br/>Since the start of this year, at least 162 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, while 21 Israelis have been killed.<br/>Before dawn on Monday, undercover Israeli troops entered a neighbourhood on the edge of Jenin's packed urban refugee camp, targeting the family home of a militant jailed by Israel, eyewitnesses said. <br/>\"I looked out the window and saw masked soldiers storming the house of our neighbour, Assem Abu al-Haija. After about a quarter of an hour, I heard several explosions and heavy gunfire,\" Somaya Abu Samaan told Palestine TV.<br/>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described a \"massive exchange of fire\" between its forces and Palestinian gunmen. <br/>Videos showed an explosion hitting armoured troop transport as shots rang out.<br/>An Israeli military spokesman said a Panther troop carrier was hit by an \"unusual and dramatic\" improvised explosive device (IED), after which an Israeli Apache helicopter fired on an open area to repel the gunmen as forces extracted soldiers from the troop transport.<br/>\"We don't know the nature of the IED, it was pretty intense,\" Lt Col Richard Hecht said.    <br/>He said the IDF were now bringing in heavy machinery to try to extract the vehicles, while exchanges of fire with militants continued. He added that soldiers who were previously inside the carrier had been moved to other protected vehicles.<br/>The Palestinian health ministry said five men and a 15-year-old boy, whom it named as Ahmed Yousef Saqr, were killed during the raid. The fifth man died of his wounds on Tuesday morning.<br/>The ministry added that more than 90 Palestinians were wounded, including a 15-year-old girl who local reports said was hit by a bullet which came through the wall of her home. <br/>A Palestinian photojournalist covering the raid, Hazem Imad Nasser, was also among those wounded. Palestinian medics said he underwent surgery after being shot in his side.<br/>The Palestine Red Crescent Society, meanwhile, accused the Israeli army of stopping medical teams reaching casualties. <br/>The society's director in Jenin, Dr Mahmoud al-Saadi, told the BBC: \"We are working in very difficult conditions. The occupation [Israeli] forces impeded the movement of ambulances and prevented medical staff from performing their duties.\"<br/>The raid is a further sign that US-led attempts to de-escalate tensions in the West Bank are failing.  <br/>Officials had hoped to reduce the intensity of Israeli military raids and impel the Palestinian Authority to regain its grip in the cities of Jenin and Nablus, where they have lost control to a new generation of militants. <br/>Hussein al-Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority's civil affairs minister, said a \"fierce and open war is being waged against the Palestinian people... by the occupation forces\".<br/>He called for the Palestinian leadership to take \"unprecedented decisions\" without elaborating.<br/>Israel's use of aircraft would \"push our fighters to use tools that will surprise the enemy\", an official with the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad said. It claimed two of the dead men as members. <br/>Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said: \"We will use all the tools at our disposal and strike terrorists wherever they may be. Terrorists will not find a safe haven - not in Jenin, not in Nablus, and not in Gaza.\"<br/>In a separate development, the United States said it was \"deeply troubled\" by new Israeli plans to expand Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and make changes that will see a hard-line pro-settler minister, Bezalel Smotrich, take authority over future planning there.<br/>Mr Smotrich heads a far-right, religious ultranationalist bloc that has espoused racist, anti-Palestinian policies.   <br/>A senior Israeli official played down the move, saying it was part of measures to cut \"unnecessary administrative red tape in the construction authorisation process\".<br/>The US state department said Israel's actions violated previous commitments it had made to the Biden administration, while Palestinian leaders condemned the new steps and called on the international community to intervene.  <br/>Settlements are seen as illegal under international law, but Israel disputes that.<br/>Anger at Israeli probe into shooting of toddler<br/>Israeli troops not charged over Palestinian's death<br/>Palestinian youths 'losing hope with political process'<br/>Palestinian gunmen killed in Israeli West Bank raid<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

He feared the ship could reveal valuable German secrets if seized by the British.<br/>The Graf Spee had been a great threat to the Allied forces in WWII, having sunk eight merchant ships between the outbreak of war in September 1939 and its scuttling in December of that year. <br/>\"It occurred to us that this symbol of war could undergo a transformation into a symbol of peace or union, like a dove,\" the president had said on Friday. <br/>A Uruguayan sculptor, Pablo Atchugarry, had been commissioned to recast the eagle. <br/>Mr Atchugarry accepted what he called the \"challenge of transforming hate, war and destruction into a symbol of peace\".<br/>But just two days later, President Lacalle Pou announced that the idea had been shelved. <br/>\"In the few hours that have passed [since the announcement], an overwhelming majority of people has come forward who don't share the decision. When you aim for peace, the first thing you need to do is create unity and this [idea] clearly didn't,\" Mr Lacalle Pou said. <br/>He did not say what would happen to the bronze now. <br/>The fate of the eagle - whose ownership was the subject of a long legal battle - has been a matter of controversy since it was first raised from the river bed. <br/>When it was briefly exhibited years ago, Germany complained, asking the Uruguayan state not to showcase \"Nazi paraphernalia\".<br/>When a court in Uruguay ruled that the eagle should be auctioned off to pay off the private investors who had financed its recovery from the River Plate, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organisation dedicated to Holocaust research and remembrance, warned that it could fall into the hands of Nazi sympathisers.<br/>While Uruguay's Supreme Court ruled last year that the eagle belonged to the Uruguayan state, its government appears no closer to deciding what its fate should be.<br/>Nazi eagle up for auction 'should go to museum'<br/>What should Uruguay do with its Nazi eagle?<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Clearly those are no longer getting a response,\" Mr Pogue said, adding that Titan had got lost for about three hours during the expedition he was on last year. <br/>He described being initially hesitant about going aboard the sub at all because some of the components appeared \"off the shelf, sort of improvised\". <br/>\"You steer this sub with an Xbox game controller, some of the ballast is abandoned construction pipes.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Mike went to see the Titanic before and says we're all aware of the risks, it's not a lark<br/>Mr Pogue said he had been reassured by Titan's inventor and Stockton Rush, the chief executive of OceanGate, that the carbon-fibre main capsule had been co-designed with Nasa and the University of Washington and was \"rock solid\". <br/>Mr Reiss said that the Titan is \"a beautifully designed craft\" but that problems can arise due to the nature of the expedition.<br/>\"This is not to say this is a shoddy ship or anything, it's just that this is all new technology and they're learning it as they go along. <br/>\"You have to just remember the early days of the space programme or the early days of aviation, where you just make a lot of mistakes on the way to figuring out what you're doing.\"<br/>Titanic's wreck lies some 435 miles (700km) south of St John's, Newfoundland, though the rescue mission is being run from Boston, Massachusetts.<br/>Among those aboard the submersible is the British billionaire businessman and explorer Hamish Harding, according to his family. <br/>Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son, Suleman, were also on board, their family said in a statement.<br/>French explorer Paul-Henry Nargeolet is thought to be on board, according to a Facebook post by Mr Harding before the dive started<br/>Mr Rush, the head of OceanGate is also being widely reported to be on the vessel.<br/>In a statement on Monday, OceanGate said its \"entire focus [was] on the crewmembers in the submersible and their families\".<br/>The company added that it was \"deeply thankful\" for the \"extensive assistance\" it had been given from government agencies and companies involved in deep sea operations.<br/>The Titanic, which was the largest ship of its time, hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912.

But Armenians have been here since the 4th Century, when their country was the first to adopt Christianity as a national religion. <br/>They have a share in the Old City's holiest Christian sites and their own quarter tucked away in its south-western corner, home to some 2,000 Armenians.<br/>But now the community here feels under threat because of a murky real estate deal by its own Church leaders. Amid angry protests, the Armenian patriarch has hidden himself away and a disgraced priest, who denies any wrongdoing, has fled to California. <br/>\"It's like a puzzle. I mean, we are trying to know what happened, when it happened, and how,\" explains community activist Hagop Djernazian.  <br/>What has emerged is that some 25% of the Armenian Quarter has been sold on a 99-year lease to a mysterious Jewish Australian businessman for a luxury development.  <br/>The land includes a large car parking area - one of the few areas of open land inside the Old City walls - which his company has already taken over. Many Armenians had hoped the site could be used to build affordable housing for young couples from their tiny, shrinking community. <br/>According to plans seen unofficially by Hagop and others, an Ottoman-era building housing five Armenian households, a restaurant, shops and the seminary are all part of the sell-off. Many fear this could affect the viability of living in the quarter in the long-term. <br/>But the controversy extends far more widely.  <br/>\"It is historical land that we have had for 700 years. Losing it with one signature will affect our cultural daily life, but it will also change the picture of Jerusalem,\" Hagop says. \"It will change the status quo, the entire mosaic of Jerusalem.\" <br/>As the Orthodox Easter celebrations took place in April, panic was spreading among Armenians. The Armenian Patriarch, Nourhan Manougian, admitted that he had signed away the land but said he had been deceived by a local priest who worked for him. <br/>That priest was defrocked and later there were heated scenes as he was banished from the Armenian Quarter, escorted away under Israeli police protection as residents yelled out \"traitor\".   <br/>Recently, many Armenians have been joining weekly protests, linking arms and singing nationalistic songs below the window of the patriarch who now stays cloistered in his rooms at the convent. They demand that he revokes the land deal. <br/>Amid a recent rise in attacks by extremist Jews targeting Christians in Jerusalem, some Armenians see the sale as an act of self-inflicted harm on the Christian presence here. <br/>\"The look of the city, its character is changing very much,\" says Arda, who lives in the Old City and complains that religious nationalists already feel emboldened by the drift of Israeli politics. <br/>\"Priests walking in the streets find settlers spitting at them, people say they don't want to see Christmas trees in the city, and restaurants are being attacked for no reason. It's all going in a certain direction.\" <br/>Israel captured East Jerusalem - including the Old City - from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War and went on to occupy and annex it in a move that is not recognised internationally. In the decades since, it has been at the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, claimed by both sides as their capital. Plots of land here are fiercely fought over. <br/>There is a reminder of that near to the Armenian Quarter, at Jaffa Gate - the iconic entrance to the Christian Quarter.   <br/>Here, two landmark hotels, run by Palestinians, were secretly sold to foreign firms acting as fronts for a radical Jewish settler group. The Greek Orthodox Church lost a two-decade-long battle to cancel the deal in the Israeli courts and last year settlers moved into part of one of the hotels.   <br/>Armenian elders say that in the past, there have been frequent approaches by settlers wanting to buy land in their quarter and increase the Jewish presence in East Jerusalem. The Armenian Quarter is located next to the Jewish one, which makes it especially desirable.  <br/>However, a spokesman for the settler group which bought the Jaffa Gate properties told the BBC he had no knowledge of the Armenian land sale.   <br/>Meanwhile, in interviews in the US, the cast-out priest, Baret Yeretsian, has dismissed the idea that the buyer of the land lease - named as Danny Rothman but also Daniel Rubinstein in some documents - is driven by ideology.   <br/>Nevertheless, Palestinian Christian leaders say the sale has political implications.   <br/>\"It undermines any future political solution to Jerusalem,\" says Dimitri Diliani, president of the National Christian Coalition of the Holy Land. \"According to international law, it's on occupied land that is subject to negotiations and this kind of reinforces the illegal settler presence in Palestinian East Jerusalem.\"   <br/>He believes that \"the diversity\" of Jerusalem will also be badly affected. <br/>Highlighting the significance of the Armenian Church's actions, both the Palestinian President and Jordan's King Abdullah II - custodian of Jerusalem's Christian holy sites - have suspended their recognition of the patriarch. This affects his ability to attend ceremonies and sign off on official church business.   <br/>Israel's foreign ministry has said it is aware of the Armenian patriarch's deal but due to the political sensitivity it refrains from commenting on it.  <br/>Meanwhile, in the walled courtyards of St James Convent - which has been home to many Armenian families since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and has its own clubs, school, library and even a football pitch - the talk nowadays is about little else.   <br/>Relations have been strained between the residents and clergy members, who act here as the religious and civil authority. On Friday, dozens of Armenian Jerusalemites gathered to hear from a group of international Armenian lawyers who have been visiting and have agreed to draw up recommendations on how to handle the case.<br/>Nearby, in his ceramics shop, Garo Sandrouni paints glaze onto an ornately decorated bowl wondering what the future will bring.<br/>He is from one of the families that brought the colourful tradition of Armenian pottery to Jerusalem a century ago, when they fled from what is widely seen as a genocide by the Turks.  <br/>He says that Armenians historically donated money to buy land in this holy city - their spiritual homeland - and that the Church has no right to sell it. <br/>\"This is what makes us angry. These lands belong to the Armenian nation. They don't belong to the Armenian patriarchate of Jerusalem,\" he tells me. <br/>\"The Armenian patriarchate of Jerusalem has to take care of these lands to keep them to preserve them, to protect them.\" <br/>Jerusalem Christians say attacks on the rise<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

He did not elaborate, but vowed to hunt down the militants in their hide-outs across the border in the Democratic Republic of Congo.<br/>The ADF has not yet commented. <br/>It was formed in the 1990s and took up arms against Mr Museveni, alleging persecution of the minority Muslims population.<br/>Its leader reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group in 2016.<br/>But it was not until April 2019 that IS first acknowledged its activity in the area, when it claimed an attack on army positions near the border with Uganda.<br/>This statement marked the announcement of IS's \"Central Africa Province\" (Iscap).<br/>Six students are believed to have been abducted as the militants retreated to DR Congo.<br/>Julius was among six people who managed to survive the assault which lasted for several hours. <br/>He did not identify the attackers, but said they were gun-wielding men who launched their attack at about 22:00 local time. <br/>They came to the boys' dormitory but the students had locked it after realising they were in danger.<br/>\"When they couldn't open the door they hurled a bomb inside the dormitory and then used hammers and axes to break down the door,\" he said. <br/>Julius was standing behind many of the students who had formed a shield near the door and were shot dead when the militants got into the dormitory.<br/>There were cries as the students were gunned down, hacked or shot to death.<br/>He quickly climbed to the top of a bunk bed, removed some of the wooden planks of the ceiling, and jumped inside to hide.<br/>From there, he helplessly watched his colleagues being brutally murdered by the assailants, who then set fire to mattresses and left.<br/>\"I was overwhelmed by the smoke and dropped back down into the dormitory with a thud,\" he said.<br/>The militants heard the thud and came back.<br/>It was at that point that Julius knew he had to come out of the attack alive. <br/>\"I lay next to the bloodied bodies of my friends and thought very fast. Then I smeared a lot of blood into my ears, mouth and on my head and when the militants came, they checked my hand for a pulse and left,\" Julius said.<br/>Another survivor, Godwin Mumbere, was in the same dormitory as Julius. <br/>The 18-year-old recalled the assailants going to the girls' dormitory, dragging them out and hacking them to death with machetes.<br/>They then came to the boys' dormitory, broke down the door and started attacking the students.<br/>The bed Godwin was hiding under was overturned and his friends who were on top fell to the ground and were killed. <br/>\"The attackers saw me but thought I was dead,\" he told the BBC. <br/>But they went out and came back into the dormitory to ensure everyone was dead. <br/>\"It was at this point that they shot me in the hand and set the dorm ablaze,\" he said.<br/>Godwin was brought back to reality by the shouts of another student who said they were dying.<br/>He ran out of the dormitory, scaled the school gate and ran to a nearby hardware store through a cocoa plantation. He got to a lodge and hid under a vehicle until he was rescued.<br/>Clarice Bwambare, the senior administrator of Bwera General Hospital, told the BBC they started receiving the bodies of students and residents at around 01:00 - about three hours after the attack started on Friday night. <br/>He noted that out of the 20 bodies they received, 18 were those of students.<br/>Five survivors are currently recuperating at the hospital. One of them is a girl who is in critical condition at the intensive care unit. A surgeon advised that she cannot be moved because of a severe head injury from being hit with a hammer by the rebels.<br/>Mr Bwambare said only one body had not been claimed from the mortuary.<br/>On Sunday, grief-stricken families buried 21 of the students, according to Uganda's New Vision newspaper. <br/>Lying on his hospital bed, Julius expressed regret that he could not attend their funerals. He said he wished he was a soldier who could fight back and save the lives of his friends and colleagues. <br/>Uganda school attack: 'Gospel songs then screaming'<br/>Who are the ADF?<br/>Inside the ADF - a defector's story<br/>Focus on Africa podcasts<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The NCERT, an autonomous organisation under the federal education ministry, oversees syllabus changes and textbook content for children taking exams under the government-run Central Board of Secondary Education.<br/>Among dropped topics are paragraphs on attempts by extreme Hindu nationalists to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi and chapters on federalism and diversity. <br/>The NCERT has also dropped content related to the 2002 Gujarat riots; removed a chapter on Mughal rulers in India; and moved portions on the periodic table and theory of evolution in science books to higher grades, sparking criticism.<br/>The council had said earlier that the changes, which were first announced last year as part of a syllabus \"rationalisation\" exercise, wouldn't affect knowledge but instead reduce the load on children after the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>But now some academics who were part of committees that helped design and develop the older textbooks say they don't want to be associated with the new curriculum.<br/>On 8 June, political scientists Suhas Palshikar and Yogendra Yadav - who were advisers for political science books originally published in 2006 for classes 9 to 12 - wrote to NCERT, asking it to remove their names from the print and digital editions of the books.<br/>The academics said they objected to the \"innumerable and irrational cuts and large deletions\" as they failed to see \"any pedagogic rationale\" behind the changes. <br/>The NCERT issued a statement saying such a request \"was out of question\" because it holds the copyright of all the material it publishes. When contacted, NCERT director DS Saklani referred the BBC to the statement on its website.<br/>The deadlock intensified last week when more than 30 academics also wrote to NCERT asking for their names to be withdrawn from the Textbook Development Committees (TDC) listed in the books. The scholars argued that possessing copyright did not entitle the NCERT to make changes to texts they wrote. <br/>But NCERT said that the TDC's role was \"limited to advising how to design and develop the textbooks or contributing to the development of their contents and not beyond this\". <br/>It also clarified that the rationalised content is applicable only for the current academic year and that a new set of textbooks will soon be developed based on fresh guidelines that adhere to the new National Education Policy. <br/>The argument has pitted academics against each other. Critics argue that textbooks should serve as a source of introspection and accuse the NCERT of erasing portions that are not palatable to the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. \"The decision of \"rationalisation\" shows either that the NCERT does not value its autonomy or its leadership does not understand its place in a democracy,\"  Peter Ronald DeSouza, who asked for his name to be withdrawn, wrote last week.<br/>But the NCERT has also received support. Last week, 73 academics issued a statement arguing that school textbooks were in sore need of an update.<br/>\"[The critics'] demand is that students continue to study from 17-year-old textbooks rather than updated textbooks. In their quest to further their political agenda, they are ready to endanger the future of crores [tens of millions] of children across the country,\" they said.<br/>Supporters include the head of India's prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and the chief of the country's university watchdog, the University Grants Commission (UGC).<br/>\"Scrutiny should be lauded as long it is rooted in hard facts and evidence. Selective reading and mischaracterisation do not breed transparency or accountability but undermine them,\" JNU's vice chancellor Santishree Dhulipudi Pandit wrote, arguing that the media amplified a lot of \"unverified information\" on the issue. <br/>Controversies over textbook revision are not new in India - both nationally and at the state level, different governments have often sought to introduce or withdraw changes in line with their ideological beliefs. Most scholars also advocate routinely reviewing the books to update information and strike a balance between content and learning outcomes.<br/>But the critics say this review should be done in a transparent and holistic way. <br/>\"Textbooks, as the title the term describes it, hold a sacred place in the education system. Both the teacher and the student rely on them as their first authentic source of how to approach a subject,\" Mr Palshikar says. <br/>The NCERT's textbooks receive a lot of scrutiny as thousands of schools across the country use them. The books are also used for reference by candidates appearing for competitive exams. \"So, then the catchment area of these books is huge,\" Mr Palshikar says. <br/>Experts say that the role of any thoughtfully designed curriculum is to immerse students in topics that spark discussion, allowing them to encounter questions that are relevant not just to their other coursework but also their lives. <br/>But when there is an \"an indiscriminate deletion of some paragraphs and sentences\", the continuity of the argument in the textbook is destroyed, seriously hampering the learning process, Mr Palshikar says.<br/>He adds that they are also objecting to the current deletions because it is not clear what the NCERT's consultation process was like. \"Our only complaint is that if you have consulted anyone else, then put their names rather than our names on the book.\"<br/>To evaluate the books in question, the NCERT says it tasked in-house faculty members and external experts, who eventually recommended the changes.   <br/>The process accounted for five broad criteria: the overlapping of content among different subjects in the same class; similar content in the lower or higher class in the same subject; difficulty levels; content that is easily accessible to children and \"does not require much intervention from the teachers\". And lastly, content \"that is not relevant in the present context\". <br/>Relevant information that was removed or rationalised has been included - \"either in the same subject in different classes or in a different subject in the same class\", four members of the Council's textbook team wrote in an article in the Indian Express. <br/>So the periodic table has not been removed entirely from Class 9 and 10 textbooks but instead reassigned to the Class 11 textbook. Mughal history has not been entirely omitted from the curriculum. And Darwin's theory of evolution is covered in chapter six of the Class 12 textbook.<br/>\"No scientific theory is absolute - it can be contested. The latest debates that have questioned Darwin's theory of evolution need to also be a part of the curriculum\", Ms Pandit from JNU wrote.<br/>However, some experts feel such \"arbitrary\" changes do more damage than good. <br/>Even UGC chief Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar, who is largely in favour of the rationalisation exercise, agrees with some of the criticism, especially about teaching science.<br/>\"The global practice is that topics such as evolution, the periodic table and sources of energy are taught to students before they complete 10th standard,\" he wrote this week, adding, however, that the NCERT's intentions shouldn't be doubted. <br/>Mr Palshikar points out that the argument comes amid a larger churn in state-funded education in India.<br/>\"I think higher education in India has been losing its soul for a long time, particularly in humanities and social sciences because of the pressure to get jobs. The basic purpose of higher education - of questioning and exploring - has been lost,\" he says. <br/>\"We are currently in the midst of a very small debate compared to that.\"<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

Ukraine's advance in southern Donetsk has stuttered, but continues.<br/>The BBC joined the 68th Jaeger Brigade as its combat forces sought to expand their control eastward of the recently regained village of Blahodatne. <br/>In their sights were a series of trenches protecting Russian forces on nearby hilltops. <br/>The men of a specialised drone unit grab cameras, roll cables and load a pickup truck with tins of ammunition, crates of smoke grenades and armour-piercing rounds. <br/>Aside from them, there's little sign of life in Blahodatne. Down a lane, the wreckage of two heavily armoured American-made MRAP vehicles lie stranded, one a burnt-out shell. There are more of these mine-resistant vehicles disabled in the fields beyond.<br/>\"Steer clear of those, the Russians keep hitting them,\" we are warned. Russia has made much of the losses of Western-donated tanks and vehicles, even as Vladimir Putin admitted it has lost dozens of tanks since the counter-offensive began on 5 June. <br/>Troops are attacking at three points: Bakhmut, where they are advancing north and south of the city, which remains firmly under Russian control; south of Zaporizhzhia; and in southern Donetsk, where a number of villages have been taken back.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Yaroslav starts talking about the frequency of Russian fire and is interrupted by a blast<br/>Blahodatne is one of those. Another salvo comes in and the soldiers take cover in the cellar of a ruined house. <br/>A dirt floor passageway is lit with oil lamps, casting soft yellow light down its length to a stone and iron stove with three sturdy pots atop. Towels hang from a washing line. A rough wooden door opens and, in a headscarf, Nina Fedorivna emerges.<br/>She has been living down here for the past year. Russian soldiers came by only once, she says.  <br/>She never, for a second, considered leaving the village. <br/>The artillery barrage over, we leave through a lane at the end of her house. Three Russian corpses lie in a ditch, just beyond Nina Fedorivna's vegetable patch. A truck with the Z symbol, which was used by Russian forces, sits nearby riddled with bullet and shrapnel holes. The fighting here was at close quarters. <br/>Throughout the village roses are in bloom - but the smell of corpses catches the back of your throat. <br/>There's no time to delay - the soldiers have an air of concentration and purpose. They are clearly preparing for something.<br/>They head east, leaving Blahodatne behind. The two-car convoy is well spaced in case of Russian attack. The fields around are heavily mined, poles with red-and-white ribbon mark cleared ground. <br/>As we get close to another abandoned American armoured vehicle, there's an explosion, just missing the wreckage. It is likely from a Russian drone. <br/>I was in this area back in March. Then, the front lines had barely moved a few metres in months. Russia was using far more artillery than Ukrainian forces, who mainly hunkered down in trenches waiting for the barrages to end. At the time, a commander told me they were conserving their shells for the counter-offensive. On this visit, Ukrainian guns didn't stop for the two days I was with the brigade.  <br/>The cars speed on to a network of trenches hidden in a line of trees. There, company commander, Senior Sergeant Andrii Onistrat, 49, runs his men through their next mission - a Ukrainian assault is planned for the next day on the Russian trenches, 3km (1.8 miles) away at the foot of the low hills to the south.<br/>In their attempt to widen the front, sections of the 68th Brigade will attack from the countryside east of Blahodatne and Makarivka, across minefields and directly in the line of Russian fire. <br/>Sgt Onistrat runs through the drone team's communication protocols and targets. The section loses as many as five drones a day. Tanned and with a brilliant white grin, he looks at his grim-faced men and gives one final order: \"Smile - why are you so serious? We are winning the war.\"<br/>Twenty-four hours later, most of the same men are in a sweltering dugout. The attack is under way. <br/>From their surveillance cameras I can see two armoured vehicles slowly making their way through the minefield. Drone after drone is sent above the Russian positions dropping smoke grenades, creating a smoke screen along the Russian-occupied trenches to allow vehicles to advance and confuse enemy anti-tank weapons. As I watch, Ukrainian shells repeatedly strike the treeline.  <br/>Yuri, a young soldier, runs in and out of the dugout, changing drone batteries and sending them into flight, while voices bark orders and target positions across the radios. Mosquitoes and horseflies are feasting on the men, but still \"Frisbee\", from western Ukraine, has taken his shirt off because of the heat. <br/>Their enemy isn't holding back. As I stand outside, a Russian strike lands close enough to throw dirt into the trench. Standing lookout in wrap-around shades and without body armour is Zheka. <br/>Another Russian shell lands close and I hit the ground. I look up and Zheka hasn't flinched. He shouts in English - expletives directed at the Russians - and gives two middle fingers to the air. Salvoes of Grad rockets rain down on Ukrainian positions. <br/>More broadly, the counter-offensive is made more difficult because of the lack of Ukrainian air power. The West has promised F-16 fighter planes, but they will not arrive until later this year. <br/>Back outside in the trenches, another soldier, Yaroslav, explains: \"Russian helicopters, Russians jets fire at every area, every day\". He's interrupted as another strike lands nearby. \"Go to the shelter, good luck,\" he says. <br/>When, on 3 June, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine was ready for the counter-offensive, he mentioned Russian air superiority and warned many Ukrainian lives would be lost. And so it has been for the 68th Brigade. <br/>Sgt Onistrat says this weighs heavily on him. \"The severity of the day depends solely on one thing - the number of people we lose. The last week has been extremely difficult. We have lost a large number of people.\"<br/>On his head he wears a ballistic helmet, a size too small. I mention it and he starts to weep. \"It was my son's,\" he says. <br/>Ostap Onistrat, 21, was killed in a drone strike not far from where we speak, a couple of days before the counter-offensive began. He'd been in the army a year. <br/>His father is still in the throes of grief. \"A kamikaze drone flew to them and in fact hit him directly. It was impossible to recognise him. He was buried in a closed coffin,\" Sgt Onistrat says.<br/>How does he go on, I ask. \"I made a commitment. You know, we're here to win. Not to sit back, not to escape. I just think that every person here must do their job professionally. There is nothing heroic in it. I just have to finish this job.\"<br/>When I ask if he's looking for revenge, he replies firmly: \"Revenge is a sin.<br/>\"My task is to bring this story to an end. I want to take part in the victory parade. I want us to win, and I want to lose fewer people.\"<br/>We leave the front, the offensive still under way. Later, I received a message telling me they'd taken the Russian positions.<br/>Returning to the command post, Sgt Onistrat's car escorting us swerves and comes to a sudden stop. He, along with others, quickly exits the vehicle. I wonder if we too need to take cover.<br/>Then I see what's caught their attention - cherry trees. <br/>Like kids, they laugh carefree for a moment as they grab handfuls of the dark red fruit from the shady branches, as artillery and mortar fire continues to hammer Russian positions on the hillside.<br/>Follow Quentin Sommerville on Twitter.<br/>The making of a young Hero of Ukraine<br/>Quentin Sommerville on Bakhmut's frontline - 500m from Russians<br/>Ukraine mothers go behind enemy lines to save stolen children<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Ukraine also appeared lukewarm.<br/>The conflict has led to a shortage of grain and fertiliser in many African countries, which import the commodities from Ukraine and Russia respectively. This has led to a spike in food prices around the world, especially in Africa.<br/>The Africa Development Bank says the war is directly responsible for a shortage of about 30 million tonnes of grain on the continent. <br/>President Putin has been threatening to not renew a deal to let Ukrainian grain ships headed for Africa pass through Russian-controlled ports on the Black Sea.<br/>It's not the first time Mr Putin has threatened to do this, but if he follows through this time, it could exacerbate food shortages on the continent - which Africa leaders are keen to avoid at all costs. Although it is thought unlikely Mr Putin will deliver on his threat because he needs African countries on his side to avoid diplomatic isolation.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Ukraine-Russia African peace mission: What\u2019s next?<br/>Alongside raising international awareness about the economic impact the war has had on the continent, African leaders were confronted by further calls to condemn the invasion. <br/>Ukraine's leader argued that condemning Moscow was needed to send a clear message to the Russian people that their isolation on the international stage was a result of their president's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>Both Uganda and South Africa, which formed part of the African delegation, are seen as aligned with Russia's position. Last month the US ambassador accused South Africa of violating neutrality and supplying weapons to Russia, violating its non-aligned status. South Africa denied this.<br/>It is also unclear if South Africa would hand Mr Putin over to the International Criminal Court, should he visit South Africa during the upcoming Brics summit in August.<br/>The key aim of the trip was to help strengthen the case for a negotiated diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine, and in that respect, it has not been a success. <br/>Both Ukraine and Russia reiterated before and after the African peace mission that they would not come to the negotiating table without certain basic preconditions. <br/>For Ukraine, it wants its borders as they were in 1991 to be reinstated. This would mean Russia withdrawing from all the territories it has seized from Ukraine in the past decade, including the Crimean Peninsula. This is something the Kremlin is deeply opposed to, arguing instead that for negotiations to take place, Kyiv would have to accept its country's \"new territorial reality\".<br/>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday said that talks with the Africa delegation would continue.<br/>Despite failing to bring the two sides of the conflict together, Mr Ramaphosa argues that his delegation opened the door for future talks. <br/>Given his problems at home, including crumbling infrastructure, regular blackouts and growing discontent with his government, Mr Ramaphosa may have been seeking to play up a win on the international stage. <br/>Unfortunately for him, this peace mission has not delivered that win.<br/>Why African leaders are travelling to Ukraine<br/>Putin - South Africa's big headache<br/>Why Russia's invasion of Ukraine still divides Africa<br/>Why is South Africa's navy joining exercises with Russia?<br/>Focus on Africa podcast<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Neither are coastguard and military vessels which do not have to share their location. <br/>Frontex, the EU's border force, says it first spotted the migrant boat at around 08:00 GMT on Tuesday and informed the Greek authorities. <br/>Alarm Phone, an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea, say they received a call at 12:17 GMT saying the boat was in distress. <br/>We have used video and photographs authenticated by BBC Verify, as well as court records and shipping logs, to analyse the movement of vessels in the area in the following hours. <br/>The Marine Traffic animation shows a ship called the Lucky Sailor abruptly turning north at 15:00 GMT.<br/>The owner of the Lucky Sailor gave the BBC their timeline of events and confirmed it had been asked by the Coastguard to approach the migrant boat and give food and water. <br/>About half-an-hour later at 15:35 GMT, the coastguard helicopter found the migrant boat. Authorities have continued to claim it was on a steady course at the time. <br/>But two-and-a-half hours later at around 18:00 GMT, another vessel, the Faithful Warrior, travelled to the same area and also gave supplies to the boat.<br/>The owners of Faithful Warrior referred us to the investigating authorities. <br/>Video has emerged - reportedly shot from the Faithful Warrior - claiming to show supplies being delivered to the migrant ship via a rope in the water. No other ships can be seen. <br/>BBC Verify checked it and found the vessel - which is not moving in the footage - matched the shape of the migrant ship seen in photos and the weather conditions were a match for those reported at the time. It's not known exactly when this video was filmed. <br/>Between 19:40 until 22:40, Greek officials originally claimed the boat was keeping a \"steady course and speed\".<br/>Their initial statement claimed they observed from a discreet distance, but a close-up image they later published - from this time-period - suggests the migrant boat is not going anywhere. <br/>A government spokesperson later said the coastguard had attempted to board the boat to assess the danger but that those on board removed a rope that had been attached and did not want help. <br/>All of the shipping activity of the previous seven hours was focused around one specific spot, suggesting the migrant boat had hardly moved. <br/>The scale of the animated map suggests it travelled less than a few nautical miles, which may be expected of a stricken vessel buffeted by the wind and the waves in the deepest part of the Mediterranean Sea.<br/>The actions of people in distress, rocking the vessel, would also have contributed any movement.<br/>During this time period,  Greek officials have insisted it was not in trouble and was instead safely on its way to Italy and so the coastguard didn't attempt a rescue. <br/>At 23:00, the boat sank with hundreds on board and the tracking animation shows a frenzy of ships coming to help. <br/>This included the Celebrity Beyond from which footage of the aftermath of the disaster was filmed and later sent to the BBC.<br/>A luxury yacht, the Mayan Queen, is then instructed to help take some of the 104 survivors ashore.  <br/>Those rescued reached the safety at the port of Kalamata but left behind a series of troubling questions about the whole Greek response.<br/>Additional reporting by Josh Cheetham, Daniele Palumbo and Frey Lindsay.<br/>Read more about BBC Verify: Explaining the 'how' - the launch of BBC Verify<br/>Capsized boat had 100 children in hold, BBC told<br/>Up to 500 missing in migrant boat disaster - UN<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

A small rise in percentage terms can still have a significant effect on people's finances.<br/>If a first-time buyer had a mortgage on the same property, that would take up 26% of pay, it said.<br/>The chunk of income taken up by rent varies in different regions. Even in London, where rent has previously taken up a bigger proportion of wages, the cost still accounts for 40% of gross earnings - the highest in the UK.<br/>Rents have been rising significantly for the last year. Although those on a fixed rent would not have seen a difference, those signing up to new contracts, or moving to a different property are likely to have seen big increases.<br/>The pressure of rising mortgage rates faced by landlords, as well as higher demand for properties than the number made available, have combined to raise the costs for tenants.<br/>The typical rise has been at more than 10%, compared with a year earlier, for 15 months in a row.<br/>In April, rent in London was 13.5% higher than a year ago, in Scotland it was 13.1% higher, and the North West of England saw a 10.5% increase.<br/>\"The impact of higher rents is not uniform with those on low incomes bearing the brunt, with increasing signs of stress,\" Mr Donnell said.<br/>Those trying to move from renting to buying their own home also face greater difficulty in securing a mortgage. Financial information service Moneyfacts said the number of deals available for someone offering a 5% deposit was down from 347 at the start of June last year to 199 now.<br/>There's more on your renting rights and where to go for help here.<br/>Mr Ward is among those renters feeling the squeeze, even though he is in a relatively well-paid job.<br/>He said he and his girlfriend's \u00a31,750 a month budget was regarded as low by agents, so they felt they were being priced out of London.<br/>He said that the situation was all the more \"absurd\" because of the competition for properties. The couple are now considering getting a visa to work overseas, for a better quality of life.<br/>One of the major reasons for higher rents is that there are lots of tenants chasing a smaller number of properties to rent.<br/>Zoopla said that there are 20% to 40% fewer homes to rent in most regions than there were before the pandemic. Meanwhile there are many more tenants than has been seen on average over the last five years.<br/>This was likely to become more acute as demand traditionally picks up during the summer months.<br/>Edinburgh and Glasgow feature high on the rental league table, partly because they score highly on quality of life and strong job markets, but there's more going on behind those numbers.<br/>The cities' universities have gone on a recruiting spree for foreign students, putting pressure on the rental market.<br/>And the alliance of SNP with Scottish Green ministers in the Scottish government have risked distorting the market with rent controls. <br/>A freeze in rents and evictions was introduced last September and lasted until March. Also to help households facing rising costs, there's now a 3% cap on rent increases until next March. Further and more permanent rent controls are expected in Holyrood legislation later this year, being drawn up by Green MSP and minister for tenants' rights Patrick Harvie.<br/>However, there is no constraint on the rents at which landlords can advertise new tenancies. So according to property professionals, newly-advertised rents have risen, as landlords seek to protect their income against the impact of future constraints once tenants have moved in.<br/>Zoopla's rental sector survey, published every three months, tracks the rents that landlords request when listing a property, but analysts also adjust the numbers to reflect the rent that is eventually agreed.<br/>Homeowners have been hit by rising interest, and mortgage rates, and that has spilled over into the buy-to-let market - which often sees even higher mortgage rates.<br/>Up to a third of landlords who have hefty mortgages are facing the biggest impact of rising interest rates, which are going up further than previously expected.<br/>Last week estate agency Savills said landlords were making their lowest profits for 16 years as interest rates rose.<br/>In a recent report, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said that higher rates, and stricter laws, were pushing some landlords to consider selling up. That would create a further squeeze on availability and could, in turn, increase the cost of renting further.<br/>Are you a tenant with a view on the cost of rent?

But rates have climbed sharply again recently. <br/>A typical five-year fixed rate is now at 5.67% compared with last year's peak of 6.51%.<br/>Expectations that interest rates will stay higher for longer have been reflected in the funding cost of mortgages, hitting new borrowers, and those trying to remortgage.<br/>The interest rate for the UK government to borrow money over two years - a key influence on mortgage rates - has been rising sharply, and on Monday it hit 5% for the first time since 2008.<br/>Mortgage lenders have been pulling deals and putting up rates at short-notice, while some have been inundated with demand and so forced to pull or raise rates again.<br/>On Monday, TSB said it was withdrawing its mortgage range sold via brokers, and expected to re-price on Wednesday.<br/>More than 400,000 people will see their existing fixed deals end between July and September, a comparatively high number. Many face the prospect of having to budget for monthly repayments that are hundreds of pounds more expensive than they have become accustomed to.<br/>The Bank of England's base rate, set by its Monetary Policy Committee and currently at 4.5%, will be reviewed on Thursday and is widely expected to increase for the 13th time in a row. <br/>But at the weekend, a former deputy governor of the Bank, Sir Howard Davies, argued that it should \"wait and see\" to see the full effect of the rate rises made so far.<br/>\"We have a mortgage market where most people are on a fixed rate - when you put up interest rates you only have an impact on the small number of people paying the variable rate and on the people whose fixed rate happens to come up for renewal,\" he told the BBC.<br/>\"So it's arguable the interest rate rises we've already seen have not yet fed fully through into the impact onto consumer spending.\" <br/>A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive.<br/>At this rate, your payments could change by\u2026<br/>\n                            monthly change<br/>to<br/>\n                            monthly total<br/><br/><br/>The information you provided on your monthly payments would not be sufficient to pay off your mortgage within the number of years given.<br/>This calculator does not constitute financial advice.

The annual inflation rate was 8.7% in April, still well above the Bank's 2% target.<br/>By raising interest rates, the Bank expects people to have less money to spend and buy fewer things, which should help stop prices rising as quickly.<br/>However, it also makes it harder for firms to borrow money and expand.<br/>The latest official inflation data will be published on Wednesday.<br/>Read more here<br/>How have you been affected by rising mortgage costs?

A huge margin of users voted for r/pics to \"only allow images of John Oliver looking sexy\", with 37,331 votes for and 2,239 votes against. Other subreddits saw similar results.<br/>And it isn't just John Oliver that Reddit has to contend with.<br/>Other subreddits are similarly remaining active while changing their communities to fit within Reddit's rules, with r/iPhone now dedicated to \"dashing images\" of Apple chief executive Tim Cook, and moderators of r/scams approving content deliberately slowly, taking up to 14 days to review a post rather than a few minutes.<br/>Reddit communities go dark in protest at changes<br/>Twitch scraps ad changes after streamers leave<br/>Social media platform Reddit files to go public<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The councils could then use that income to reduce council tax, pay for improved public services or simply provide rebates on energy bills.<br/>Labour says GB Energy could end up providing up to \u00a3600m per year to local councils to invest in green infrastructure and a further \u00a3400m annually in low interest loans for community projects.<br/>These community loans would be designed to ensure small projects could benefit from the expertise of GB Energy while also generating money for local areas.<br/>Sir Keir accused the Conservatives and the SNP of having abysmal records on renewables.<br/>He said Labour would introduce new rules on \"good work, decent pay and union recognition\" - and create a new incentive.<br/>This would be \"a British jobs bonus that will attract new investment, new jobs, new supply chains into our deprived industrial heartlands and will reward companies that back working people\".<br/>Offshore Energy UK's chief executive David Whitehouse told the BBC that Labour's plans to move away from the reliance of North Sea oil and gas \"would create a cliff edge\" deterring investment and heightening the risk of energy shortages.<br/>Mr Whitehouse said 180 of the North Sea's 283 active oil and gas fields were due to close by 2030, and new licences were \"essential\" or production would \"plummet\" and \"the UK and its skilled workforce will be exposed\".<br/>The GMB union said the UK was going to need oil and gas until 2050 and beyond, and that a ban on new licences \"ignores this reality\".<br/>But Philip Evans, of Greenpeace UK, said the idea that the plans would \"lead to an overnight shutdown of the industry\" was nonsense.<br/>Labour's opposition to new exploration licences represented \"genuine leadership\" he added, and the party was right \"to debunk scare stories being peddled by climate delayers\".<br/>Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, welcomed Labour's latest ideas but warned \"there can be no backsliding on pledges to stop new oil and gas extraction and invest in green growth\".<br/>Environmental groups are particularly vocal about their opposition to the proposed Rosebank development in the North Atlantic.<br/>Industry and government sources say the field could be approved by the UK government's North Sea Transition Authority within weeks.<br/>Norwegian state-controlled oil company Equinor said Rosebank could produce almost 70,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak.<br/>Sir Keir has held private talks with senior energy industry figures in the past week and previously gave direct assurances to Equinor that a Labour government would not revoke any licences.<br/>Instead the party says its focus is on delivering \"cheaper zero carbon power by 2030\" and its \"mission\" includes plans to attract and incentivise investment \"in the UK's industrial heartlands\".<br/>That is likely to provoke comparisons with the approach taken by the US Democratic president Joe Biden whose Inflation Reduction Act has been described by the UK Conservative government's Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch as \"protectionist\". <br/>The Scottish Conservatives' energy spokesman Liam Kerr described Labour's plans as \"ruinous\" for the UK's oil and gas industry, claiming they \"would throw up to 90,000 highly skilled workers in the North East under a bus pretty much overnight\".<br/>The Scottish government said it was committed to \"a planned and fair transition\" away from fossil fuels that did not imperil jobs.<br/>First Minister Humza Yousaf said Labour governments had squandered hundreds of billions of pounds of oil and gas revenues, and only invested a fraction in Scotland.<br/>\"I am not sure anybody will trust a Labour Party on the green economy just two weeks after they dump their \u00a328bn green prosperity fund,\" he added.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

That's \u00a3378 per month more, or nearly \u00a323,000 more over the five-year term.<br/>Mr Gove acknowledged people moving off fixed-rate deals faced \"significant increases\" along with broader cost-of-living pressures. <br/>But he said the best way to tackle this was to bring down inflation.<br/>A Treasury source added that a bailout for homeowners would be \"self-defeating\" because it would push up inflation and prompt the Bank of England to further raise interest rates.<br/>The Sunday Times reported that the Treasury has ruled out mortgage support for this and other reasons. Instead, it will ask banks to do more to stop people losing their homes.<br/>David Husbands, 43, a property valuer from Chester-le-Street in County Durham, said his rising mortgage payments were \"crippling\" him.<br/>His payments have gone from about \u00a3300 per month in early 2022 to more than \u00a3600.<br/>\"Because interest rates have gone sky high I'm lucky if I'm left with \u00a3100 to live off at the end of each month,\" he said. \"I've had to take on extra casual work elsewhere.\"<br/>He is finding the situation \"exhausting\" and \"very stressful\", finishing work at 5:30pm, then doing gigs as a casual DJ until midnight.<br/>He fell into negative equity during the financial crash of 2008, and doesn't have enough money to renovate the house to sell it to \"at least break even\".<br/>David and his husband have also put adoption plans on hold.<br/>\"Right now we don't feel confident to be able to give a child a secure, safe and comfortable home,\" he said.<br/>The idea of the government providing help for mortgage customers is more nuanced than the furlough jobs scheme or recent Energy Price Guarantee.<br/>While those were universal, less than 30% of UK households have a mortgage.<br/>Providing support for them risks alienating older voters who own their homes outright, and younger people who cannot even afford to buy.<br/>That is why the government is not entirely ruling out some kind of support for homeowners, but sticking to its key pledge to bring inflation down to below 5%.<br/>In theory that would ease everyday costs for every household.<br/>However, ministers are desperate to get the economy firing, and if millions of people soon have to pay hundreds of pounds a month extra in their mortgage costs, that is money which they won't spend on eating out, buying goods or holidaying.<br/>With a growing number of mortgage customers now getting into arrears, and repossessions increasing sharply in recent months, it is a worrying time for millions of households, with no easy answers.<br/>Read more here<br/>Will soaring mortgage costs push the UK into recession?<br/>Remortgaging costs to go up average of \u00a32,900<br/>Average two-year mortgage rate close to 6%<br/>Five reasons why mortgages are getting us down<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

I felt embarrassed, I felt ashamed\"<br/>A former Barclays trader jailed in connection with a $9bn interest rate rigging scandal has said telling his father about it was \"the hardest day of my life\".<br/>\"I burst into tears. I felt like I'd let him down,\" Peter Johnson told the BBC, as he struggled to compose himself.<br/>In an emotional interview, Johnson revealed the devastation caused not only to his life but that of his family by what is now regarded by some MPs as a state-level cover-up, followed by a whole series of miscarriages of justice. <br/>Jailed for four years for \"manipulating\" interest rates, Johnson was released in 2018 after serving two years.<br/>He was later revealed to be one of the original whistleblowers of the scandal.<br/>Speaking for the first time since his release, he says when he was put on gardening leave by Barclays in 2011, he descended into depression and avoided being seen in the streets near his house or informing his family about his predicament.<br/>In 2012, Johnson was sacked by Barclays after more than 30 years' service and faced the risk of prosecution by the US Department of Justice (DoJ), which could lead to up to 30 years in a US prison.<br/>\"[When I woke up] I'd have about five seconds when I thought all was well with the world. And then I'd realise that it wasn't. And I'd go around all day with a sort of a weight pressing against my chest. I'd wait for six o'clock before I started self-medicating with alcohol. I had panic attacks,\" he says.<br/>\"I spent years trying to suppress my emotions because I don't want to get upset and bitter and twisted and everything else.<br/>\"[But] this is too important to forget - to sweep under the carpet. People need to know and once they know the full facts, they can make their judgements on whether what people did was wrong or right.\"<br/>Such was the psychological pressure on him that when he was charged with a crime in the UK, rather than the US, it came as a relief.<br/>\"It was ridiculous. There I was feeling relieved that I was going to be charged with a crime. And it was good! I mean, it's just stupid. It just shows how mad things were for me at the time.\"<br/>Johnson's lawyer Tony Woodcock, now retired but then a senior partner at prominent white-collar crime specialists Stephenson Harwood, sees his former client's prosecution as an outrage. <br/>Senior MPs including former Brexit secretary David Davis and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell have come to share that view after reading a book I have written exposing the scandal.<br/>\"In over 30 years in practice I never had a case in which I felt so powerless and bullied and where the smell of politics was so rancid. Hopefully all the evil lurking in the mud will be found out,\" Mr Woodcock says.<br/>One reason he feels so strongly is that Johnson, who worked as a cash trader for Barclays from 1981 to 2011, was the original whistleblower of the interest rate rigging scandal, in which banks paid nearly $9bn in fines and 37 traders and brokers were prosecuted for \"manipulating\" Libor and Euribor, two benchmarks that track the cost of borrowing cash.<br/>From 2007 to 2009, Johnson repeatedly alerted the US central bank and the Bank of England to other banks publishing false, low estimates of the interest rates they'd have to pay to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars at a time - so-called \"lowballing\".<br/>He tried to publish higher, more honest estimates, but kept getting instructions from above to be no more honest than any other bank. Leaked audio recordings indicate the pressure on Johnson to lie came first from the board of Barclays, then from the Bank of England, then from the UK government. <br/>Evidence revealed in the book indicates that then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown's head of policy, the late Sir Jeremy Heywood, was one senior Whitehall figure who wanted Barclays to lower its Libor estimates of the cost of borrowing dollars.<br/>\"I thought they were wrong,\" says Johnson. \"But I didn't feel I had any choice but to go along with them. You're being asked by the UK government and the supreme financial establishment in the land to do something. It's very, very difficult to say, 'No, stuff you!'\"<br/>Yet four years later, on 27 June 2012, suppressed anger towards the banks at the lack of accountability for the 2008 banking crisis exploded into the media when Barclays was fined a record \u00a3290m by US and UK regulators for rigging interest rates. <br/>Both Labour and Conservative MPs angrily condemned 14 unnamed traders - which Johnson knew included himself. <br/>\"When something like that happens to a major corporation, there's usually a scapegoat. And I sort of felt that maybe it might be me.<br/>\"Quite justifiably, the public was outraged at what they saw as excesses in the banking industry. And they wanted heads on a pike. And I became one of the heads,\" he says, adding: \"I think they could have chosen better ones.\"<br/>Criminal authorities on both sides of the Atlantic, co-operating with lawyers working for Barclays, lined him up for prosecution. <br/>He was not prosecuted for lowballing, but for manipulating rates on a much smaller scale by accepting requests from traders between 2005 and 2007 to nudge his Libor rates up or down very slightly.<br/>In 2014, Johnson became the first banker to plead guilty to manipulating interest rates. But it was only because he felt the odds were against him and he had no choice. Barclays had cut him off from any financial support with his legal fees.<br/>Because of the very high cost of defending himself, he feared he might lose his home, his savings and therefore his ability to support his children and grandchildren, even if he were found innocent.<br/>\"I didn't feel as if I'd done anything wrong. But I could see the way the whole thing was going and it didn't look good for me.\"<br/>Johnson, a 68-year-old grandfather, was sentenced in 2016 to four years and jailed alongside three other Barclays traders.<br/>His first jail was HMP Wandsworth, which he describes as \"pretty basic, pretty horrible\".<br/>\"There was a shortage of prison officers... and there are some times when we were not let out of our cells, apart from for 10 minutes to get our meals, for 54 hours at a time.\"<br/>He was later transferred to Ford open prison, where he decided to improve his fitness by walking around the perimeter of the prison, clocking up 6,000 miles and raising \u00a33,000 for charity.<br/>In the US, all 19 convictions for interest rate rigging are being overturned at the request of the DoJ - the same body that originally declared conduct like Johnson's to be illegal - following a US appeal court ruling that the prosecution case was misconceived. <br/>The trader requests that Johnson was jailed for, it found, were not illegal - and didn't even break any rules. Many of those convictions arose from guilty pleas, made under the threat of prosecution in the US, which the DoJ no longer views as sound. <br/>The UK is now the only country where making or accepting the requests is viewed as criminal. David Davis, John McDonnell and other MPs, peers and senior lawyers have written to the Times saying the cases must be sent back to the courts. <br/>\"In my most optimistic view, I would like my guilty plea to be revoked. I'd like to basically have my reputation restored. And I'd like senior people to be held accountable,\" says Johnson.<br/>Asked who they are, his reply is simple: \"The board of Barclays Bank, the Bank of England and the government of the UK.\"<br/>Barclays declined to comment for this article.<br/>A spokesperson for the Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted Johnson, said its cases were based on evidence. It said nine bank traders knowingly rigged rates for their own benefit. \"Separate juries and the Court of Appeal agreed they committed a crime.\"<br/>A Bank of England spokesperson said: \"The Bank fully co-operated with the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into Libor manipulation, responding to all requests for information and documents.\"<br/>The Treasury said in a statement: \"The government did not seek to influence individual bank Libor submissions.\"<br/>Follow Andy Verity on Twitter @andyverity<br/>Interest rate 'rigging' evidence 'covered up' by banks<br/>The whistleblowing bankers who were sent to jail<br/>Bank implicated in Libor rigging<br/>Libor traders jailed in rigging trial<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

She is on a variable rate mortgage which is almost entirely interest-only to keep costs down,<br/>The 61-year-old, who is disabled, said she was now having to work Saturday mornings on top of her full-time hours as an administrator to pay the bills.  <br/>\"I am existing - it's almost like a form of slavery. I've had late and missed payments, as well, which has impacted my credit score, so that's making it hard for me. I just keep hoping the interest rates will keep down, but I don't think that would be case.\" <br/>The think tank said about three-fifths of the increase in annual mortgage payments was yet to be passed on to households, as borrowers move off existing fixed-rate deals and on to new ones. <br/>This was expected to deliver a \"rolling living standards hit\" to millions of households in the run-in to the next general election, it said. <br/>In December the Bank of England said about four million UK households would face higher mortgage payments in 2023, with the average monthly bill rising by \u00a3250.<br/>But that included households on tracker and variable rate mortgages, and the prediction was made at a time when the Bank of England's base rate was lower.<br/>The former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has put the high inflation rates down to Brexit, saying it had triggered a \"unique\" adjustment that could take years to unwind. <br/>He told the Daily Telegraph that he had \"laid out in advance\" his concerns about the UK leaving the EU, which would lead to \"a weaker pound, higher inflation and weaker growth.\"<br/>Comparing the current situation with 1989, when interest rates reached almost 15%, the Resolution Foundation predicted this year's rate rises would increase the cost of a typical mortgage by 3% of a typical household income, outstripping the 2.4% increase seen then. <br/>But the organisation said the current mortgage crunch was less widespread than in previous shocks, which was \"better news for the government\". <br/>In 1989, although inflation was lower at 5.5%, nearly 40% of households owned a home with a mortgage and were therefore exposed to rising costs.<br/>Now, with more older people owning their homes outright and fewer young people owning property at all, the share of households with a mortgage has fallen below 30%.<br/>The Resolution Foundation's Simon Pittaway said: \"Market expectations that interest rates are going to rise even higher, and stay higher for longer, are having a major effect on the mortgage market. <br/>\"Of course, market expectations can be wrong, and rate rises may not turn out to be as bad as feared.\"<br/>Around 7.5 million people with a mortgage are expected to see their repayments rise by 2026, the think tank said. <br/>A Treasury spokesperson said the government knows it is \"a concerning time for mortgage holders,\" but lenders were required to offer tailored support to those struggling with mortgages by the Financial Conduct Authority.<br/>\"We continue to support mortgage holders through the Support for Mortgage Interest scheme.<br/>\"Behind this though is global inflation, continuing to eat away at incomes around the world, which is why the single biggest thing we can do to help families is to halve the rate this year.<br/>\"We are also supportive of the Bank of England in their independent decisions on interest rates, and continue to provide around \u00a33,300 per household this year and next to help with rising costs.\"<br/>But Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"These findings press home again how important economic stability and resilience are, and how badly the Conservatives have failed on both of these.<br/> \"Over 13 years, the Tories have weakened our economy and then crashed it, leaving working people paying the price for years to come. <br/> \"Labour will bring financial and economic security back, so that families are not constantly on a cliff edge, and so that we can urgently grow our economy to grab hold of opportunities of the future.\"  <br/>Have you been affected by rising mortgage costs?

And then the contacts come back and say, 'Sorry, we got that one wrong,'\" Mr Bailey said.<br/>Tesco's Mr Murphy said he believed the Bank of England had been unfair in blaming supermarkets for inflation remaining at a high level.<br/>Mr Murphy said the retailer had \"led the way\" in cutting prices on staple goods such as milk, pasta and cooking oil.<br/>He added there were several factors contributing to food inflation, but when commodity prices have come down, the \"grocery industry has been very quick to pass on those savings to consumers\".<br/>The Tesco boss said prices were \"unlikely\" to return to the levels they were prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, known as the bread basket of Europe, but pointed out that wages were \"materially higher than they were two years ago\".<br/>\"What's important here is the purchasing power of the family,\" he added. \"That's really where we should be focused on improving people's purchasing power so that they can continue to feed their families and live a decent life.\"<br/>UK supermarkets have previously said there is typically a three to nine-month lag to see price falls reflected in shops.<br/>Last month, Sainsbury's hit back after accusations of bolstering profits at a time when many households are struggling with higher prices.<br/>Mr Murphy's comments came as Tesco released its latest trading update, showing that in the three months to the end of May sales in the UK were up 9% from a year earlier to \u00a310.8bn.<br/>Charles Allen, a retail analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, told the BBC's Today programme that inflation was a \"huge factor\" in Tesco's latest figures.<br/>\"The top commodity prices are starting to fall but it's important to remember that lower inflation doesn't mean deflation. It doesn't mean prices dropping, it just means prices going up less fast.\"<br/>On a call with reporters, Mr Murphy also said Tesco's board had \"acted in the best interests\" of the company regarding the departure of its chairman John Allan.<br/>Mr Allan announced he was stepping down last month following allegations over his conduct.<br/>He has strongly denied three of four claims made against him. <br/>\"It was a difficult decision but at the same time, I think it coincides with the fact that the search for a new chairman was already well under way,\" Mr Murphy said.<br/>Sainsbury's and Asda told not to block rival stores<br/>Supermarkets probed over food and fuel prices<br/>Plans for supermarket price cap on basic food<br/>Food prices 'worryingly high' as sugar and milk soar<br/>Sainsbury\u2019s boss denies profiting from high prices<br/>Father and son among Titanic sub missing as search continues<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Now it is one of the world's most powerful technology companies, with an annual revenue of $200bn (\u00a3158.2bn). <br/>It is best known for making more than half of Apple's products - from iPhones to iMacs - but it also counts Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Amazon among its clients.<br/>For decades, it has thrived on a playbook perfected by multinational corporations - they design products in the US, manufacture them in China and then sell them to the world. That is how it grew from a small component-making business to the consumer electronics giant it is today.<br/>But as global supply chains adjust to souring ties between Washington and Beijing, Foxconn finds itself in an unenviable spot - caught between the world's two biggest economies, the very nations that have powered its growth until now. <br/>The US and China are at loggerheads over many things, from trade to the war in Ukraine. But one of the biggest potential flashpoints is Taiwan, where Foxconn is headquartered.<br/>Taiwan has been a thorny issue for a long time but Chinese leader Xi Jinping's repeated pledges of \"reunification\" have upset the uneasy status quo. Meanwhile, the US, under President Joe Biden, has been more vocal in its support for Taiwan in case of an attack.<br/>Some US voices have crossed China's red line, calling for independence, although the White House has reaffirmed its position that it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei.<br/>There are hopes of a thaw with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting China this weekend. But there are also fears of a conflict - one US general has estimated it could happen as soon as the next few years.<br/>\"The United States and China are engaged in what we see as strategic competition,\" said Shihoko Goto, the deputy director for the Asia programme at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.<br/>\"Foxconn wants to do business with both, but there can only be one winner.\"<br/>But Mr Liu does not think it is that simple. For one, he said, Foxconn's business model, which relies on US designs and Chinese manufacturing, is far from over.<br/>\"We hire a lot of workers and most countries, including China, want to support their workers,\" Mr Liu said, adding that the Chinese government wants companies like Foxconn to keep going because of the huge number of jobs they create.<br/>Are rising tensions putting pressure on the model? \"So far? We haven't seen it,\" he told us.<br/>But the West and its allies have called for countries and companies to \"de-risk\" from China - a long-term shift to curb global reliance on China that is yet to play out.<br/>When asked if that was impacting business, Mr Liu responded cautiously. <br/>Some overseas clients had pushed to move production out of China, he said, but this was their decision to make, not Foxconn's.<br/>\"They get the push from their government about de-risking, and then they will let us know.\"<br/>Geopolitics aside, Covid-19 is another reason companies might consider \"de-risking\" from China.<br/>A mix of harsh Covid policies, a lack of space for quarantine and the infectiousness of the Omicron variant led to protests and riots at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou - the world's biggest iPhone plant - in late 2022. Hundreds of workers, who feared the spread of the virus, fled the campus on foot.<br/>Mr Liu said the scenes that played out for the world to see were caused by a lack of transportation due to Beijing's unyielding zero-Covid policy.<br/>But when pressed further, he admitted that he should have handled things differently.<br/>\"If the same situation occurs again, I would stop production altogether,\" he said, reiterating that he would have made that decision even at the risk of irking clients like Apple.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory<br/>The company's success certainly rests on its impressive client base, but Foxconn is just as indispensable to those clients.<br/>To understand how essential it is to Apple, for instance, you just need to look at how much of the iPhone is made by Foxconn - around 60%, by some estimates. The factories in China make some of the most essential parts of the device - camera modules, connectors, even the back of the phone casing.<br/>That expertise is also what Mr Liu is hoping will fuel Foxconn's next big bet: electric cars.<br/>\"Look at this - this is a big iPhone, so we're very familiar with this,\" he said, pointing to a panel that controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in.<br/>Built for families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the shiny white SUV is one of several models manufactured by Foxconn. <br/>\"The reason why we think this is a great opportunity for us is that with the traditional gas engine, you have engines which are mostly mechanical. But with EVs, it's batteries and motors,\" he explains. <br/>That is a familiar language for a technology company like Foxconn, he added. <br/>Foxconn's hopes to capture about 5% of the global electric vehicle market in the next few years - an ambitious target given the firm has only made a handful of models so far. But it is a gamble that Mr Liu is confident will pay off.<br/>\"It doesn't make sense for you to make [EVs] in one place, so regionalised production for cars is very natural,\" he added. Foxconn car factories will be based in Ohio in the US, in Thailand, Indonesia and perhaps even in India, he said. <br/>For now, the company will keep focusing on what it does best - making electronic products for clients. But perhaps not too far in the future, Foxconn will do the same for clients with electric cars.<br/>Either way, with the foray into electric cars, Foxconn is diversifying not just production but also supply lines - both of which, Mr Liu believes, hold the key to the company's future.<br/>iPhone maker hikes pay ahead of new model launch<br/>iPhone maker sees revenue slump as demand weakens<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Last year, it resisted calls to cut ties with its controversial star Joe Rogan, who reportedly received $200m in 2020 for giving the streamer exclusive listening rights.<br/>But Mr Rogan's show offers several multi-hour episodes each week, which reportedly command an average audience of 11 million people. <br/>Meghan by contrast delivered just 12 episodes of her Archetypes podcast last year.<br/>The joint statement announcing the split said the Sussexes and Spotify were \"proud\" of the material they made together. <br/>And a string of accolades showed why.<br/>Archetypes' debut last year hit the top of Spotify's charts in six markets, including the US and UK. The show, in which Meghan interviewed fellow celebrities such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling, also won a People's Choice Award.<br/>But crisis communications guru Mark Borkowski says the show may not have been compelling enough when Spotify reviewed the numbers.  <br/>\"It's always about the content.... clearly there hasn't been a big enough audience for it,\" he says. \"If you can't deliver your fee, no one's going to pay it.\"<br/>Mr Borkowski says there is little doubt that the duke and duchess still have value as a media brand. But it may not be what it once was. <br/>Polling for Newsweek earlier this year suggested the couple's popularity in the US suffered following the publicity blitz surrounding their Netflix documentary series and the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare. \"The more Prince Harry and Meghan say, the less Americans like them,\" was Newsweek's headline.<br/>Mr Borkowski says the pair, who stepped back as working royals in 2020, will have to \"think hard\" about what they can offer in whatever they do next.<br/>\"It's a thread that's been pulled out of the brand,\" he says of the Spotify break-up. \"If they want to stop it unravelling they've really got to think hard. The biggest question is are they going to learn from this setback or are they going to ignore it as just a blip.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the Hollywood talent agency now representing the duchess told the Wall Street Journal this week: \"Meghan is continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform.\"<br/>Max Willens, senior analyst at Insider Intelligence, says Spotify is not the only tech giant that spent heavily in recent years to sign talent who failed to live up to the promise implied by the money they commanded. <br/>Those heady days ended last year, as economic sentiment soured and share prices sank. <br/>But shares in Spotify, which continues to add users and has seen its catalogue of podcasts jump to more than five million, are up nearly 90% this year, as investors welcome Mr Ek's promises to stay focused on \"efficiency\". <br/>In announcing the \"next phase\" for its podcasting business this month, the company signalled it would embrace lower-cost, third party creators, while pushing investment towards \"always on\" programming. <br/>\"The platforms that have gotten into [podcasting] had to take some time to figure out what constituted a good investment,\" Mr Willens says. He calls the decision by Spotify and the duke and duchess to part ways an \"understandable and natural part of that that process\". <br/>\"Those were big, big deals designed to generate buzz and grab headlines and they accomplished that. Whether they made good long-term economic sense is a different question.\"<br/>Spotify podcast deal with Harry and Meghan ends<br/>Where do Harry and Meghan get their money?<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,\" she says.<br/>Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal.<br/>However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies.<br/>\"We are at a real inflection point,\" she says. \"The showdown is here.\"<br/>Treat cryptocurrency as gambling, MPs say<br/>US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens<br/>NatWest limits crypto transfers over scam fears<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

A love of music has shaped both her life and her approach to design, she says.<br/>\"This morning I went up to my design studio and they were playing heavy rock. I looked up at the girls and said, 'Soz, I'm changing it.'\"<br/>Choosing the right music to create the right \"buzz\" for clients who come to visit her west London studio is of the utmost importance to Kelly Hoppen.<br/>Music sets the mood for them, but it also helps her get creative. \"It has to be a certain music for me to get into the zone to design,\" she explains.<br/>In fact, it's often through discussion of music that the decisive creative breakthroughs with clients are made.<br/>\"I say to them, 'If you wanted your room to sound like a piece of music, what would it be?'\" she says. \"Some don't understand the question, but others say, 'Oh, 100%, Say A Little Prayer for You by Burt Bacharach.' And I get that! <br/>\"I can't explain why, but music is design to me.\"<br/>In a career that spans five decades, Hoppen, 63, has established herself as one of the UK's best-known interior designers. She is famed for her neutral palette, Zen-like greys which are meant to create a relaxing ambience. <br/>Many of her celebrity customers have been musicians, including Victoria Beckham, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and, most recently, Boy George.<br/>Her job is to figure out what they really want, which isn't always straightforward. Boy George visited her home and explained the decor he was after.<br/>\"I said, 'I'm absolutely convinced you don't [want that],\" recalls Hoppen.<br/>But by speaking to him she found out the deeper feelings he was looking for, which gave her clues on how to express his personality in home decor - which is very different to his flamboyant stage persona, she points out.<br/>It's the part of the job she loves, getting into a client's head like a psychologist, she says.<br/>The language of music is part of her method for \"getting the information\" she needs.<br/>Hoppen was born in South Africa, where her mother is from, but with her British father the family moved to London when she was two.<br/>They went back to visit her grandparents during holidays, and her grandmother's elegant home was another design inspiration for her.<br/>In the mid-1970s, aged 16, she decided to \"run away\" back to South Africa on her own. <br/>Her parents had divorced and she was living with her father after falling out with her mother. When her father died unexpectedly at the age of 48, the huge shock was the trigger for her to go.<br/>Back in apartheid South Africa she befriended the musical group The Pacific Express and toured with them. The group contained both black and Indian members. She was breaking apartheid laws by mixing with them, and found herself in jail on one occasion as a result.<br/>She had known the risks, but the music drew her in.<br/>The experience left her \"heartbroken and disgusted\" at what South Africa was like under apartheid so she did not go back.<br/>More CEO Secrets interviews:<br/>Instead, she channelled her passion for music into interior design, starting her company in her teens without qualifications, and growing it organically, one client at a time.<br/>Hoppen's understated look for interiors has appealed to clients who specialise in luxury environments, whether it is boutique hotels, cruise ships or airlines looking to please first-class customers. <br/>She says it's a reputation she has played along with, though she's not averse to a splash of colour. (\"But in my own home? Nope.\") <br/>Apart from her design consultancy, her business empire also includes her best-selling books, which explain some of her design secrets.<br/>The jobs that come into her studio tend to be from high net-worth clients, or companies that cater to them. Her customers have not been particularly affected by the cost of living crisis, she says.<br/>She is aware of \"the divide\" that exists between her clientele's design needs, and the day-to-day concerns of most people.<br/>But she is equally passionate about improving home design for those on smaller budgets, she says, and has built a large following on Instagram, sharing ideas about how to do it.<br/>Interior design doesn't have to involve spending money, she says. You can create impact by small things like changing cushions, or rehanging pictures.<br/>\"I'm such a geek about it, if I could go into everyone's homes and help with the changes, I would. I'd love to be that magician.\"<br/>People have come to appreciate their homes more now as \"sanctuaries\" since the pandemic and lockdowns, Hoppen believes.<br/>And one thing that music and good interior design at home have in common, she's realised, is that they both have the power to influence your mood and have a positive effect on your mental health.<br/>You can follow business reporter Dougal Shaw on LinkedIn<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

And she sells her own Isabella Vrana label.<br/>Over her eight years in the business, Ms Vrana says she has seen huge changes in demand for second-hand clothes. <br/>\"It wasn't such a normal thing when I started so I've definitely seen an increase in people buying second hand to try and be more sustainable,\" she says.<br/>Plus there's the quality of well-made vintage clothes. \"These items are lasting decades and they're being worn as well. Take a vintage pair of jeans - I've got jeans with dry cleaning labels from the 1990s and they're still going so strong,\" she says.<br/>\"I think people are realising that you might be investing a bit more of an upfront cost, but then it is really paying off long-term.\"<br/>Adam Jay, marketplace chief executive at the clothing resell app Vinted, says the growth in demand for second-hand clothing as been \"phenomenal\".<br/>Vinted now has over eight million registered members in the UK, up from 1.2 million in 2021.<br/>There are the obvious reasons why people are attracted to second-hand clothing. <br/>Buying new clothes and footwear can be expensive at a time when many people are struggling with the cost of living. <br/>The rate at which prices are rising for clothing and shoes hit 6.5% in the year to April, according to the Office for National Statistics.   <br/>Meanwhile, the fashion industry is responsible for generating between 8-10% of global emissions, according to the United Nations, from growing cotton to using oil to create synthetic materials such as polyester.<br/>But for fashion and sustainability vlogger Rosie Okotcha \"thrifted fashion is very cool now because its my personal style, no-one else can get it\".<br/>She credits TikTok and Instagram with driving the trend for second-hand clothing, in particular with \"Gen Z\" shoppers - that's people who were born in between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s.<br/>That is reflected in the sort of styles people are buying. <br/>According to Depop, \"Y2K\" is a popular trend on its app including oversized denim, colourful crochet and vintage t-shirts. There's also demand for one-of-a-kind and customised items, as well as clothing that is handmade or reworked from existing pieces.  <br/>But while the internet might be fuelling the trend, there is vintage fashion to be found in the High Street charity shop.<br/>Ms Okotcha says that part of her mission is to try to \"break down the stigma that there is something wrong with shopping second hand because it is actually really fantastic fun and great for the planet\".<br/>While it might seem inevitable that the popularity of apps might have ended up re-routing clothing donations away from the High Street, the Charity Retail Association (CRA) says that's not the case.<br/>Charity shop sales rose by 15.1% between January and March compared with the same three months last year.  <br/>\"There is plenty of second-hand clothing to go around, so we see the growth of online selling platforms as complementary to the work of charity shops,\" says the CRA.<br/>Ms Vrana agrees that there is plenty of room for competition, and she plans to continue.  <br/>\"There's definitely money to be made,\" she says. <br/>\"You can definitely support yourself through doing this full-time, which I'm really grateful for because sometimes it doesn't even feel like a job because I enjoy it so much.\" <br/>Shein faces US calls for probe into Uyghur claims<br/>Making prom affordable during cost of living crisis<br/>The apps getting your wardrobe back under control<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Savita Patel, a California-based independent journalist, speaks to those supporting and opposing the bill becoming a law.<br/>Sukhjinder Kaur*, a nurse at a hospital in California, works long and tiring hours serving patients. But whenever it's break time, things become oppressive. <br/>She is a Dalit (a community that is placed at the bottom of India's deeply discriminatory caste hierarchy) and says she often faces casteist insults from her South Asian colleagues.<br/>Dalit rights activists say scores of caste-oppressed Californians face housing, educational, professional, and social discrimination. <br/>In March, Senator Aisha Wahab, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party, authored and introduced the SB-403 bill -  legislation that seeks to add caste as a protected category in the state's anti-discrimination laws alongside gender, race, religion and disability.<br/>The bill was passed by the state's senate in May with a 34-1 vote. If it goes through in the state assembly, California will become the first US state to ban caste discrimination.<br/>\"Nurses from upper castes pass slurs about chamars [a pejorative term for Dalits] being dirty and polluting,\" says Ms Kaur, who is among those who are in favour of the law. <br/>In February, Seattle became the first city in the US - and outside South Asia - to outlaw caste discrimination, generating momentum for the legislation in California. It is being propelled by the same broad multi-faith, inter-caste, multi-racial coalition of over 40 American and international Dalit and human rights activists and organisations, led by California-based Equality Labs.<br/>California has a large South Asian diaspora and is home to some of the world's biggest tech companies.<br/>The state is home to more than half of the 500,000-plus Sikh population in the US and gurudwaras (Sikh temples) in California have been mobilising momentum to outlaw caste discrimination. <br/>Two of the community's largest advocacy groups - The Sikh Coalition and Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund - support the bill. Among Sikhs, it is the Ravidasia community - the largest Dalit community in the state with approximately 15,000-20,000 members - which is advocating for the bill at grassroots level.<br/>Renu Singh, who follows the Ravidasia tradition and is also a women's rights activist, has been urging women to speak about their own experiences of caste discrimination and those they see around them so that lawmakers understand the gravity of the issue.<br/>Data from an Equality Lab study shows that one in four caste-oppressed people from the South Asian American diaspora have faced physical and verbal violence; one in three has faced discrimination in education, and two out of three have experienced workplace discrimination.<br/>It was the first extensive study of caste distribution and its effects in the US and had over 1,500 respondents. The findings, published in 2018, say that those from \"lower castes\" fear retaliation and worry about being \"outed\" and hence \"hide their caste\".<br/>However, a significant section of the Indian diaspora rejects caste discrimination claims.<br/>Deepak Aldrin, a San Francisco-based Dalit activist is not in favour of the bill. \"I've lived here for 35 years. No Hindu has ever asked me what caste I belong to,\" he says.<br/>The bill is meeting strong opposition from many Indian-American individuals, religious and professional groups, who argue that even though it does not specifically name their religion, it will \"discriminate against Hindus, their places of worship and even make them less hiring worthy\". <br/>They say the existing laws in California are sufficient to address any discrimination and are mobilising the community to urge their lawmakers to disallow the legislation to proceed.<br/>Many businesses and Hindu temples under HinduPACT - an American Hindu grassroots advocacy initiative - have appealed to California lawmakers to reject the bill. Its convenor Ajay Shah says that the legislation is \"deeply flawed, ill-intentioned and targets children and youth from the Indian subcontinent and those who follow the Hindu dharma [Hinduism].\"<br/>Suhag Shukla, co-founder and executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, says this bill is already creating an \"undesirable\" awareness about caste. She says she has been \"hearing inappropriate queries from workers, especially in tech, who are being asked about their caste by non-South Asians\". She says if this becomes a pattern, it can be grounds for ethnicity-based harassment.<br/>The foundation has sued the state in a federal court for an \"unconstitutional definition of caste\" and has also challenged the addition of caste to its non-discrimination policy, saying that it \"singles out one community for ethnic profiling and additional policing\".<br/>Those opposing the bill say they are also perplexed as to how the state plans to identify an individual's caste since it's a very complex issue, .<br/>The bill, Ms Wahab explains, does not include details for identifying caste, similar to other protected categories.<br/>\"There is no language on how caste will be determined. This is simply an anti-discrimination bill. When somebody takes a matter up to the courts, that is usually when subject matter experts are engaged, the type of discrimination potentially that has taken place [is investigated].\"<br/>Ms Wahab says she has received \"death threats\" after proposing the bill. She now faces a recall campaign and a possible re-election. She adds that the \"visceral reaction\" to the bill is \"disheartening\" and has urged Californians to read the bill.<br/>\"Whether you're upper caste or lower caste, it does not matter, it will protect you as well,\" she says.<br/>*Some names have been changed to protect identity.<br/>BBC News India is now on YouTube.

It was made in a laboratory on an industrial estate just a few miles down the road.<br/>I'm in Huber's Butchery and Bistro in Singapore, which is the only restaurant in world to have so-called cultivated meat on the menu.<br/>Feedback from customers has been \"phenomenal\", according to the restaurant's owner.<br/>The meat's creator - California-based Eat Just - says it is ethical, clean and green - with no compromise on taste. Billions of dollars are being poured into the industry, but huge question marks hang over its viability as anything beyond a novelty.<br/>Ever since the first lab-grown burger - which cost a mere $330,000 (\u00a3263,400) to create - was unveiled in London in 2013, dozens of companies around the world have joined the race to bring affordable cultivated meat to the market.<br/>So far, only Eat Just has managed to get its product approved for public sale after regulators in Singapore - the only country in the world to allow lab-grown meat to be sold - gave its chicken the green light in December 2020.<br/>But it is still nowhere near being widely available. Cultivated chicken nuggets were briefly on the menu at a private members' club in 2021. <br/>That partnership lasted a few months and this year Huber's has started offering a chicken sandwich and a chicken pasta dish to the general public - albeit only once a week with limited dining slots available.<br/>\"Cultivated meat is real meat, but you don't have to slaughter an animal,\" says Josh Tetrick, chief executive of Eat Just, who spoke to the BBC from San Francisco. \"This way of eating makes sense for the future,\" he says.<br/>Unlike plant-based substitutes, cultivated meat is literally meat. The process involves extracting cells from an animal, which are then fed with nutrients such as proteins, sugars and fats.<br/>The cells are allowed to divide and grow, before being placed in a large steel bioreactor, which acts like a fermentation tank.<br/>After four to six weeks, the material is 'harvested' from the bioreactor. Some vegetable protein is added, then it is moulded, cooked and 3-D printed to give it the necessary shape and texture.<br/>The resulting strips of deep fried chicken on my plate of orecchiette pasta certainly tasted like the real deal, if a bit processed. Perhaps the sort of chicken you would eat in a fast-food restaurant.<br/>\"It's meat - it's perfect!\" says Caterina, an Italian student who came here especially to try the cultivated chicken. Normally, for sustainability reasons, she would not eat meat but Caterina says she would eat this.<br/>Her only quibble? Serving the chicken with pasta, which typically does not happen in Italy.<br/>Another diner from Singapore says he was surprised by how much it resembled real meat.<br/>\"It's legit\", he says. \"I wouldn't know where it came from. My only concern would be the cost.\"<br/>The chicken pasta dish I ordered was S$18.50 ($13.70; \u00a311), but that is vastly discounted relative to the current cost of producing the meat. <br/>Eat Just will not say exactly how much it spends on making its cultivated chicken, but at the moment the company's production capacity only yields 2kg (4.4lb) or 3kg per week in Singapore.<br/>When you compare that to the 4,000kg - 5,000kg of conventional chicken sold weekly - at Huber's alone - it gives you a sense of the scale of the task ahead. Put simply, they will need to increase production enormously to avoid making a loss on each piece of chicken.<br/>Eat Just says it has already achieved a 90% reduction in costs since 2018 and the company offered me a tour of its new multi-million dollar production facility in Singapore, which it hopes will open next year.<br/>The pair of shiny steel 1,320 gallon (6,000 litres) bioreactors certainly represent a sign of intent, but in reality they are a tiny fraction of the millions of tonnes of chicken that would need to be produced to match the price of slaughtered chicken.<br/>The industry is urging for patience, but many scientists have already seen enough.<br/>\"The narrative presented by these companies is very strong\", says Ricardo San Martin, co-director of the Alt: Meat Lab at the University of California, Berkeley.<br/>\"But that narrative must be contrasted with the science\", he says. \"Run the numbers, look at every scientific paper written by people who have no skin in the game, and you'll see the answer is clear.\"<br/>\"Can you do this, at scale, at a reasonable cost? No. Can you talk about saving the world with this? Again, no. These companies have to be honest - it's wishful thinking\", he says.<br/>Not only are there doubts about scaling up production, there is also uncertainty over the industry's green credentials, which have been questioned by scientists.<br/>In theory, reducing the world's reliance on land and livestock for meat production should reduce carbon emissions, but at the moment the advanced technology needed to create cultivated meat is so energy intensive that it cancels out any benefits. <br/>One study by the University of California, Davis even estimated that the process produces between 4 and 25 times as much carbon dioxide as regular beef. However, East Just has called the study \"flawed\".<br/>When asked by the BBC whether the whole project might end in failure, Josh Tetrick from Eat Just replied: \"For sure\".<br/>But he remains undeterred: \"Making meat in this way is both necessary and highly uncertain,\" he says.<br/>\"It's not straightforward. It's complicated. It's not guaranteed and it might not work out. But the other option for us is not to do anything. So we decided to take a bet and go for it.\"<br/>Plenty of investors have decided to make that same bet. As of this year, an estimated $2.8bn has been spent on developing cultivated meat.<br/>However, if cultivated meat is to become anything more than a niche alternative for the well-off in the developed world, then relying on investments from private businesses may not be enough.<br/>Governments, Mr Tetrick says, are going to need to put \"significant public money\" into cultivated meat for it to rival conventionally slaughtered meat. <br/>\"This is like the transition to renewable energy... It's a lifetime project - maybe a multiple lifetimes project,\" he says.<br/>At the moment though no country outside Singapore has authorised the sale of cultivated meat, let alone committed to serious investment.<br/>According to Ricardo San Martin from UC Berkeley, both private and public funding for cultivated meat companies will dry up if they do not \"look in the mirror\" soon and present realistic forecasts to investors.<br/>\"Unless there is a clear path to success at some point in the future, investors and governments will not want to spend money on something that is not scientifically proven\".<br/>Italy to ban lab-grown meat to protect heritage<br/>Lab-grown chicken safe to eat, say US regulators<br/>Singapore approves lab-grown 'chicken' meat<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

varying in size from under 20 employees to 200 - have already signed the pledge, which is divided into five \"pillars\".<br/>They include creating a maternity leave and return to work plan for employees and helping them \"maintain an emotional connection with the workplace so they do not feel anxious about being on maternity leave and their subsequent return to work\".<br/>Susannah believes current maternity leave practices often fall short of where they should be.<br/>She says: \"Although there are laws in place, the statistics and stories show that the measures currently in place to protect jobs and provide financial support are not working as well as they could as they're not reflective of the society we live in, what mothers want and the profound experience of motherhood.<br/>\"Our aim with the Maternity Pledge is to help keep mothers in the workplace if they want to be and through that we hope to see more women in leadership roles.\"<br/>Pregnant employees of firms that sign up are also given a \"matrescence pack\", which Susannah says covers \"the parts of motherhood which tend to be glossed over in pregnancy but can affect mental health\". <br/>It addresses issues such as breastfeeding problems and the affect of matrescence on relationships with partners.<br/>Companies already signed up to the pledge seem to be fully on board with its goals.<br/>Colchester-based PR company founder Megan Dorian says she is glad to be part of the project.<br/>\"When I launched Orange PR and Marketing when my first-born daughter was just over a year, I knew a priority for the business was to create an inclusive culture that not only supported but embraced parents in their journey,\" she says. <br/>\"There is still a stigma around women taking a career 'break' - it's certainly not a break - to have a baby and then return to work, and I am a big advocate for breaking this down.\"<br/>Another supporter is London-based Jenny Jones, chief operating officer of advisory, legal and accountancy firm Dragon Argent.<br/>\"Becoming a mother was the hardest transition I've ever had to make,\" she says. <br/>\"Going from being confident in your job and your life in general to being at home looking after a very small, fragile person 24/7 was tricky to say the least.  <br/>\"Supporting all our present and future parents through the often unspoken challenges of balancing parenthood and careers matters to us, which is why we signed The Maternity Pledge.\"<br/>Susannah says everyone benefits if companies support new mothers' return to work with as much flexibility and care for their wellbeing as possible.<br/>\"Maternity leave can work better for businesses and mothers if communication, support and empathy is improved,\" she says.<br/>\"Most women want to work - and with the cost of living, nearly all women need to work - so it's really important to keep women in a workplace where they feel valued and fulfilled.\"<br/>Tory MP: I'm dismayed by abuse for maternity leave<br/>'Maternity leave is hard and lonely'<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

If I have to give up being a blacksmith, then I will,\" the 39-year-old says.<br/>The craftsman is not alone. Many are facing similar financial dilemmas as they contemplate rising mortgage costs. <br/>The Bank of England has been steadily raising interest rates for the last year and a half, as it tries to tackle soaring prices. <br/>After figures last week showed inflation not coming down as quickly as expected, many now predict the central bank will continue to raise rates from their current level of 4.5% to as high as 5.5%.<br/>That in turn had an immediate impact on the mortgage market. Lenders began raising their rates. According to financial data firm Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 5.49% and the average five-year fixed is currently 5.17%.<br/>And within a week hundreds of mortgage deals were removed from the market as lenders reassessed their offers.<br/>\"Carnage\" is how Craig Fish from Lodestone brokers in London described the situation. <br/>\"I'm currently on hold to NatWest - 30 minutes and counting - to discuss a possible new mortgage as they have just announced they are withdrawing rates at 10.30pm tonight. Do the lenders think the future is this uncertain?\" he said earlier this week.<br/>Jo Wilder, 28, works for Cardiff Council and pays \u00a3700 a month for a studio apartment she has been renting for the past 18 months. She now wants to buy her own home - a process that is taking longer than she hopes, as she watches rates rise. <br/>Despite having a healthy 20% deposit and a mortgage in principle, she says there are \"not really any properties on the market\".<br/>Repayments on a three-year fixed-rate deal at 4.5% would be between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600 but she is worried about interest rates going up.<br/>\"It's not ideal. I'm just going to have to wait it out and hope rates come down. It really is very stressful,\" she says.<br/>Jo had hoped getting her own place would mean a drop in monthly outgoings but with rising food prices she no longer thinks that will be the case.<br/>\"It is disheartening,\" she adds. \"The way things are going I think it is actually going to be the same price, which is pretty daunting to be honest.\"<br/>In Bedfordshire, Anthony Jones and his wife have a 14-month-old daughter - they want to upsize and have been trying to sell since last August. <br/>The couple's five-year fixed deal has ended and they are now on a tracker mortgage, leaving them \u00a3200 worse off a month, at a little over \u00a31,200.<br/>\"It's a bit of a nightmare,\" says Anthony. \"We're looking at upsizing and all of a sudden are having to question the affordability of it.\"<br/>The 33-year-old says when they first put their house on the market there had been \"a lot of interest initially, then all of a sudden we had people saying 'our mortgage offer has been pulled' and 'we can't afford it anymore'.\"<br/>The couple have reduced the asking price from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a3275,000, but say they cannot accept less because otherwise they will not have the deposit for their second home.<br/>\"Our daughter has grown so quickly, we need a garden and bigger bedrooms and more storage. The lack of space is even causing arguments between me and my partner,\" says Anthony.<br/>Read more here<br/>The upheaval for people going through the application process comes as Bank of England figures this week showed a decline in the number of mortgages being approved. <br/>The number of net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell to 48,700 in April from 51,500 in March.<br/>Mortgage broker London & Country is now seeing a trend for people fixing for one or two years, rather than the previous most popular five-year term, on the basis that interest rates will have fallen by the time they come to look for their next deal.<br/>Spokesman David Hollingworth says people who are refinancing should start searching for a new product six months before the end of their current deal.<br/>Some may want to consider taking out new mortgages over a longer term - something a lot of first-time buyers do to \"give themselves breathing space\", he says.<br/>If it is a struggle to meet payments on an existing mortgage there is also the option of extending the term, but Mr Hollingworth says this is \"not a move to be taken lightly because it will significantly increase the overall interest bill, by tens of thousands of pounds\".<br/>Are you struggling to get a mortgage or one that's affordable?

A huge margin of users voted for r/pics to \"only allow images of John Oliver looking sexy\", with 37,331 votes for and 2,239 votes against. Other subreddits saw similar results.<br/>And it isn't just John Oliver that Reddit has to contend with.<br/>Other subreddits are similarly remaining active while changing their communities to fit within Reddit's rules, with r/iPhone now dedicated to \"dashing images\" of Apple chief executive Tim Cook, and moderators of r/scams approving content deliberately slowly, taking up to 14 days to review a post rather than a few minutes.<br/>Reddit communities go dark in protest at changes<br/>Twitch scraps ad changes after streamers leave<br/>Social media platform Reddit files to go public<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Last year, it resisted calls to cut ties with its controversial star Joe Rogan, who reportedly received $200m in 2020 for giving the streamer exclusive listening rights.<br/>But Mr Rogan's show offers several multi-hour episodes each week, which reportedly command an average audience of 11 million people. <br/>Meghan by contrast delivered just 12 episodes of her Archetypes podcast last year.<br/>The joint statement announcing the split said the Sussexes and Spotify were \"proud\" of the material they made together. <br/>And a string of accolades showed why.<br/>Archetypes' debut last year hit the top of Spotify's charts in six markets, including the US and UK. The show, in which Meghan interviewed fellow celebrities such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling, also won a People's Choice Award.<br/>But crisis communications guru Mark Borkowski says the show may not have been compelling enough when Spotify reviewed the numbers.  <br/>\"It's always about the content.... clearly there hasn't been a big enough audience for it,\" he says. \"If you can't deliver your fee, no one's going to pay it.\"<br/>Mr Borkowski says there is little doubt that the duke and duchess still have value as a media brand. But it may not be what it once was. <br/>Polling for Newsweek earlier this year suggested the couple's popularity in the US suffered following the publicity blitz surrounding their Netflix documentary series and the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare. \"The more Prince Harry and Meghan say, the less Americans like them,\" was Newsweek's headline.<br/>Mr Borkowski says the pair, who stepped back as working royals in 2020, will have to \"think hard\" about what they can offer in whatever they do next.<br/>\"It's a thread that's been pulled out of the brand,\" he says of the Spotify break-up. \"If they want to stop it unravelling they've really got to think hard. The biggest question is are they going to learn from this setback or are they going to ignore it as just a blip.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the Hollywood talent agency now representing the duchess told the Wall Street Journal this week: \"Meghan is continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform.\"<br/>Max Willens, senior analyst at Insider Intelligence, says Spotify is not the only tech giant that spent heavily in recent years to sign talent who failed to live up to the promise implied by the money they commanded. <br/>Those heady days ended last year, as economic sentiment soured and share prices sank. <br/>But shares in Spotify, which continues to add users and has seen its catalogue of podcasts jump to more than five million, are up nearly 90% this year, as investors welcome Mr Ek's promises to stay focused on \"efficiency\". <br/>In announcing the \"next phase\" for its podcasting business this month, the company signalled it would embrace lower-cost, third party creators, while pushing investment towards \"always on\" programming. <br/>\"The platforms that have gotten into [podcasting] had to take some time to figure out what constituted a good investment,\" Mr Willens says. He calls the decision by Spotify and the duke and duchess to part ways an \"understandable and natural part of that that process\". <br/>\"Those were big, big deals designed to generate buzz and grab headlines and they accomplished that.

It is a well-trodden and often profitable process.<br/>\"Once Clop names companies to its data leak site, the group will start its rounds of negotiations with affected organisations, demanding ransom payments in order to avoid their data being breached, said Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at ReliaQuest.<br/>Mr Morgan says the hackers will hope that the victims make contact and set a deadline of how long they have before their data is made public. <br/>Clop has been known to demand ransoms of hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars but police forces around the world discourage victims from paying as it fuels these criminal gangs.<br/>The MOVEit hack was first disclosed on 31 May when US company Progress Software said hackers had found a way to break into its MOVEit Transfer tool. <br/> MOVEit is software designed to move sensitive files securely and is popular around the world with most of its customers in the US.<br/>Progress Software said it alerted its customers as soon as the hack was discovered and quickly released a downloadable security update.<br/>But the criminals were already able to use their access to get into the databases of potentially hundreds of other companies.<br/>Payroll services provider Zellis, which is based in the UK, was a MOVEit user which was subsequently breached.

Now it is one of the world's most powerful technology companies, with an annual revenue of $200bn (\u00a3158.2bn). <br/>It is best known for making more than half of Apple's products - from iPhones to iMacs - but it also counts Microsoft, Sony, Dell and Amazon among its clients.<br/>For decades, it has thrived on a playbook perfected by multinational corporations - they design products in the US, manufacture them in China and then sell them to the world. That is how it grew from a small component-making business to the consumer electronics giant it is today.<br/>But as global supply chains adjust to souring ties between Washington and Beijing, Foxconn finds itself in an unenviable spot - caught between the world's two biggest economies, the very nations that have powered its growth until now. <br/>The US and China are at loggerheads over many things, from trade to the war in Ukraine. But one of the biggest potential flashpoints is Taiwan, where Foxconn is headquartered.<br/>Taiwan has been a thorny issue for a long time but Chinese leader Xi Jinping's repeated pledges of \"reunification\" have upset the uneasy status quo. Meanwhile, the US, under President Joe Biden, has been more vocal in its support for Taiwan in case of an attack.<br/>Some US voices have crossed China's red line, calling for independence, although the White House has reaffirmed its position that it maintains diplomatic relations with Beijing and not Taipei.<br/>There are hopes of a thaw with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visiting China this weekend. But there are also fears of a conflict - one US general has estimated it could happen as soon as the next few years.<br/>\"The United States and China are engaged in what we see as strategic competition,\" said Shihoko Goto, the deputy director for the Asia programme at the Wilson Center in Washington DC.<br/>\"Foxconn wants to do business with both, but there can only be one winner.\"<br/>But Mr Liu does not think it is that simple. For one, he said, Foxconn's business model, which relies on US designs and Chinese manufacturing, is far from over.<br/>\"We hire a lot of workers and most countries, including China, want to support their workers,\" Mr Liu said, adding that the Chinese government wants companies like Foxconn to keep going because of the huge number of jobs they create.<br/>Are rising tensions putting pressure on the model? \"So far? We haven't seen it,\" he told us.<br/>But the West and its allies have called for countries and companies to \"de-risk\" from China - a long-term shift to curb global reliance on China that is yet to play out.<br/>When asked if that was impacting business, Mr Liu responded cautiously. <br/>Some overseas clients had pushed to move production out of China, he said, but this was their decision to make, not Foxconn's.<br/>\"They get the push from their government about de-risking, and then they will let us know.\"<br/>Geopolitics aside, Covid-19 is another reason companies might consider \"de-risking\" from China.<br/>A mix of harsh Covid policies, a lack of space for quarantine and the infectiousness of the Omicron variant led to protests and riots at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou - the world's biggest iPhone plant - in late 2022. Hundreds of workers, who feared the spread of the virus, fled the campus on foot.<br/>Mr Liu said the scenes that played out for the world to see were caused by a lack of transportation due to Beijing's unyielding zero-Covid policy.<br/>But when pressed further, he admitted that he should have handled things differently.<br/>\"If the same situation occurs again, I would stop production altogether,\" he said, reiterating that he would have made that decision even at the risk of irking clients like Apple.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory<br/>The company's success certainly rests on its impressive client base, but Foxconn is just as indispensable to those clients.<br/>To understand how essential it is to Apple, for instance, you just need to look at how much of the iPhone is made by Foxconn - around 60%, by some estimates. The factories in China make some of the most essential parts of the device - camera modules, connectors, even the back of the phone casing.<br/>That expertise is also what Mr Liu is hoping will fuel Foxconn's next big bet: electric cars.<br/>\"Look at this - this is a big iPhone, so we're very familiar with this,\" he said, pointing to a panel that controlled the car he had taken us for a drive in.<br/>Built for families and priced for an aspiring global middle class, the shiny white SUV is one of several models manufactured by Foxconn. <br/>\"The reason why we think this is a great opportunity for us is that with the traditional gas engine, you have engines which are mostly mechanical. But with EVs, it's batteries and motors,\" he explains. <br/>That is a familiar language for a technology company like Foxconn, he added. <br/>Foxconn's hopes to capture about 5% of the global electric vehicle market in the next few years - an ambitious target given the firm has only made a handful of models so far. But it is a gamble that Mr Liu is confident will pay off.<br/>\"It doesn't make sense for you to make [EVs] in one place, so regionalised production for cars is very natural,\" he added. Foxconn car factories will be based in Ohio in the US, in Thailand, Indonesia and perhaps even in India, he said. <br/>For now, the company will keep focusing on what it does best - making electronic products for clients. But perhaps not too far in the future, Foxconn will do the same for clients with electric cars.<br/>Either way, with the foray into electric cars, Foxconn is diversifying not just production but also supply lines - both of which, Mr Liu believes, hold the key to the company's future.<br/>iPhone maker hikes pay ahead of new model launch<br/>iPhone maker sees revenue slump as demand weakens<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

CGI said  it was more than 90% accurate during a test run.<br/>It's being trialled in what's known as the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a 55-sq-mile (142-sq-km) protected area that includes important natural habitats as well as farmland and small towns. <br/>\"We'll give (the AI) the history,\" said CGI's chief sustainability officer Mattie Yeta. \"We'll give it all of the geographic information, as well as data sets from the sensors for it to learn and develop the predictive mechanisms to be able to inform where these incidents are occurring and indeed when they will take place.\"<br/>It's hoped the project could clean up the seaside resort town of Combe Martin, where the quality of bathing water has long been a concern. <br/>\"It's always been bumping along the bottom in terms of water quality,\" says Andy Bell from the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.<br/>Though the water at Combe Martin was last year rated by the Environment Agency as 'good', Mr Bell says that was mainly down to dry weather.  More typical years, he says, were 2018 and 2019 when it received a 'poor' rating, which meant a notice being posted advising people not to swim. <br/>\"There is very much a fear in the community of what would happen if the bathing water status was rescinded.\" Andy says <br/>\"It would impact on the cafes, the restaurants, the B&B's\u2026 people want to come to a clean place to enjoy themselves.\"<br/>The River Umber is the main culprit, according to Mr Bell. It reaches the sea through a corridor of lush green algae on the edge of the beach. The Umber is usually little more than a stream but it receives discharges both from a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff from farms. <br/>Cleaning up the Umber is seen as a first step towards improving the water quality on the beach and the key to that, according to the artificial intelligence project, is a huge amount of real-time information.  <br/>A couple of kilometres upstream from Combe Martin beach, a floating water sensor is being installed in the river. It's a square black box with solar panels on top and is moored by a cable to the bank. <br/>It automatically transmits a stream of data on six key indicators of water health including acidity (pH), ammonia, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and how clear the water is (turbidity).<br/>\"It's a really good overview of water quality,\" said Glyn Cotton, the chief executive of environment-focussed technology company Watr, which is supplying the \u00a32,000-a-go ($2,557) sensors to the project. <br/>\"If sewage was being discharged upstream we would see spikes in things like ammonia and pH and we can then cross-reference that with temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.\"<br/>About 50 connected sensors are being used across the catchment area, a mix of water, soil and rain gauges. Mapping company Ordnance Survey are providing the expertise to integrate that information with location specific data and satellite imagery. <br/>\"We can start training the model using data to get it understanding that when there was a pollution event - whether it was associated with a particular area?\" said Donna Lyndsay from Ordnance Survey. \"Was there for example a particular rainfall event that washed it all off?\"<br/>The hope is that the AI might, for example, advise a farmer to stop putting more fertiliser on his field, if the soil is dry and heavy rain forecast because of the likelihood of it being washed into the waterways. <br/>Preventing raw sewage being discharged by water treatment plants - a practice allowed when heavy rainfall overwhelms facilities -  is more complicated. The AI might see it coming after heavy rainfall but that doesn't mean the water company has the capacity to stopped it being released. <br/>The first phase of the AI project was a desk-based model using historic data, with CGI saying it predicted pollution events with 91.5% accuracy. Now the AI model is being unleashed 'in the wild' and the question is whether it can do the same.<br/>\"We're starting very small here (in North Devon) \u2026 but the idea is very much to scale up and roll this out to different parts of the UK.\" said CGI's Mattie Yeta. <br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing fast, and transforming many aspects of life.

No, this is a projection of human nature on machines\" he said. It would be a huge mistake to keep AI research \"under lock and key\", he added.<br/>People who worried that AI might pose a risk to humans did so because they couldn't imagine how it could be made safe, Prof LeCun argued.<br/>\"It's as if you asked in 1930 to someone how are you going to make a turbo-jet safe? Turbo-jets were not invented yet in 1930, same as human level AI has not been invented yet.\"<br/>\"Turbo jets were eventually made incredibly reliable and safe,\" and the same would happen with AI he said.<br/>Meta has a large AI research programme and producing intelligent systems as capable as humans is one of its goals. As well as research, the company uses AI to help identify harmful social media posts.<br/>Prof LeCun spoke at an event for invited press, about his own work in so-called Objective Driven AI which aims to produce safe systems that can remember, reason, plan and have common sense - features popular chatbots like ChatGPT lack.<br/>He said there was \"no question\" that AI would surpass human intelligence. But researchers were still missing essential concepts to reach that level, which would take years if not decades to arrive.<br/>When people raise concerns about the human-level or above machines that might exist in the future, they are referring to artificial general intelligence (AGI). These are systems, that like humans, can solve a wide range of problems.<br/>There was a fear that when AGI existed scientists \"get to turn on a super-intelligent system that is going to take over the world within minutes\", he said. \"That's you know just preposterously ridiculous.\"<br/>In response to a question from BBC news Prof LeCun said there would be progressive advances - perhaps you might get an AI as powerful as the brain of a rat. That wasn't going take over the world, and he argued \"it's still going to run on a data centre somewhere with an off switch\". He added: \"And if you realise it's not safe you just don't built it\".<br/>It has been argued that AI has the potential to replace many jobs, and some companies have paused recruiting for certain roles as a result. <br/>Prof LeCun told the BBC: \"This is not going to put a lot of people out of work permanently\". But work would change because we have \"no idea\" what the most prominent jobs will be 20 years from now, he said.<br/>Intelligent computers would create \"a new renaissance for humanity\" the way the internet or the printing-press did, he said.<br/>Prof LeCun was speaking Tuesday ahead of a vote on Europe's AI Act which is designed to regulate artificial intelligence.<br/>He said from his conversations with AI start-ups in Europe \"they don't like it at all, they think it's too broad, maybe too restrictive\". But he said he wasn't an expert on the legislation, <br/>Prof LeCun said he was not against regulation - but in his view each application would need its own rules, for example different rules would govern AI systems in cars and those scanning medical images.<br/>Warning using AI for loans and mortgages is big risk<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>AI 'godfather' feels 'lost' over life's work<br/>AI chatbots 'may soon be more intelligent than us'<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

But we shouldn't hold our breath,\" she said. <br/>\"We should do what we can here and now.\"<br/>Ms Vestager is spearheading EU efforts to create a voluntary code of conduct with the US government, which would see companies using or developing AI sign up to a set of standards that are not legally binding.<br/>The current draft of the AI Act seeks to categorise applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>High-risk AI systems include those that are used to evaluate credit scores or access to loans and housing. This is where the focus of strict controls on the tech will be.<br/>But as AI continues to develop quickly, Ms Vestager said there was a need to be pragmatic when it comes to fine-tuning rules around this technology. <br/>\"It's better to get, let's say 80% now than 100% never, so let's get started and then return when we learn and then correct with others,\" she said.<br/>Ms Vestager said there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence the next elections. <br/>She said the challenge for police and intelligence services would be to be \"fully on top\" of a criminal sector where there is a risk they get ahead in the race to utilise the tech. <br/>\"If your social feed can be scanned to get a thorough profile of you, the risk of being manipulated is just enormous,\" she said, \"and if we end up in a situation where we believe nothing, then we have undermined our society completely.\"<br/>Many tech leaders and researchers signed a letter in March calling for a pause in the development of AI systems more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4. <br/>But Ms Vestager said this was not realistic.<br/>\"No-one can enforce it. No-one can make sure that everyone is on board,\" she said, pointing out that a pause could be used by some as an opportunity to get ahead of competitors. <br/>\"What I think is important is that every developer knows that everyone has signed up for the same guardrails so that no-one takes excessive risks.\"<br/>The European Parliament's proposals for the AI Act seek to restrict the use of biometric identification systems and indiscriminate collection of user data from social media or CCTV footage for purposes such as facial recognition systems.<br/>However, Ms Vestager said: \"We want to put in strict guardrails so that it's not used in real-time, but only in specific circumstances where you're looking for a missing child or there's a terrorist fleeing.<br/>Before the AI Act can become finalised as the world's first rulebook on the use and development of AI systems, the EU's three branches of power: the Commission, Parliament and Council will all have to agree on its final version.<br/>It is not expected to come into effect before 2025. <br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Sam Altman: OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It lets Spotify, YouTube and BBC iPlayer suggest what you might want to play next, and helps Facebook and Twitter decide which social media posts to show users.<br/>AI lets Amazon analyse customers' buying habits to recommend future purchases - and the firm is also using the technology to crack down on fake reviews. <br/>Two powerful AI-driven applications or apps which have become very high profile in recent months are ChatGPT and Snapchat My AI. <br/>They are examples of what is called \"generative\" AI. <br/>This uses the patterns and structures it identifies in vast quantities of source data to generate new and original content which feels like it has been created by a human. <br/>The AI is coupled with a computer programme known as a chatbot, which \"talks\" to human users via text. <br/>The apps can answer questions, tell stories and write computer code. <br/>But both programmes sometimes generate incorrect answers for users, and can reproduce the bias contained in their source material, such as sexism or racism.<br/>With few rules currently in place governing how AI is used, experts have warned that its rapid growth could be dangerous. Some have even said AI research should be halted. <br/>In May, Geoffrey Hinton, widely considered to be one of the godfathers of artificial intelligence, quit his job at Google, warning that AI chatbots could soon be more intelligent than humans.<br/>Later that month, the US-based Center for AI Safety published a statement supported by dozens of leading tech specialists. <br/>They argue AI could be used to generate misinformation that could destabilise society. In the worst-case scenario, they say machines might become so intelligent that they take over, leading to the extinction of humanity.<br/>However, the EU's tech chief Margrethe Vestager told the BBC that AI's potential to amplify bias or discrimination was a more pressing concern. <br/>In particular she is concerned about the role AI could play in making decisions that affect people's livelihoods such as loan applications, adding there was \"definitely a risk\" that AI could be used to influence elections.<br/>Others, including tech pioneer Martha Lane Fox, say we shouldn't get what she calls \"too hysterical\" about AI, urging a more sensible conversation about its capabilities.<br/>Governments around the world are wrestling with how to regulate AI. <br/>Members of the European Parliament have just voted in favour of the EU's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act, which will put in place a strict legal framework for AI, which companies would need to follow. <br/>Margrethe Vestager says \"guardrails\" are needed to counter the biggest risks posed by AI. <br/>The legislation - which is expected to come into effect in 2025 - categorises applications of AI into levels of risk to consumers, with AI-enabled video games or spam filters falling into the lowest risk category.<br/>Higher-risk systems like those used to evaluate credit scores or decide access to housing would face the strictest controls. <br/>These rules will not apply in the UK, where the government set out its vision for the future of AI in March. <br/>It ruled out setting up a dedicated AI regulator, and said instead that existing bodies would be responsible for its oversight.<br/>But Ms Vestager says that AI regulation needs to be a \"global affair\", and wants to build a consensus among \"like-minded\" countries. <br/>US lawmakers have also expressed concern about whether the existing voluntary codes are up to the job.  <br/>Meanwhile, China intends to make companies notify users whenever an AI algorithm is being used.<br/>AI has the potential to revolutionise the world of work, but this raises questions about which roles it might displace. <br/>A recent report by investment bank Goldman Sachs suggested that AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs across the globe, as certain tasks and job functions become automated. That equates to a quarter of all the work humans currently do in the US and Europe. <br/>The report highlighted a number of industries and roles that could be affected, including administrative jobs, legal work, architecture, and management.<br/>But it also identified huge potential benefits for many sectors, and predicted that AI could lead to a 7% increase in global GDP. <br/>Some areas of medicine and science are already taking advantage of AI, with doctors using the technology to help spot breast cancers, and scientists using it to develop new antibiotics. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Further damage came from the meltdown of several high-profile firms, including FTX, run by the so-called \"Crypto King\" Sam Bankman-Fried, whom prosecutors have accused of conducting \"one of the biggest financial frauds\" in US history.<br/>Jolted by the turmoil, US regulators stepped up their policing of the sector, which authorities say has been on notice since at least 2017 that their activity runs afoul of US financial rules intended to protect investors.<br/>The campaign has yielded a steady drumbeat of charges against crypto firms and executives, alleging violations ranging from failing to register properly with authorities and provide adequate disclosure of their activity to, in some cases, more damaging claims such as mishandling of consumer funds and fraud.<br/>Bitcoin, which represents the biggest chunk of value in a sector in which thousands of currencies have circulated, is viewed by officials as a commodity, like gold. That means it has been largely unaffected by the current regulatory debate, which hinges on the legal question of what constitutes a \"security\" - an investment like a stock or bond that is overseen by the SEC.<br/>The efforts have instead ensnared firms issuing tokens or coins to raise money - and increasingly the exchanges on which such digital assets are bought and sold, which often hold customer funds, execute trades and engage in other activity that is separated in traditional finance. <br/>The crackdown culminated this month in legal actions against two of the biggest platforms: Coinbase and Binance.<br/>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, defended the moves this month, comparing the state of affairs in the industry to the 1920s, before the US put in place many of the rules in question: \"Hucksters. Fraudsters. Scam artists. Ponzi schemes. The public left in line at the bankruptcy court.\"<br/>Will Paige, research analyst for Insider Intelligence, says sentiment has soured significantly since 2021, when the industry was worth more than $3 trillion (\u00a32.4tn) by some estimates and seemed poised for wider acceptance.<br/>\"It's very much back on the fringe of finance,\" he says. \"Trust in the system is battered and it's definitely gotten worse.\"<br/>In the wake of the lawsuits, customers yanked billions of dollars of funds. US banks limited their work with Binance, forcing it to stop accepting US dollars and Robinhood, the trading app, said it would stop listing certain assets named in the lawsuits, citing the \"cloud of uncertainty\" surrounding the tokens.<br/>Critics accuse the SEC under Mr Gensler of hostile \"regulation by enforcement\" aimed at boosting his own political profile. <br/>They say that despite repeated efforts by the industry to propose new rules, the agency has refused to acknowledge the distinctions between different types of crypto firms and the characteristics of the technology, like decentralised automated processing, that challenge existing frameworks.<br/>\"It's been a very frustrating experience,\" says Bart Stephens, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in hundreds of crypto firms, some of which he says have been struggling to find banks willing to do business with them. \"There is no doubt a regulatory attack is going on.\"<br/>Bill Hughes, senior counsel of Consensys, a Texas-based software company that uses crypto's blockchain technology, puts it even more bluntly: \"The SEC has essentially determined that on its watch crypto shouldn't exist in the United States anymore.\"<br/>Whether the SEC's moves could actually kill the industry - in which by at least one estimate one in every six Americans has invested - is another question.<br/>Crypto's wider market value remains roughly a third of what it was at its peak. Trading volumes have plunged and developer interest is falling. Trust remains low.  The failures in March of some of the few traditional banks willing to do business with it marked a further blow.<br/>Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University, thinks crypto is inherently susceptible to boom-and-boost cycles and manipulation by insiders, and thinks it should be banned. She says the SEC's actions could help re-confine crypto to the realm of tech enthusiasts, given the wider state of the industry.<br/>\"If we combine these enforcement actions with waning trust from the public, with possibly waning interest from venture capital, then maybe there isn't a future,\" she says. <br/>But Mr Stephens, who has weathered two \"crypto winters\" already, says he thinks the future remains bright - if at risk of ending up overseas, given America's current approach, which is seen as less friendly than other jurisdictions, including the UK and the EU.<br/>He points to Bitcoin's price, which is hovering around 2020 levels, but has gained significantly from the start of the year. Ether has also risen. <br/>Some indicators tracked by venture firm and crypto-investor Andreessen Horowitz, such as the number of addresses active on blockchain and the number of smart contracts being executed, are also climbing.<br/>\"We're not seeing founders stop forming new companies or protocols,\" says Mr Stephens, who says Blockchain Capital invested more money in the first three months of 2023 than in any quarter in the previous 10 years, as prices fell and rival firms backed away from the sector.<br/>Even if the sector thrives outside the US, losing the American market would severely limit its prospects, warns Gina Pieters, a crypto expert who teaches at the University of Chicago.<br/>\"It would be a mistake to think that the US\u2026 could kill the industry. It can absolutely, though, make the crypto industry smaller,\" she says.<br/>Many in crypto are hoping for a reprieve - from the courts, which could decide the SEC has overstepped its authority; from Congress, where draft legislation for the industry is under review; or from a change in the White House, which could prompt a policy reversal.<br/>However those questions get decided, the issues are finally coming to a head, says Angela Walch, a research associate at the University College of London Centre for Blockchain Technologies.<br/>\"We are at a real inflection point,\" she says. \"The showdown is here.\"<br/>Treat cryptocurrency as gambling, MPs say<br/>US sues Coinbase as crypto crackdown widens<br/>NatWest limits crypto transfers over scam fears<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Perhaps an attempt to brush out that very dubious period of Twitter's history,\" federal minister Rajeev Chandrashekar tweeted on Tuesday. <br/>\"No one went to jail nor was Twitter 'shutdown'. Dorsey's Twitter regime had a problem accepting the sovereignty of Indian law. It behaved as if the laws of India did not apply to it.\" <br/>Mr Dorsey's comments - made to the American news series Breaking Points - are the latest in an already troubled relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government and Twitter.<br/>It also comes at a time when the platform has been caught up in an intensifying debate on its role in supporting principles of free speech amid demands in several countries to control Twittter's influence. <br/>Mr Dorsey quit as the Twitter CEO in 2021 and the social media platform was purchased by billionaire Elon Musk in 2022. <br/>In the interview, which was uploaded on YouTube on Monday, Mr Dorsey said \"countries like India and Turkey made many requests to us to take down journalists' accounts that give tactile information and remove them from the platform\".<br/>He added that he was \"surprised at the level of engagement and requests\" by governments of the world to censor content on the platform during his time.<br/>\"India, for example, was a country that had many requests around the farmers' protests, around particular journalists that were critical of the government,\" he said.<br/>\"It manifested in ways such as: 'we will shut Twitter down in India' - which is a very large market for us; 'we will raid the homes of your employees,' which they did; 'we will shut down your offices if you don't follow suit.' And this is India, a democratic country,\" Mr Dorsey told the show's hosts Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti.<br/>At the height of the farmers' protests against a series of agriculture reform laws, the government had asked Twitter to remove tweets it believed that had used an incendiary hashtag, and accounts it alleged were used by Pakistan-backed Sikh separatist groups.<br/>The request came after the largely peaceful protest had been jolted by violence on 26 January 2021, which left one person dead and hundreds of policemen injured. <br/>Twitter had first blocked some 250 accounts, including those of a news magazine and activists and organisations associated with supporting the year-long protests on the outskirts of capital Delhi.<br/>But six hours later, Twitter restored the accounts, citing \"insufficient justification\" for continuing the suspension.<br/>The Indian government immediately ordered Twitter to block the accounts again and told the company's employees in India that legal action would be taken - which could be up to seven years in prison - if they did not comply. <br/>Twitter responded, saying it would not block accounts belonging to media companies, journalists, activists and politicians because that would \"violate their fundamental right to free expression under the Indian law\".<br/>Relations between Twitter and Mr Modi's government have been downhill ever since. <br/>Critics say that at the heart of this is a new internet law that puts social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook under the direct supervision of the government. The government says the rules are meant to tackle misinformation and hate speech, but experts worry it would lead to censorship.<br/>Mr Musk, who succeeded Mr Dorsey, said in April that \"rules in India for what can appear on social media are quite strict\".<br/>In Monday's interview, Mr Dorsey compared India's actions to those by governments in Turkey and Nigeria, which have briefly restricted the platform in the past.<br/>\"Turkey is very similar [to India], we had so many requests from Turkey. We fought Turkey in their courts and often won, but they threatened to shut us down constantly,\" he said. <br/>\"Nigeria is another example... The situation was such that we could not even put our employees on the ground in the country out of fear of what the government might do to them.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\".<br/>Home Office drops 'racist' visa decision algorithm<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

And that is why this week's European Parliament debate on how the technology is regulated is so important. But how could AI be made safe?

These technologies don't sit within the boundaries of one country <br/>But there remains no plan for a global, United-Nations-style AI regulator - although, some have suggested it - and different territories have different ideas:<br/>\"If people trust it, then they'll use it,\" International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation EU government and regulatory affairs head Jean-Marc Leclerc says.<br/>There are enormous opportunities for AI to improve people's lives in incredible ways. It is already:<br/>But what about screening job applicants or predicting how likely someone is to commit crime?<br/>The European Parliament wants the public informed about the risks attached to each AI product. <br/>Companies that break its rules could be fined the greater of \u20ac30m or 6% of global annual turnover. <br/>But can developers predict or control how their product might be used?<br/>So far, AI has been largely self-policed.<br/>The big companies say they are on board with government regulation - \"critical\" to mitigate the potential risks, according to Sam Altman, boss of ChatGPT creator OpenAI. <br/>But will they put profits before people if they become too involved in writing the rules?<br/>You can bet they want to be as close as possible to the lawmakers tasked with setting out the regulations.<br/>And Lastminute.com founder Baroness Lane-Fox says it is important to listen not just to corporations. <br/>\"We must involve civil society, academia, people who are affected by these different models and transformations,\" she says.<br/>Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars in ChatGPT, wants it to \"take the drudgery out of work\". <br/>It can generate human-like prose and text responses but, Mr Altman points out, is \"a tool, not a creature\".<br/>Chatbots are supposed to make workers more productive.<br/>And in some industries, AI has the capacity to create jobs and be a formidable assistant.<br/>But others have already lost them - last month, BT announced AI would replace 10,000 jobs.  <br/>ChatGPT came into public use just over six months ago.<br/>Now, it can write essays, plan people's holidays and pass professional exams. <br/>The capability of these large-scale language models is growing at a phenomenal rate.<br/>And two of the three AI \"godfathers\" - Geoffrey Hinton and Prof Yoshua Bengio - have been among those to warn the technology has huge potential for harm. <br/>The Artificial Intelligence Act will not come into force until at least 2025 -  \"way too late\", EU technology chief Margrethe Vestager says. <br/>She is drawing up an interim voluntary code for the sector, alongside the US, which could be ready within weeks.<br/>What is AI and is it dangerous?<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Minister urges caution on AI 'Terminator' warnings<br/>Powerful AI ban possible, government adviser warns<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

That can include the author's relationship with other online accounts, their sign-in activity, review history, and any unusual behaviour.<br/>\"We use machine learning to look for suspicious accounts, to track the relationships between a purchasing account that's leaving a review and someone selling that product,\" Dharmesh Mehta, the head of Amazon's customer trust team, told the BBC.<br/>\"Through a combination of both important vetting and really advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence - that's looking at different signals or behaviours - we can stop those fake reviews before a customer ever encounters it,\" he said.<br/>Harry Kind from Which? said in the UK some estimates suggest around one in seven online consumer reviews are fake. <br/>\"Amazon has been trying all sorts of technology to crack down on fake reviews and by all accounts that's having some success.<br/>\"But as far as we're concerned, it's still nowhere near enough to solve this huge problem,\" he said.<br/>Fake reviews made consumers more than twice as likely to choose poor-quality products, the consumer group said.<br/>As a result of the new methods it had developed, Amazon said it had blocked over 200 million suspected fake reviews last year and would \"continue to build sophisticated tools that protect customers\".<br/>But the retail platform is calling for more cooperation between the private sector, consumer groups and governments to make the strategy more effective.<br/>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill that is currently going through the UK parliament is expected to strengthen the legal powers available to the regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in this area.<br/>Which? welcomed Amazon's call for a more collaborative approach, but called for the UK legislation to go further than currently envisaged \"by explicitly making the buying, selling and hosting of fake reviews subject to criminal enforcement.\"<br/>It said fake review \"factories\" on Facebook that trade reviews for Amazon and other sites were still easy to find. <br/>The CMA said it had already taken significant action against fake and misleading reviews and those who trade them.<br/>A spokesperson for the CMA said: \"Our investigations relating to fake reviews - including the case into Amazon - are ongoing and further updates will come later this year.\"<br/>In the UK, Amazon recently took legal action against the operators of NiceRebate.com, a fake review broker aimed at British customers. <br/>Other websites run by the same operators were also shut down, with simultaneous legal action taken against them in the US.<br/>\"We are aggressively fighting review brokers,\" said Mr Mehta.<br/>Amazon had taken legal action against 94 such \"bad actors\" he said, including fraudsters in the US, China and Europe. <br/>Amazon to pay $25m over child privacy violations<br/>New rules ban subscription traps and fake reviews<br/>Amazon to cut another 9,000 jobs<br/>Amazon to axe 18,000 jobs as it cuts costs<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

These days pilots have a lot more assistance from tech in the cockpit. <br/>Project Dragonfly, conducted on an Airbus A350-1000, extended the plane's autonomy even further.<br/>The project focused on three areas: improved automatic landing, taxi assistance and automated emergency diversion.<br/>Perhaps the last of those is the most dramatic. <br/>Malcolm Ridley, Chief Test Pilot of Airbus's commercial aircraft, reassured us that the risk of being involved in an air accident is \"vanishingly small\".<br/>However, aircraft and crew need to be ready for any scenario, so Project Dragonfly tested an automatic emergency descent system.<br/>The idea is this technology will take over if the pilots need to focus on heavy decision-making or if they were to become incapacitated. <br/>Under its own control, the plane can descend and land, while recognising other aircraft, weather and terrain.<br/>The system also allows the plane to speak to air traffic control over the radio with a synthetic voice created through the use of artificial intelligence. <br/>It is a lot for the plane's systems to take on. <br/>One of the challenges was teaching the system to understand all of the information and create a solution, says Miguel Mendes Dias, Automated Emergency Operations Designer. <br/>\"The aircraft needs to, on its own, recover all the information. So it needs to listen for the airport messages from air traffic control. <br/>\"Then it needs to choose the most suitable airport for diversion,\" he said. <br/>Project Dragonfly performed two successful emergency descents.<br/>During the test flights, French air traffic controllers fully understood the situation and the aircraft landed safely. <br/>\"It was really an amazing feat,\" says Mr Mendes.<br/>Thankfully, almost all landings are much less dramatic, and Project Dragonfly looked at the more usual kind as well. <br/>Most big airports have technology which guides the aircraft on to the runway, called Precision Approach. <br/>But not every airport in the world has that tech, so Airbus has been looking at a different way to land. <br/>Project Dragonfly explored using different sensors to help an aircraft make an automated landing.<br/>It included using a combination of normal cameras, infrared and radar technology.<br/>The team also gathered data from around the world, so all sorts of weather conditions could be modelled.<br/>As well as giving the plane more information, the extra sensors give the pilot extra clarity, when monitoring the landing.<br/>For example, infrared cameras are useful in cloudy conditions, as the closer you get to objects the more of its heat an infrared sensor can pick up.<br/>The tech \"will make the pilot comfortable in the fact that he's really aligned and on the good path to go to the runway,\" says Nuria Torres Mataboch, a computer vision engineer on the Dragonfly project.<br/>Project Dragonfly also looked at taxiing. Although this might seem like a basic task, it can be the most challenging part of the job, especially at the world's busiest airports.<br/>In this case, the pilot was in control of the aircraft.<br/>The technology provided the crew with audio alerts. So when the aircraft came across obstacles it issued an alert. It also advised pilots on speed and showed them the way to the runaway. <br/>\"We wanted something that would assist and reduce the pilots' workloads during the taxi phase,\" said Mr Ridley.<br/>What do pilots make of such developments? Some do not want the technology pushed too far. <br/>\"I don't know if any pilot is particularly comfortable with the computer being the sole arbiter of whether or not a flight successfully lands,\" said Tony Lucas, president of the Australian and International Pilots Association.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, he is not convinced that self-flying planes will be able to deal with complex scenarios that come up.<br/>\"Automation can't replace the decision making of two well-trained and rested pilots on the flight deck,\" he said from his base at Sydney airport. <br/>Mr Lucas used the example of the Boeing 737 Max, where an automated system led to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019. <br/>Airbus is quick to point out that further automation will only be introduced when safe and that the objective is not to remove pilots from the cockpit.<br/>But could passenger planes be pilot-free one day?<br/>\"Fully automated aircraft would only ever occur if that was clearly and certainly the safe way to go to protect our passengers and crew,\" says Mr Ridley.<br/>You can watch more on this story on BBC Click.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

What might take a human copywriter between 60 and 90 minutes to write, the AI could do in 10 minutes or less.<br/>Around four months after the AI was introduced, Mr Meadowcroft's four-strong team was laid off.<br/>Mr Meadowcroft can't be certain, but he's pretty sure the AI replaced them.<br/>\"I did laugh-off the idea of AI replacing writers, or affecting my job, until it did,\" he said.<br/>The latest wave of AI hit late last year when OpenAI launched ChatGPT.<br/>Backed by Microsoft, ChatGPT can give human-like responses to questions and can, in minutes, generate essays, speeches, even recipes.<br/>Other tech giants are scrambling to launch their own systems - Google launched Bard in March.<br/>While not perfect, such systems are trained on the ocean of data available on the internet - an amount of information impossible for even a team of humans to digest.<br/>So that's left many wondering which jobs might be at risk.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Earlier this year, a report from Goldman Sachs said that AI could potentially replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs.<br/>Any job losses would not fall equally across the economy. According to the report, 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated, but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance.<br/>The report also points out that the introduction of AI could boost productivity and growth and might create new jobs.<br/>There is some evidence of that already. <br/>This month IKEA said that, since 2021, it has retrained 8,500 staff who worked in its call centres as design advisers.<br/>The furniture giant says that 47% of customer calls are now handled by an AI called Billie. <br/>While IKEA does not see any job losses resulting from its use of AI, such developments are making many people worried.<br/>A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which polled 12,000 workers from around the world, found that a third were worried that they would be replaced at work by AI, with frontline staff more concerned than managers. <br/>Jessica Apotheker from BCG says that's partly due to fear of the unknown. <br/>\"When you look at leaders and managers, we have more than 80% of them that use AI at least on a weekly basis. When you look at frontline staff, that number drops to 20% so with the lack of familiarity with the tech comes much more anxiety and concern on the outcomes for them.\"<br/>But perhaps there is good reason to be anxious.<br/>For three months last year, Alejandro Graue had been doing voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel.<br/>It seemed to be a promising line of work, a whole YouTube channel in English had to be re-voiced in Spanish. <br/>Mr Graue went on holiday late last year confident that there would be work when he returned.<br/>\"I was expecting to have that money to live with - I have two daughters, so I need the money,\" he says.<br/>But to his surprise, before he returned to work, the YouTube channel uploaded a new video in Spanish - one he had not worked on.<br/>\"When I clicked on it, what I heard was not my voice, but an AI generated voice - a very badly synced voiceover. It was terrible. And I was like, What is this? Is this like going to be my new partner in crime like the channel? Or is this going to replace me?\" he says.<br/>A phone call to the studio he worked for confirmed the worst. The client wanted to experiment with AI because it was cheaper and faster.<br/>That experiment turned out to be a failure. Viewers complained about the quality of the voiceover and eventually the channel took down the videos that featured the AI-generated voice.<br/>But Mr Graue did not find that very comforting. He thinks the technology will only improve and wonders where that will leave voiceover artists like him.<br/>\"If this starts to happen in every job that I have, what should I do? Should I buy a farm? I don't know.  What other job could I look for that is not going to be replaced as well in the future? It's very complicated,\" he says.<br/>If AI is not coming for your job then it is likely you might have to start working with one in some way.<br/>After a few months of freelance work, former copywriter Dean Meadowcroft took a new direction.<br/>He now works for an employee assistance provider, which gives wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. Working with AI is now part of his job.<br/>\"I think that is where the future is for AI, giving quick access to human-led content, as opposed to completely eliminating that human aspect,\" he says.<br/>You can see the full interviews with Dean Meadowcroft and Alejandro Graue on Talking Business with Aaron Heslehurst on BBC News.<br/>Viewers in the UK can watch on BBC iPlayer from 11:30 on Saturday.

I asked him if it's good to be tailoring again and he gives me a big smile.<br/>Mr Zaitoun's work is a small part of Amsterdam's effort to become a circular economy.<br/>A traditional industrial economy uses raw materials to make products which are discarded when they are no longer wanted, sometimes before the end of their useful lives. <br/>The circular economy aims to break the link between economic activity and using up the earth's resources. This may involve reusing, repairing, and sharing materials and products. <br/>\"Circularity is the hottest topic in the fashion industry right now,\" says Thami Schweichler, chief executive at URC, an organisation he set up through his social enterprise Makers Unite, a creative textile platform.<br/>\"Every brand is looking at how they can be sustainable. Repairs will be part of the future of circularity for brands.\" <br/>There needs to be a systematic solution if change is to happen, he says. \"It's not going to happen through the consumer.\" <br/>Currently working with five brands including Patagonia, Scotch & Soda and Decathlon, companies send garments needing to be repaired to URC, which aims to fix goods within a week. <br/>Turning around over 400 repairs a week, or roughly 20,000 a year, Mr Schweichler says the target is to reach 200,000 repairs per year by 2026.<br/>Swelled by the rise of fast fashion, the clothing industry is known to be one of the most wasteful sectors, with three-quarters of our clothing ending up burned or buried in landfill, according to the World Economic Forum.<br/>According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, clothing production doubled from 2000 to 2015 while there was a 40% drop in the amount of time clothing was worn. <br/>While sustainability is on the agenda across many countries, in the Netherlands the government has set out bold plans to make the economy circular as quickly as possible.<br/>In 2020 the Amsterdam declared itself the first city in the world to commit to building a circular economy, focusing on food and organic waste streams, consumer goods, and the built environment.<br/>In seven years' time Amsterdam plans to have halved its use of new raw materials. By 2050, the ambition is to be fully circular - relying only on used and recycled materials.<br/>That will be a big challenge for the construction industry, which is responsible for more than 30% of the extraction of natural resources and 25% of solid waste generated in the world. <br/>One Dutch start-up, Madaster, is hoping to make a small dent in those statistics.<br/>It has created an online registry capturing the materials used in Amsterdam's buildings, as well as information about how they can be reused at the end of their life. <br/>\"The built environment uses a lot of materials and energy to create products,\" says director Pablo van den Bosch. \"Instead of waste and make, if we can instead reuse, it's good for carbon emissions and good for decreasing waste.\"<br/>He says Madaster worked together with the Amsterdam authorities to create a digital overview of the buildings across the city. \"If the city wants to redevelop an area they have insights into what materials they can save and perhaps use the materials already there instead of tearing it down.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>He points to the Olympic office in Amsterdam Zuid, which was completely refurbished rather than knocked down. \"Natural stone was removed from the fa\u00e7ade and used for flooring in the same building.\"<br/>Despite innovations like this, there is a long way to go. <br/>The Circular Economy Progress Report 2022 by PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency found that while \"policy efforts thus far have laid a foundation and developed a structure for a circular economy in the Netherlands\u2026 the Dutch economy still functions mainly in a linear fashion\".<br/>\"I'm afraid that the country and the city aren't meeting targets,\" says Willem van Winden, professor of urban economic innovation at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.<br/>\"The problem is that circular model and practices right now are costlier than linear ones. Unless the government implements stricter measures I'm afraid it will not happen. You need massive investment to make circular economy happen. A lot of businesses won't make the transition unless legislation forces them to.\" <br/>Nevertheless, Amsterdam is setting up initiatives to encourage start-ups to make a bigger splash in the circular economy sector.<br/>One initiative launched together with AMS Institute and venture capital accelerator Rockstart is Amsterdam Circular, a two-month programme designed to help 20 early-stage firms find funding. <br/>\"There was a clear need for the city to support early-stage start-ups and scale up financing,\" says Guy Vincent, programme lead at Amsterdam Circular. \"The programme is designed to support start-ups developing circular solutions in areas such as food, energy, mobilisation, construction and climate resilience.\" <br/>He says start-ups in the circular economy space face more challenges than other new firms.<br/>\"They are typically higher risk with lower profits as they can be testing new business models that are more complex and often not proven. Traditional VCs can be hesitant to invest in them. We want to try and find ideal financing models for circular companies. Co-financing is needed, i.e. private sector and a blend of public funds.\"<br/>Dutch electronics manufacturer Fairphone is one company that has managed to establish itself in the circular economy space.<br/>It encourages its customers to keep their phones as long as possible and makes the phones relatively easy to fix.<br/>\"Keeping the phone in longer use is the highest impact you can make in this product category,\" says Eva Gouwens, chief executive of Fairphone.<br/>She points out that 75% of carbon emissions happen at production. <br/>\"The average lifetime of a device is two to three years. If we can extend to at least every five years, then you only need half the materials.\" <br/>Fairphone also offers a recycling programme, encouraging customers to hand in their old phone in return for at least \u20ac50. \"We can use modules or at least components for repairing other devices. Many phones are sat in drawers or go to landfill,\" she says.<br/>Prof van Winden is encouraged by the companies developing circular models, but has this observation about the circular economy: \"For now it's mainly the upmarket segments and they're often expensive products for richer people.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

He also works at Chia Network, which provides a blockchain technology. <br/>Chia Network could easily reuse storage devices that large data centres have decided they no longer need. In 2021, the company approached IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) firms, who dispose of old technology for businesses that no longer need it. The answer came back: \"Sorry, we have to shred old drives.\"<br/>\"What do you mean, you destroy them?\" says Mr Hands, relating the story. \"Just erase the data, and then sell them! They said the customers wouldn't let them do that. One ITAD provider said they were shredding five million drives for a single customer.\" <br/>Storage devices are typically sold with a five-year warranty, and large data centres retire them when the warranty expires. Drives that store less sensitive data are spared, but the CDI estimates that 90% of hard drives are destroyed when they are removed. <br/>The reason? \"The cloud service providers we spoke to said security, but what they actually meant was risk management,\" says Mr Hands. \"They have a zero-risk policy. It can't be one in a million drives, one in 10 million drives, one in 100 million drives that leaks. It has to be zero.\"<br/>The irony is that shredding devices is relatively risky today. The latest drives have 500,000 tracks of data per square inch. A sophisticated data recovery person could take a piece as small as 3mm and read the data off it, Mr Hands says.<br/>Last year, the IEEE Standards Association approved its Standard for Sanitizing Storage. It describes three methods for removing data from devices, a process known as sanitisation. <br/>The least secure method is \"clear\". All the data is deleted, but it could be recovered using specialist tools. It's good enough if you want to reuse the drive within your company. <br/>The most extreme method is to destroy the drives through melting or incineration. Data can never be recovered, and nor can the drive or its materials.<br/>Between the two sits a secure option for re-use: purging. When the drive is purged, data recovery is unfeasible using state-of-the-art tools and techniques. <br/>There are several ways a drive can be purged. Hard drives can be overwritten with new patterns of data, for example, which can then be checked to make sure the original data has gone. With today's storage capacities, it can take a day or two.<br/>By comparison a cryptographic erase takes just a couple of seconds. Many modern drives have built-in encryption, so that the data on them can only be read if you have the encryption key. If that key is deleted, all the data is scrambled. It's still there, but it's impossible to read. The drive is safe to resell.<br/>Seagate is a leading provider of data storage solutions, and a founding member of the CDI. \"If we can universally, among all of our customers, trust that that we have secure erase, then drives can be returned to use,\" says Amy Zuckerman, sustainability and transformation director at Seagate. \"That is happening, but on a very small scale.\"<br/>In its 2022 financial year, Seagate refurbished and resold 1.16 million hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs), avoiding more than 540 tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste). That includes drives that were returned under their warranty and drives that were bought back from customers.<br/>A pilot take-back programme in Taiwan recovered three tonnes of e-waste. The challenge now, Ms Zuckerman says, is to scale the programme up. <br/>Refurbished drives are tested, recertified and sold with a five or seven-year warranty. \"We are seeing small data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations pick them up,\" she says. \"Our successes have been on a smaller scale, and I think that's probably true for others engaged in this work too.\"<br/>There are no projections for how many times each drive can be refurbished and reused. \"Right now, we are just looking at that double use,\" Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>There is huge potential for such schemes. A large proportion of the 375 million hard drives sold by all companies in 2018 are now ending their warranty.<br/>For drives that can't be reused, Seagate looks first at parts extraction and then materials recycling. In the Taiwan pilot programme, 57% of the material was recycled, made up of magnets and aluminium. Innovation is needed across the industry to help recover more of the 61 chemical elements used in the drives, Ms Zuckerman says.<br/>The principle of sanitising and reusing hardware also applies to other devices, including routers. \"Just because a company has a policy of replacing something over three years, it doesn't mean it's defunct for the entire world,\" says Tony Anscombe, the chief security evangelist at IT security company ESET. <br/>\"A large internet service provider (ISP) may well be decommissioning some enterprise grade routers that a smaller ISP would dream of having.\" <br/>More technology of business:<br/>It's important to have a decommissioning process that secures the devices, though. ESET bought some second-hand core routers, the type used in corporate networks. Only five out of 18 routers had been wiped properly. The rest contained information about the network, applications or customers that could be valuable to hackers. All had enough data to identify the original owners.<br/>One of the routers had been sent to an e-waste disposal company, who had apparently sold it on without removing the data. ESET contacted the original owner. \"They were very shocked,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"Companies should sanitise devices themselves as best as they can, even if they're using a sanitisation and e-waste company.\"<br/>Mr Anscombe recommends companies test the process of sanitising devices while they're still under support. If anything is unclear, help is available from the manufacturer then. He also suggests saving all documentation needed for the process in case the manufacturer removes it from their website. <br/>Before sanitisation, Mr Anscombe says companies should make and store a back-up of the device. If any data does leak, it's easier to understand then what has been lost. <br/>Finally, companies should make it easy for people to report security leaks. Mr Anscombe says it was hard to notify companies of what they had found on their old routers.<br/>How can companies be sure the data has gone from a device? \"Give it to a security researcher and ask them what they can find,\" says Mr Anscombe. \"A lot of cyber-security teams will have someone who understands how to take the lid off and see if the device was fully sanitised.\"<br/>By knowing how to clean the data from devices, companies can send them for reuse or recycling with confidence. \"The days of the 'take-make-waste' linear economy need to be over,\" says Seagate's Ms Zuckerman.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

People who would kill him.<br/>\"This is the only game I've ever seen that actually confuses my brain into thinking it's real,\" reads the top comment below the YouTube video of gameplay from Unrecord, an upcoming title by French indie game studio Drama.<br/>The video chalked up millions of views in just a few weeks and caused a sensation in the games industry. Some commentators on social media questioned if it really was a game and, if so, whether it was actually a little too real - too raw - an experience.<br/>Drama declined an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We are currently busy with investors and publishers.\"<br/>But graphics in many different games have been getting noticeably more sophisticated, arguably approaching what's known as \"photorealism\" - indistinguishable from photos or videos of the real world.<br/>The Unrecord demo looks so lifelike partly thanks to some clever techniques, says Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analytics.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points to the shaky camera, which imitates actual crime scene footage. The dull lighting, grittiness and urban bustle audible in the background all help, too.<br/>But could it make some people uncomfortable?<br/>\"That setting for it is quite reminiscent of some of the more horrendous footage you get out of real life,\" notes Mr Harding-Rolls. <br/>In a statement posted on Twitter, Drama said the game is not inspired by specific real-life events.<br/>Also, look closely at still images from the video and it's possible to see some objects and textures that don't look realistic at all. This might not matter - but it does undermine the idea that the game is photorealistic.<br/>Mr Harding-Rolls points out that, in general, advances in graphics matter for the games industry: \"Consumers definitely want that. They love looking at things and thinking, 'Wow, this looks amazing'.\"<br/>Rachel McDonnell, professor in creative technologies, Trinity College Dublin agrees that the Unrecord video is impressive, though she notes that certain character animations are a little clunky.<br/>They call to mind the movement of characters in other games falling over and dying in pre-programmed sequences.<br/>\"Animation hasn't caught up with the rendering at all in games yet,\" she says, adding that crowds are particularly tricky to make lifelike.<br/>\"You'll still see them doing very strange behaviour, running around in circles and getting stuck - that instantly breaks you from your presence in the game.\"<br/>Experiments she and her colleagues have conducted suggest that, for players' immersion in games, how an on-screen character looks is much less important than how they move.<br/>Marc Whitten, president of Create Solutions at game software firm Unity notes that today's most realistic content relies on highly-detailed 3D modelling of objects.<br/>Last year, Unity showed off a computer generated clip of a lion and its cub featuring two million individually rendered strands of fur.<br/>\"If you don't do that, it does not come across as photorealism,\" argues Mr Whitten. The firm has also developed highly lifelike models of humans, where digital puppetry controls their subtle facial expressions.<br/>There's still room for improvement, he adds. There are many other difficult-to-simulate materials, such as clothing, which are still a long way from looking photorealistic in games.<br/>One important emerging technology for game graphics is neural radiance fields, or NeRFs. California-based Luma AI specialises in this and says it already has customers using the tech to make games.<br/>A NeRF is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can represent objects or scenery captured in photographs or video footage in the real world. <br/>\"When you show it these images from different sides, the network learns how light is bouncing off of everything,\" explains Luma AI co-founder Amit Jain. \"It measures light and it learns from light.\"<br/>The way light reflects off a motorbike's leather seat versus a headlamp, for example, is completely different and simulating that in a game is very challenging. Nerfs could help to automate the process.<br/>Some of the best game graphics today use what's known as ray-tracing - accurate simulations of the way light bounces off surfaces or creates glowing effects around neon signs and so on. <br/>AI is making it possible to produce these effects in games despite only modest improvements in chip performance, says Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research, Nvidia.<br/>\"We have to be smarter in how we construct the world and how we render it,\" he explains.<br/>A new mode for Cyberpunk 2077, an action-adventure game, called Ray Tracing: Overdrive, demonstrates the difference this can make.<br/>Nvidia says its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology allows developers to create high resolution, high frame-rate graphics featuring ray-tracing with the help of AI.<br/>\"The model's trained to know what things in the real-world look like,\" explains Mr Catanzaro.<br/>Games are increasingly difficult to tell apart from real life at times, says Nick Penwarden, vice president of engineering, Epic Games.<br/>However he says it is still very hard to render certain materials convincingly - such as an iridescent layer of oil on a puddle of water.<br/>\"Those are aspects that we don't yet have the power to simulate in real time,\" he says.<br/>And doing that on games consoles or home PCs is what matters. For movies featuring computer generated imagery, it's possible to use huge computers and take many minutes or more to render individual frames.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The most popular games of the future might not need to be photorealistic. Consider Minecraft or Epic's own Fortnite - both enormously successful, both very far from photoreal. <br/>Improved lighting effects and material simulations help artists working on all kinds of games, though, argues Mr Penwarden. It can give stylised or cartoonish environments more depth and complexity, too.<br/>\"One of the great benefits about having the ability to do photoreal images is the tech can start to do a lot of the work for you,\" he says.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

But victims of her crimes should not get their hopes up about recouping their cash.<br/>They say restitution in the US has become largely symbolic, meaning Holmes' investors - and many less wealthy victims of fraud - are unlikely to get most of the money they are owed. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes<br/>\"There are very few people - the Bernie Madoffs of the world and everyone else - that can pay the full amount of criminal restitution,\" says Ryan O'Neill, a former federal prosecutor. \"It's sort of a fake number.\"<br/>Holmes will still be expected to try to pay these people and others she defrauded, she adds. Prosecutors have probably already begun to seize her assets, including money in the bank and properties. They will compare their own accounts of how much money she has to what she claims she possesses, which could lead to disputes, Ms O'Neill said. <br/>The Theranos founder's debts won't pause when she sets foot behind bars. <br/>A judge has recommended Holmes report to Federal Prison Camp in Bryan, Texas, where all inmates are obligated to work and make between 12 cents and $1.15 an hour. <br/>Half of the small sum she earns - usually around $25 every four months - will go to her victims, said Randy Zelin, a professor at Cornell Law School. <br/>Once her time in prison is finished, she will still not be able to purchase any large assets, including a home, without intervention from the federal government. The government can't, however, seize assets owned solely by her husband, hotel heir William Evans. <br/>Holmes has acknowledged her dismal financial fate, telling the New York Times this month she will \"have to work for the rest of my life\" just to pay millions of dollars in legal fees. <br/>But there are a number of reasons why her victims and many others are unlikely to get the money back. <br/>Criminal defendants don't have an incentive to \"make it rich\" again, said Ms O'Neill. \"They know where the money is going to go.\" <br/>Others may attempt to hide assets. University of Michigan Law School professor John Pottow says some try to put money in trusts to avoid asset seizures. \"The richer you get, the easier it is to construct legal devices that hide your wealth.\" <br/>Experts pointed to the case of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who has been ordered to pay nearly $1.5bn to families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for spreading lies about the massacre, which they said has led to harassment. <br/>Mr Jones - who has declared both personal and business bankruptcy - has been accused of funnelling money to friends and family in an attempt to hide his assets. <br/>Ms O'Neill said that although prosecutors will be tracking Mr Jones' moves, the Sandy Hook families - who are not as wealthy as the victims of Holmes - are unlikely to receive much money from the right-wing InfoWars host, whom she said will be paying most of his funds to his lawyers. <br/>In lower profile cases, the US government does not have the resources or the time to investigate every defendant's assets, sometimes putting the onus on victims to track their financial moves, Mr Zelin said. <br/>But the headline-making nature of Holmes' fraud - as well as her recent financial choices, including living in a $13,000 a month Silicon Valley estate - means former Theranos investors are more likely to keep watch over her and push prosecutors to get them their money back, experts said. <br/>\"They're not going to stop looking,\" Ms O'Neill said. \"She's not going to be able to put a dollar in her bank account\u2026 without the government seizing it.\"<br/>Inside the routine at Elizabeth Holmes' prison<br/>Elizabeth Holmes to begin jail sentence this month<br/>The prison experience Holmes is desperate to avoid<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Heat pumps work by compressing gently warmed refrigerants to raise the temperature of these fluids. That heat can then be passed on to homes or industrial machinery.<br/>Heat pumps require electricity to work but can produce around three or four kilowatt hours of heat for every kilowatt hour of power they consume.<br/>Heat pumps are increasingly popular with some home owners but domestic devices are relatively small and tend to have outputs of several kilowatts or so. MAN ES's biggest commercial heat pump is thousands of times more powerful - with a total heating capacity of 48 megawatts (MW). <br/>It can produce temperatures of up to 150C and heat thousands of homes, not just one. The company recently installed two of these machines in the port city of Esbjerg, in Denmark.<br/>In this installation, the heat pumps' CO2 refrigerant will absorb a small amount of heat from seawater. Compressors boost the temperature of the CO2 and the system can then transfer this heat, providing water of up to 90C to a district heating system serving 27,000 households.<br/>\"The demand for district heating is exploding,\" says Mr Decorvet. An urgency to move away from fossil fuels is leading to a rush - particularly in Europe - for bigger and beefier heat pump systems that can power entire towns. But who has the biggest, megawatts-wise?<br/>It might seem like a relatively straightforward question but it is actually quite tricky to answer definitively. Not least because heat pumps don't tend to work at maximum capacity all the time. In Esbjerg, MAN ES's heat pumps will run at about half their potential output, for instance.<br/>And trying to compare the world's largest heat pump systems is difficult because, often, they are made up of multiple smaller heat pumps chained together. Take the district heating system in Stockholm, Sweden, often referred to as the largest heat pump set-up in the world.<br/>This is probably true, it has a maximum capacity of 215MW - but that total is the sum of seven heat pumps, two 40MW and five 27MW devices, a spokesman for energy provider Stockholm Exergi explains.<br/>Elsewhere in Sweden, Gothenburg has a 160MW heat pump system that consists of four units. Two of them are actually bigger than those in Stockholm, with capacities of 50MW each.<br/>They have been in operation since 1986 and probably hold the title of the most powerful individual heat pumps currently in use, though they are clearly rivalled by newer devices such as those made by MAN ES. <br/>Last year, German chemicals firm BASF and MAN ES announced their intention to build a 120MW heat pump that would, reports suggested, be the world's largest. <br/>It would have provided heat for industrial uses at a site in Ludwigshafen. However, it was not to be. \"BASF has decided not to proceed with the project,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The firm is exploring other potential heat sources instead, which it hopes will be more economically attractive.<br/>Size isn't necessarily everything, notes Dave Pearson, group sustainable development director at Star Refrigeration. Efficiency matters and he argues that ammonia - his firm's choice of refrigerant - helps to make heat pumps particularly efficient. <br/>Veronika Wilk at the Austrian Institute of Technology and colleagues have studied the use of heat pumps for industrial applications, to provide heat in pharmaceutical, food or paper factories, for example. <br/>So long as they don't require very high temperatures beyond 200C, companies are increasingly turning to heat pumps, Dr Wilk argues, because it allows them to move away from natural gas, which has become extremely expensive following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.<br/>But industrial heat pumps tend to be merely several MW in capacity or so. You are more likely to spot truly giant heat pumps in a district heating system, such as those mentioned above, says Dr Wilk.<br/>\"The beauty of district heating is that you can decarbonise a lot of households at once,\" she adds.<br/>There are many other examples of heat pump-powered district heating systems springing up. In Vienna, a 55MW system using three heat pumps is due to go live this autumn.<br/>The machines will harvest heat, around 6C, from treated wastewater, explains Linda Kirchberger, division manager asset decarbonisation and new technologies at Wien Energie. <br/>The treated water used to go straight into a river. \"Now it does a detour and we take it through the heat pump system,\" she says.<br/>The system will lift temperatures from 6C to 90C and the heat will go on to supply 56,000 households. In 2027, Wien Energie plans to double the system's capacity with three more heat pumps, reaching 110MW in total.<br/>While still impressive, and weighing more than 200 tonnes each, these individual units have a capacity of less than 20MW. The manufacturer, Johnson Controls, confirmed to the BBC that its largest heat pumps have a maximum output of 28MW.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>A similar system, also using heat from wastewater, is planned in Hamburg, according to reports. It will have a capacity of 60MW, though this too will rely on multiple heat pumps linked together, a spokeswoman for Hamburg Wasser, the water company involved in the project, says.<br/>But keep an eye on the future. In the Finnish capital Helsinki, a plan is afoot to construct a gargantuan heat pump system with a total capacity of 500MW. <br/>This will likely be comprised of multiple units, as in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Esbjerg, but Helen, the energy company behind the scheme, has not yet revealed how it will all come together.<br/>MAN ES is one firm bidding for the contract. A spokesman declined to explain exactly what configuration of heat pumps would allow the company to provide 500MW of heat. Mr Decorvet says, simply, \"I hope we are going to win.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

These range from paralysis and blindness to depression and schizophrenia. <br/>The procedure would involve implanting a tiny hermetically sealed chip directly into a patient's brain. <br/>The chip is connected to 1,024 tiny electrodes, no thicker than a human hair and is powered by a battery that can be recharged wirelessly. It would create an interface with an external computer, allowing it to both send and receive signals.<br/>There are three elements to this: short term physical risks; long term medical concerns; and ethical safety. <br/>Any surgery involving the brain carries inherent danger, both of physical harm and rejection by the host. There has been extensive (and controversial) testing of the chips on animals. <br/>A complaint filed in February to the US Department of Agriculture alleged cruel treatment of macaque monkeys who are being used to test the technology. <br/>The fact that the FDA has approved the start of human testing, however, implies the company has overcome some of the challenges. <br/>Maybe the more serious concerns come around the long-term consequences of having a device like this operating within the human brain, a vastly complex organ we are only beginning to understand. <br/>Understandably there is no data as to what the potential harms may be. That will change with testing on humans and will be key to the development of similar products. <br/>The final element, ethical safety, is more subjective. Technology like this is riven with concerns about data protection, potential uses and the possibility of human enhancement. <br/>This means augmenting or enhancing the capabilities of the human brain beyond what we are currently capable of doing. For example, improving human cognition, sensory perception, or physical abilities. This always stirs strong emotions and raises ethical questions so there will be calls for close regulation of the sector.<br/>The firm was founded in California by Elon Musk and a team of seven scientists and engineers in 2016.  But of last year, of the eight cofounders, only two remained at the company.<br/>Elon Musk brings an entrepreneurial approach to tackling an issue which many see as fundamentally scientific. He also inevitably brings something else - publicity. He is one of the most recognisable and controversial people on the planet. <br/>When he speaks, generally people listen and react. His involvement in Neuralink is one of the reasons people are talking about it today. <br/>Yes, quite a few are, with some said to be further on in their research than Neuralink. Black Rock Neuro Tech are working on a similar product, also implanting chips into the human brain. <br/>There's lots of different work being done, however, not all of it so invasive. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, are thought to be working on wearable tech that would allow people to type with their minds. <br/>Last week news emerged of a paralysed man helped to walk again by Swiss scientists. In short, this is a rapidly expanding field with many players. <br/>Elon Musk's involvement guarantees that Neuralink will often win the race for publicity, but that will not ultimately decide which firms succeed. <br/>That will come down to which technology works best and who can prove to regulators and markets that it is safe. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The company said it was raising production of chips to meet \"surging demand\".<br/>Nvidia has come to dominate the market for chips used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems.<br/>Interest in that sector reached frenzied levels after ChatGPT went public last November, which sent a jolt well beyond the technology industry.<br/>From helping with speeches, to computer coding and cooking, ChatGPT has proved to be a wildly popular application of AI.<br/>But all that would not be possible without powerful computer hardware - in particular computer chips from California-based Nvidia.<br/>Originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games, Nvidia hardware underpins most AI applications today.<br/>\"It is the leading technology player enabling this new thing called artificial intelligence,\" says Alan Priestley, a semiconductor industry analyst at Gartner.<br/>\"What Nvidia is to AI is almost like what Intel was to PCs,\" adds Dan Hutcheson, an analyst at TechInsights.<br/>ChatGPT was trained using 10,000 of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) clustered together in a supercomputer belonging to Microsoft.<br/>\"It is one of many supercomputers - some known publicly, some not - that have been built with Nvidia GPUs for a variety of scientific as well as AI use cases,\" says Ian Buck, general manager and vice president of accelerated computing at Nvidia.<br/>Nvidia has about 95% of the GPU market for machine learning, noted a recent report from CB Insights. <br/>Its AI chips, which it also sells in systems designed for data centres, cost roughly $10,000 (\u00a38,000) each, though its latest and most powerful version sells for far more.<br/>So how did Nvidia become such a central player in the AI revolution? <br/>In short, a bold bet on its own technology plus some good timing.<br/>Jensen Huang, now the chief executive of Nvidia, was one of its founders back in 1993. Then, Nvidia was focused on making graphics better for gaming and other applications.<br/>In 1999 it developed GPUs to enhance image display for computers.<br/>GPUs excel at processing many small tasks simultaneously (for example handling millions of pixels on a screen) - a procedure known as parallel processing.<br/>In 2006, researchers at Stanford University discovered GPUs had another use - they could accelerate maths operations, in a way that regular processing chips could not.<br/>It was at that moment that Mr Huang took a decision crucial to the development of AI as we know it.<br/>He invested Nvidia's resources in creating a tool to make GPUs programmable, thereby opening up their parallel processing capabilities for uses beyond graphics.<br/>That tool was added to Nvida's computer chips. For computer games players it was a capability they didn't need, and probably weren't even aware of, but for researchers it was a new way of doing high performance computing on consumer hardware.<br/>It was that capability that helped sparked early breakthroughs in modern AI.<br/>In 2012 Alexnet was unveiled - an AI that could classify images. Alexnet was trained using just two of Nvidia's programmable GPUs.<br/>The training process took only a few days, rather than the months it could have taken on a much larger number of regular processing chips.<br/>The discovery - that GPUs could massively accelerate neural network processing - began to spread among computer scientists, who started buying them to run this new type of workload.<br/>\"AI found us,\" says Mr Buck. <br/>Nvidia pressed its advantage by investing in developing new kinds of GPUs more suited to AI, as well as more software to make it easy to use the technology.<br/>A decade, and billions of dollars later, ChatGPT emerged - an AI that can give eerily human responses to questions. <br/>AI start-up Metaphysic creates photorealistic videos of celebrities and others using AI techniques. Its Tom Cruise deep fakes created a stir in 2021.<br/>To both train and then run its models it uses hundreds of Nvidia GPUs, some purchased from Nvidia and others accessed through a cloud computing service. <br/>\"There are no alternatives to Nvidia for doing what we do,\" says Tom Graham, its co-founder and chief executive. \"It is so far ahead of the curve.\"<br/>Yet while Nvidia's dominance looks assured for now, the longer term is harder to predict. \"Nvidia is the one with the target on its back that everybody is trying to take down,\" notes Kevin Krewell, another industry analyst at TIRIAS Research.  <br/>Other big semiconductor companies provide some competition. AMD and Intel are both better known for making central processing units (CPUs), but they also make dedicated GPUs for AI applications (Intel only recently joined the fray).<br/>Google has its tensor processing units (TPUs), used not only for search results but also for certain machine-learning tasks, while Amazon has a custom-built chip for training AI models.<br/>Microsoft is also reportedly developing an AI chip, and Meta has its own AI chip project.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>In addition, for the first time in decades, there are also computer chip start-ups emerging, including Cerebras, SambaNova Systems and Habana (bought by Intel). They are intent on making better alternatives to GPUs for AI by starting from a clean slate. <br/>UK-based Graphcore makes general purpose AI chips it calls intelligence processing units (IPUs), which it says have more computational power and are cheaper than GPUs.<br/>Founded in 2016, Graphcore has received almost $700m (\u00a3560m) in funding.<br/>Its customers include four US Department of Energy national labs and it has been pressing the UK government to use its chips in a new supercomputer project. <br/>\"[Graphcore] has built a processor to do AI as it exists today and as it will evolve over time,\" says Nigel Toon, the company's co-founder and chief executive.<br/>He acknowledges going up against a giant like Nvidia is challenging. While Graphcore too has software to make its technology accessible, it is hard to orchestrate a switch when the world has built its AI products to run on Nvidia GPUs. <br/>Mr Toon hopes that over time, as AI moves away from cutting-edge experimentation to commercial deployment, cost-efficient computation will start to become more important.<br/>Back at Nvidia, Ian Buck is not overly concerned about the competition. <br/>\"Everyone has the need for AI now,\" he says. \"It is up to others to work out where they are going to make a contribution.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

And there is already the possibility that current restrictions on semiconductor exports to China could hamper Beijing's technological progress.<br/>But China could catch up, according to analysts, as AI solutions take years to be perfected. Chinese internet companies \"are arguably more advanced than US internet companies, depending on how you're measuring advancement,\" Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy research at Trivium China tells the BBC.<br/>However, she says China's \"ability to manufacture high-end equipment and components is an estimated 10 to 15 years behind global leaders.\"<br/>The US' biggest advantage is Silicon Valley, arguably the world's supreme entrepreneurial hotspot. It is the birthplace of technology giants such as Google, Apple and Intel that have helped shape modern life.<br/>Innovators in the country have been helped by its unique research culture, says Pascale Fung, director of the Center for Artificial Intelligence Research at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.<br/>Researchers often spend years working to improve a technology without a product in mind, Ms Fung says.<br/>OpenAI, for example, operated as a non-profit company for years as it researched the Transformers machine learning model, which eventually powered ChatGPT.<br/>\"This environment never existed in most Chinese companies. They would build deep learning systems or large language models only after they saw the popularity,\" she adds. \"This is a fundamental challenge to Chinese AI.\"<br/>US investors have also been supportive of the country's research push. In 2019, Microsoft said it would put $1bn (\u00a3810,000) in to OpenAI.<br/>\"AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time and has the potential to help solve many of our world's most pressing challenges,\" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said.<br/>China, meanwhile, benefits from a larger consumer base. It is the world's second-most populous country, home to roughly 1.4 billion people.<br/>It also has a thriving internet sector, says Edith Yeung, a partner at the Race Capital investment firm.<br/>Nearly everyone in the country uses the super app WeChat, for example. It is used for almost everything from sending text messages, to booking doctor's appointments and filing taxes.<br/>As a result, there's a wealth of information that can be used to improve products. \"The AI model is going to be only as good as the data that is available for it to learn from,\" Ms Yeung says.<br/>\"For good or bad, China has a lot less rules around privacy, and a lot more data [compared to the US]. There's CCTV facial recognition everywhere, for example,\" she adds. \"Imagine how useful that would be for AI-generated images.\"<br/>While China's tech community may appear to be lagging behind the US, its developers have an edge, according to Lee Kai-Fu, who makes the argument in his book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order.<br/>\"They live in a world where speed is essential, copying is an accepted practice, and competitors will stop at nothing to win a new market,\" wrote Mr Lee, a prominent figure in Beijing's internet sector and the former head of Google China.<br/>\"This rough-and-tumble environment makes a strong contrast to Silicon Valley, where copying is stigmatised and many companies are allowed to coast on the basis of one original idea or lucky break.\"<br/>China's copycat era has its problems, including serious issues around intellectual property. Mr Lee writes that it has led to a generation of hardy and nimble entrepreneurs ready to compete.<br/>Since the 1980s, China has been expanding its economy, which used to be based mainly on manufacturing, to one that is technology-based, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"In the last decade, we have seen more innovation from Chinese consumer-driven internet companies and high-end Chinese designs,\" she adds.<br/>While Chinese tech companies certainly have unique advantages, the full impact of Beijing's authoritarianism is still unclear.<br/>There are questions, for instance, about whether censorship would affect development of Chinese AI chatbots. Will they be able to answer sensitive questions about President Xi Jinping?<br/>\"I don't think anyone in China will ask controversial questions on Baidu or Ernie in the first place. They know it's censored,\" Ms Yeung says. \"Sensitive topics are a very small part of the usage [of chatbots]. They just get more media attention,\" Ms Fung adds.<br/>The bigger concern is that US attempts to restrict China's access to specialised tech can stymie the latter's AI industry.<br/>High-performing computer chips, or semiconductors, are now the source of much tension between Washington and Beijing. They are used in everyday products including laptops and smartphones, and could have military applications. They are also crucial to the hardware required for AI learning.<br/>US companies like Nvidia currently have the lead in developing AI chips and \"few [Chinese] companies can compete against ChatGPT\" given export restrictions, Ms Fung says.<br/>While this will hit China's high-tech industries like cutting edge AI, it won't affect the production of consumer technology, such as mobiles and laptops. This is because \"the export controls are designed to prevent China from developing advanced AI for military purposes,\" Ms Schaefer says.<br/>To overcome this, China needs its own Silicon Valley - a research culture that attracts talent from diverse backgrounds, Ms Fung says.<br/>\"So far it has relied on both domestic talent and those from overseas with Chinese heritage. There is a limit to homogeneous cultural thinking,\" she adds.<br/>Beijing has been trying to close the gap through its \"Big Fund\", which offers massive incentives to chip companies.<br/>But it has also tightened its grip on the sector. In March, Zhao Weiguo became the latest technology tycoon to be accused of corruption by authorities.<br/>Beijing's focus on certain industries can bring financial incentives and loosen red tape, but it may also mean greater scrutiny, and more fear and uncertainty.<br/>\"Zhao's arrest is a message for other state-owned firms: don't mess around with state money, particularly in the chip space,\" Ms Schaefer says. \"Now it's time to get on with the job.\"<br/>How that message will affect the future of China's AI industry remains to be seen.<br/>China bans major US chip maker from key projects<br/>China tech giant Alibaba to roll out ChatGPT rival<br/>OpenAI announces ChatGPT successor GPT-4<br/>Students warned against using AI for assignments<br/>'Google killer' ChatGPT sparks AI chatbot race<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Huge arrays of angled solar panels sit atop jet black steel supports, soaking up the sun and shading the vehicles beneath. <br/>Outside the offices of a major car manufacturer in the south of England, there are now more than 2,000 panels in total with a peak capacity of just under 1 megawatt (MW).<br/>That's enough to power hundreds of homes.<br/>\"They are looking stunning,\" declares Guy Chilvers, business development manager at SIG, the firm that supplied the solar canopies.<br/>These structures make car parks more visually appealing, he insists, while admitting, \"I would say that\".<br/>Solar car parks or car ports enable electricity production in open spaces that tend to be positioned conveniently near to energy-guzzling facilities such as hospitals, shopping centres or offices. The canopies have additional benefits in that they protect cars from rain and snow, or hot sun in the summer.<br/>In a drive to boost clean energy production, the French Senate recently approved legislation that makes it mandatory for all existing and new car parks with 80 spaces or more to be covered by solar panels. <br/>While there is no equivalent requirement in the UK, solar car parks have been around for years and there are signs that they are beginning to boom here. With electricity prices currently still elevated, many businesses are turning to on-site renewables to try to keep costs down in the long run. <br/>There is a huge opportunity to turn more British car parks into solar farms, according to a new report published by the countryside charity CPRE and the UCL Energy Institute.<br/>\"We think the total potential in the built environment is about 117GW,\" says Prof Mark Barrett of UCL. \"And of that, 11GW, we think, is car parks.\"<br/>For context, the UK currently has around 15GW of solar capacity in total and requires 40GW by 2030 in order to meet net zero targets, according to Solar Energy UK.<br/>Prof Barrett notes that the figure of 11GW is conservative and is based on an estimate of 130 sq km of available car parks in the UK - lower than the 200 sq km estimated by estate agents Knight Frank. The CPRE and UCL report also assumed that 50% of each individual car park would be covered by a canopy rather than 100%.<br/>Whichever way you look at it, there's plenty of space out there in car parks for solar panels and people are beginning to realise this. <br/>\"It's absolutely gone crazy,\" says Mr Chilvers, referring to his inbox. Lately, he's quoted for hotels, hospitals and leisure centres. Mr Chilvers and his colleagues design and build the steel structures for solar canopies while the panels are supplied separately.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Rival companies that spoke to the BBC also described high demand for solar car park canopies.<br/>Praxia Energy, based in Spain, supplies about 3MW of car park solar installations in the UK each year and says it expects this to grow tenfold by 2028. <br/>A spokeswoman for Veolia says the company recently installed a 1.1MW solar canopy system in the car park of Eastbourne Hospital and the firm has registered increased demand for solar infrastructure in the UK lately. <br/>Solarsense, a company in Clevedon, says it has also received rising enquiries in recent months.<br/>Tim Evans, chief executive of 3ti, argues that, in the past, the UK has been slow to pursue this technology in comparison with countries on the continent. \"We are quite some way behind the curve,\" he says.<br/>There are some flagship examples already in place, though. The largest solar car park installed to date in the UK is the one at the Bentley car factory in Crewe, which has a peak capacity of 2.7MW. <br/>Mr Evans says he is currently exploring four new potential projects with clients that could exceed 5MW peak capacity.<br/>Solar panels in car parks can also power electric vehicle (EV) charging. This works especially well at offices, where employees' cars are parked outside for many hours. Shopping centres, football stadiums, leisure centres and cinemas are also suitable venues, since cars tend to be parked for two hours or more to allow sufficient charging, says Mr Evans. <br/>But the steel supports required for many solar canopies do add to the cost. It is often cheaper to simply put solar panels on the roof of large buildings, such as supermarkets. Mr Evans estimates that rooftop solar yields electricity at about 9p per kWh currently, versus 14p or 15p per kWh from panels in car parks.<br/>There aren't many other obvious downsides to the canopies, though, says Richard Watkins at the University of Kent. He notes that installers might want to fit them with efficient under-canopy lighting so that they don't result in dark, potentially dangerous spaces at night.<br/>One hiccup facing many renewable energy projects at the moment is a lack of grid connections, since surplus energy generated by solar panels, for example, must be handled by the grid. Billions of pounds worth of renewable installations are effectively on hold because of this issue, according to BBC research.<br/>\"I've just had a megawatt car park, beautiful car park, for a factory turned down because it can't get a grid connection,\" says Mr Chilvers. <br/>A spokesman for Solar Energy UK also highlights this problem, saying that solar car parks becoming a common sight will remain a \"distant prospect\" until it is resolved.<br/>The energy industry regulator Ofgem is looking at ways to speed up connections and National Grid also has a plan to improve the process.<br/>There are lots of other locations around the UK, besides car parks, that could also accommodate solar installations and help us ditch fossil fuels, notes Prof Sara Walker at Newcastle University. Cycle paths and railways, for instance, or reservoirs that can be covered with floating solar panels. These also help reduce the evaporative loss of water from reservoirs.<br/>\"Where we can co-locate solar photovoltaics alongside infrastructure that would be there anyway, like a car park, it enables us to get double use out of the land surface,\" she says.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

On inspection, the gel has been pushed around a bit but, amazingly, is still intact.<br/>What's important is that the metal plate behind the gel is not damaged. Without the gel the basalt would have torn a chunk out of the plate.<br/>Talin can absorb force thanks to unique mechanical properties. Its structure includes spirals of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - which form bundles. When pulled the bundles unfurl, increasing the length of the protein by a factor of 10.<br/>When the stress is released the bundles snap back into their original position, kind of like a spring.<br/>Prof Ben Goult worked out the structure of talin and how it responds to forces and, with his colleague Prof Jennifer Hiscock, they came up with the idea of making talin into a shock-absorbing material.<br/>\"I literally wandered into Ben's office and he was talking about his wonderful protein. And I said we have to make a bulletproof vest - this is what we have to do,\" she says.<br/>Starting in 2016 their team developed a way to join the talin proteins together into a lattice - like a net with an almost cartoon-like ability to stretch and rebound.<br/>It's been a long haul for Prof Goult who has been involved with working out the mechanical properties of talin and its structure since 2005.<br/>\"It wasn't easy. It took a team of six of us over four years to work out the protein structure of talin, and another four years to work out how talin responded to force\" he says.<br/>Proteins are complicated molecules to decipher. They are made up of a chain of amino acids, a bit like beads on a string. There are 20 different naturally occurring amino acids - or beads - so there are a bewildering number of ways they can combine. <br/>Traditionally working out those structures was done using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a process which could take years.<br/>But in recent years artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionised the process, predicting the structures of hundreds of millions of proteins.<br/>A key event came in November 2020, when AlphaFold performed best at CASP 14, an assessment every two years where different computer programs predict the structure of proteins. <br/>Not only did AlphaFold outperform rival systems, it predicted the structure of the proteins with a level of accuracy way beyond its rivals.<br/>\"That was pretty crazy,\" says Kathryn Tunyasuvunakool, who helped develop AlphaFold, along with others at London-based DeepMind, the AI division of Alphabet, the parent company of Google.<br/>\"We knew that we had pretty good results internally going into that CASP. But it wasn't at all clear whether other people would have similar results. It was, I guess, a bit of a surprise to us to see just how large the margin was compared to other groups,\" says Ms Tunyasuvunakool.<br/>That version of AlphaFold - AlphaFold2 - was so good, that in the next competition all the best performing teams used versions of it. <br/>Thanks to AlphaFold and its offspring the database of protein structures has gone from a few hundred thousand to hundreds of millions.<br/>For scientists and researchers, particularly in drug development, this is a bonanza. Proteins with structures that look promising for certain uses, like binding to a cancer cell, can be identified more quickly than ever before - the pace of research has been accelerated.<br/>But even AlphaFold has its limitations. Proteins often work by interacting with other molecules and at the moment AlphaFold can only predict the protein part.<br/>And as Prof Goult discovered with talin, proteins are dynamic molecules that change form. AlphaFold can gives researchers a static picture, but can't model those changes.<br/>Also, scientists might also want to design proteins from scratch, to do specific tasks. That's the focus of Prof David Baker, head of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington, just outside Seattle.<br/>His team has developed an artificial intelligence based on DALL-E, an AI which generates original images.<br/>Called RF Diffusion, it was trained by breaking down known proteins and then reassembling them in steps. <br/>Scientists using RF Diffusion decide on a particular characteristic they want from a new protein - perhaps a catalyst for a certain kind of chemical reaction, or a protein that can bind to a particular target.<br/>They can feed their requirements into RF Diffusion and it will come up with a suitable protein structure.<br/>\"I think RF diffusion is a step change compared to what we had before,\" says Prof Baker.<br/>\"The potential of designing proteins that solve so many different problems is really great,\" he adds.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Industry might benefit from catalysts which can speed up reactions or make them more efficient.<br/>Plus, according to Prof Baker, whole new materials could emerge. For him, the possibilities make protein research a compelling place to work. <br/>\"It's an extremely exciting area right now. For young scientists just starting out on a career, it's probably one of the most exciting areas in science today,\" he says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Back in Kent, Professors Goult and Hiscock are working on scaling up production of their protein talin, with investment coming from the Ministry of Defence.<br/>The idea is to make enough of their shock-absorbing gel for a much bigger test. The Kent scientists think that one day their gel might be able to reduce the amount of heavy ceramic used in today's bulletproof plates. <br/>For now, Prof Hiscock still marvels at how their protein gel comes together.<br/>\"It's a beautiful process, the spontaneity of it, and the fact that all those molecules can come together to form those fibrous networks.\" <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Real Housewives of Salt Lake City Star Jen Shah is serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence there for wire fraud.<br/>The celebrity entrepreneur might have roommates in prison. Inmates are typically housed in dormitory-style two-person bunk beds, and four to eight person cubicles, according to Pink Lady Prison Consultants, a prison consulting group led by formerly incarcerated people. <br/>Life at the federal facility is centred around work and extracurricular programmes, the prison handbook says. <br/>All inmates are expected to work, and earn between 12 cents and $1.15 (\u00a30.90) an hour for their jobs. Many are involved in food service and factory work. <br/>Outside of their work, female inmates can take classes on business skills and foreign languages, watch television, play sports and go to religious services, according to the handbook.<br/>Holmes would be allotted an hour for each meal at the facility, which offers a standard Federal Bureau of Prisons menu, consisting of foods like chicken, hamburgers, hotdogs, tacos and macaroni. <br/>As per the prison handbook, she could speak to her family via video calls. Inmates are also allowed visitors during weekends and holidays, but like other inmates, Holmes would be allowed limited physical contact with her partner and young children.<br/>Rules at the female-only facility are also strict, the handbook says, adding that inmates are \"treated in a mature and responsible manner\" and are \"expected to act accordingly\". <br/>Inmates can face disciplinary measures for a number of actions, including not keeping their cell or room neat, sleeping past the early designated wake-up hour, sharing their phone account with other inmates, and leaving an area during an official inmate rollcall, which happens five times a day. <br/>Holmes' time behind bars will stand in stark contrast to her past life. Once lauded as the \"next Steve Jobs\", the start-up founder was said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire, making the cover of Forbes and other prominent magazines. <br/>She started Theranos shortly after dropping out of Stanford University. As the leader of the company, she raised millions of dollars from high-profile investors, including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.<br/>But the start-up fell apart in 2018 after it was revealed Holmes and other executives had lied about the company's technology. The blood-testing device was purported to be able to run a multitude of tests from just a few drops of blood.<br/>In addition to serving time in prison, Holmes has been ordered to pay $452m to the victims of her fraud. She will split the amount with her former romantic and business partner, Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, who started serving a 13-year sentence in prison in April. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>The rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes<br/>The prison experience Holmes is desperate to avoid<br/>Elizabeth Holmes to begin jail sentence this month<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

So his grandparents gave him $200 (\u00a3159) Apple credit for Christmas.<br/>\"To my shock, he spent all of it in a matter of days,\" says Ms Ward. \"After that, I gave him no more than $10 worth of robux per month. He quickly became frustrated and bored with the game.\" <br/>Leif moved on to World of Tanks, which also requires players to upgrade their weaponry using PlayStation credit. <br/>\"However, this game has the option to watch ads to gain credit,\" says Ms Ward. \"He would do that out of desperation when he had used up his monthly gaming allowance.\"<br/>Ms Ward says her younger son has yet to learn self-control or money-sense. <br/>\"It's something that I have to police constantly.\"<br/>Rather than profiting from the initial sale of a video game, many of today's gaming companies rely on revenue generated by in-game purchases, or microtransactions.<br/>The content purchased can be purely aesthetic - dance moves, skins or clothing. <br/>Alternatively, in-game purchases can provide a tactical advantage to the gameplay - extra lives, character upgrades or weapons - providing a lead over players who did not purchase the additional content.<br/>The global online microtransaction market is forecast to grow from $67.94bn in 2022 to $76.66bn in 2023.<br/>However, there are signs of a backlash from experts and consumers alike. Also, some companies are promising new releases that are in-game purchase-free.<br/>Gaming companies use behavioural psychology to manipulate users into spending, says Prof Sarah Mills, and the link between gaming and gambling is becoming \"increasingly blurred\", she explains.<br/>Ms Mills is professor of human geography at Loughborough University. Her research found gambling techniques make gamers play for longer and spend more money, and drive repeat buying.<br/>Vicki Shotbolt, chief executive of Parent Zone, an organisation which helps parents navigate the digital world for their children, is more specific about how games incentivise players to part with their money.<br/>By spending players can \"avoid the grind\" - where making an in-game purchase means you avoid hours of monotonous gaming to progress to another level.<br/>\"Fun pain\" is where you risk losing something important if you don't make a purchase.<br/>Meanwhile, \"obfuscation techniques\", like in-game currencies, make it hard to see how much you're really spending.<br/>Another tactic is the use of \"loot boxes\". Players buy a box without knowing what's inside. It could contain a game-changing item - but more often than not the prize is nothing more than a mediocre customisation. <br/>\"Young people recalled senses of shame when they reflected on the amount they spent trying to gain a rare item, even if they were successful,\" says Prof Mills.<br/>And - despite many children saying they dislike in-game purchasing - spending money on microtransactions has become an expectation.<br/>While spending on games has risen, some argue that playing games can benefit young people and fears are exaggerated.<br/>Gaming as a form of play has been found to relieve stress, help develop cognitive skills and combat loneliness.<br/>As a teenager Zhenghua Yang, from Colorado, spent two years in hospital.<br/>\"I played a lot of video games. The single-player games made me feel like a hero. The multiplayer games connected me to other people. I made life-long friends all over the world.\"<br/>In 2014, Mr Yang founded Serenity Forge, a gaming company on a mission to help others. To date, more than 20 million people have played the firm's games.<br/>\"We are in the business of expanding people's horizons,\" says Mr Yang.<br/>Serenity Forge does not use microtransactions but, says Mr Yang, that could change in the future if they found them to contribute to \"meaningful, emotionally impactful games that challenge the way you think\".<br/>The impact of microtransactions, says Mr Yang, depends on the vulnerability of the user.<br/>\"Like a credit card can be dangerous for someone in an inappropriate context, so too can microtransactions. However, credit cards can also serve an important function and in-game purchases can be important to a gamer engaging with their favourite game.\"<br/>Sarah Loya's son Andrew, 14, spends almost all his pocket money on gaming but, she says, that isn't a problem and gaming makes him happy.<br/>\"He plays daily, after school and on the weekends. I don't really see much of a negative. He's a smart kid and knows the difference between reality and fantasy.\"<br/>Ms Loya lives in Texas with Andrew, and his brother Rex, 6.<br/>\"My bank account is linked to Andrew's subscription, so I would see if he purchased something without permission,\" says the 43-year-old, \"but he always asks me before making a purchase.\"<br/>More technology of business:<br/>While it can be difficult for parents to keep track of registered emails, passwords and payment cards across various platforms and devices - there are ways that you can protect your teen and your bank account.<br/>Child accounts and parental controls can be used to disable purchases or set a spending limit. Parents can set up email notifications to flag purchases, and use gift cards rather than credit cards.<br/>Perhaps most importantly, adds Mr Yang, talk to your child.<br/>\"In my experience, friction stems from a lack of parental presence,\" he says. \"I now have two kids and, instead of using games as a babysitting tool, I make sure I'm present in their lives as they consume media.\"<br/>Back in Barbados, Ms Ward has set up screen time limits and passcodes to keep Leif gaming safely. <br/>\"My password is needed to make any purchases and if he wants money added to his account he has to ask me.

In a bid to encourage homeowners to decarbonise their heating, Germany introduced a rebate scheme in January 2023 that offers up to 40% back on the cost of buying and installing a heat pump. <br/>Heat pumps use energy taken from the air, water or ground to provide both heating and cooling. They have been proven to work even in extreme temperatures and can drastically reduce energy bills once installed.<br/>The scheme is just one of a host of heat pump subsidies in place across Europe and part of a broader push to reduce carbon emissions. From 2024, every new heating system installed in Germany must run on 65% renewable energy.<br/>Bastian Distler, a product manager in Ketsch in south-west Germany, was considering upgrading to a heat pump anyway for environmental reasons, but admits that he wouldn't have been able to without the subsidy. Purchase and installation can cost anywhere from \u20ac10,000 to \u20ac30,000 (\u00a38,700 to \u00a326,000; $11,000 to $33,000) compared to around \u20ac7,000 for a new gas boiler.<br/>\"I have two little children which makes you question some behaviours and you feel better if you do something good for the environment. But to be very honest, if it had been very, very expensive and it didn't pay off, I probably would not have done it,\" says Mr Distler.<br/>While the scheme is certainly making it easier for Germans to invest in heating system upgrades, heat pump sales were already on the increase. <br/>\"We had a market growth of 53% last year,\" says Martin Sabel, managing director of the German Heat Pump Association. \"The year before it was around 30% and the year before that around 40%. So we've had a good growth rate for several years now.\"<br/>The dramatic uptick in demand caught many manufacturers off guard, leaving some homeowners waiting up to 10 months before their new heat pumps could be supplied and installed by trained technicians, who are also in short supply.<br/>Manufacturers like Viessmann are scaling up production to solve the shortfall, as well as pouring huge investment into training installers, providing educational materials for would-be buyers, and helping customers navigate often complex subsidy applications.<br/>G\u00fcnther Schlachter, vice president of residential electric solutions at Viessmann, believes that supporting and training installers is key to decarbonising home heating. <br/>\"Our installer... can consult with their customers [and advise against] the cheapest gas or oil option to make use of the subsidies that are now in place for a future-proof solution,\" says Mr Schlachter.<br/>J\u00fcrgen Fischer, president of climate solutions at Danfoss agrees. \"Typically, installers focus on gas. For a heat pump, they need to also understand electrics and refrigeration. So educating the end user is important, but it's more important to educate the person selling the system because 80% of the decision-making process happens with the installer.\"<br/>Most European countries currently face the same issues with supply, installer training and cost, but geography and culture also heavily influence what we expect and demand from our heating systems.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>So perhaps it is not surprising that Europe's coldest countries, with the best insulation, have the highest heat pump penetration. According to the International Energy Agency, 60% of Norway's buildings are fitted with a heat pump, followed closely by Sweden at 43% and Finland at 41%. <br/>In Germany the figure is a little over 4% and in the UK just 1%.<br/>\"Scandinavia is much more advanced because they have higher insulation standards and moved from direct electric heating to heat pumps early because it's saved them from day one,\" says Thomas Nowak, secretary general of the European Heat Pump Association.<br/>Central Europeans also tend to have high expectations of heating and insulation whereas people in the UK have long accepted the need for draught excluders and chunky indoor jumpers.<br/>Southern countries tend to eschew heating in favour of cooling and use instantaneous gas boilers to heat water, whereas Eastern Europeans often rely on solid fuel stoves. <br/>Regardless of where you live or how old your building is, there's an easy way to find out if your home is suitable for a heat pump. <br/>If you can feel comfortable at home when the flow temperature on your boiler is reduced to 55C, then you can install a heat pump straight away without retrofits or insulation upgrades. <br/>Of course, not everyone can choose how their home is heated. Germany has one of the lowest home ownership rates in Europe, which means the onus is on landlords and housing management companies to upgrade heating to serve the country's approximately 40 million tenants. <br/>The German Heat Pump Association has seen housing providers begin to understand that decarbonisation will soon begin to affect their bottom line. <br/>\"They have the goal of decarbonising their building stock because they realise that if they don't, in 10 or 20 years, they won't be able to rent these flats anymore,\" says Martin Sabel. <br/>Tenants who would prefer to take matters into their own hands may soon be able to access smaller-scale heat pump solutions for heating and cooling individual rooms.<br/>US start-up Gradient hopes to enter the European market in 2023 and is working on producing small, affordable, self-install heat pumps that fit over window sills and can replace existing air conditioning units. <br/>For Viessmann, the long-term vision is to build a holistic low-carbon, low-cost energy system where heat pumps, high-quality insulation, solar energy, rerouted waste heat, other renewables, and smart technology work in tandem to provide a circular system of heating and cooling, charging cars, and meeting other energy needs for homeowners and their wider community. <br/>Germany may still be a long way from that, but heat pumps are a good step on that road. When asked what message homeowners should take home about heat pumps, Thomas Nowak has a simple answer. <br/>\"They work. That's all. Don't trust anybody who tells you they don't.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

But that is changing. <br/>Operators are increasingly adopting turbines designed to withstand tropical cyclones. One of the latest examples is a \"typhoon-resistant\" floating wind turbine, which will soon help to power an offshore oil platform in China. <br/>According to the manufacturer, MingYang Smart Energy, this 7.25 megawatt (MW) turbine can survive wind speeds of up to 134mph for 10 minutes. It has been installed at a facility 136km off the coast of the island province of Hainan.<br/>MingYang did not respond to a BBC request for comment but theirs is not the first turbine designed to face down such an onslaught. In 2021, US firm GE received typhoon-certification for its mammoth Haliade-X turbine. It is fixed, not floating, and has a capacity of up to 13MW.<br/>The blistering growth of the wind energy industry is pushing turbines to their limits and some question whether the pace of the rollout is wise.<br/>While components such as turbine blades are remarkably strong, they are not indestructible. And the forces of nature, especially out at sea, are notoriously unpredictable, meaning the pressure is on to prove that wind turbines really are hurricane-ready.<br/>Tropical cyclones - often called typhoons or hurricanes depending on location - are a familiar threat in certain parts of the world, including in the Gulf of Mexico or around much of Southeast Asia.<br/>Such storms can produce wind speeds well in excess of 100mph. The strongest one-minute sustained winds on record, of 215mph, were created by Hurricane Patricia in the Eastern Pacific in 2015. <br/>Despite the meteorological challenges in such regions, the expansion of wind energy is expected there in the coming years and decades.<br/>Today's turbines already put up with some powerful gales. Those positioned off the northeast coast of the UK in the North Sea operate in wind speeds of up to 50mph or so, after which point they are switched off, notes Simon Hogg at Durham University, who holds the \u00d8rsted chair at the university, which is funded by energy firm \u00d8rsted. <br/>Technically, such turbines are designed to survive even higher wind speeds.<br/>Leon Mishnaevsky of the Technical University of Denmark suggests that wind turbine blades are generally quite reliable. These days, they are made from strong but lightweight carbon fibre composites and automated manufacturing processes help to ensure the uniform placement of the fibres, which is important for the blades' robustness, he notes.<br/>Wind turbine makers also perform a range of stress tests on blades to ensure that they are up to scratch.<br/>This can include attaching large \"exciters\" to the blades, which bounce up and down, simulating the repeated stresses of winds on the structure. Giant blades are also sometimes bent to the point of breaking, says Prof Hogg, which helps to confirm the maximum loads they can bear.<br/>But the fallibility of turbines, especially the biggest ones, is becoming more apparent as time goes by. Insurer GCube notes in a recent report that offshore wind losses rose from \u00a31m in 2012 to more than \u00a37m in 2021.<br/>Plus, machines with capacities larger than 8MW can suffer component failures within just two years of installation, the firm says, more than twice as fast as 4-8MW devices.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>Some of the most dangerous forces to trouble turbine blades are torsion, or twisting, loads, says Find M\u00f8lholt Jensen, chief executive of Bladena, a firm that specialises in diagnosing and repairing large turbine blades around 60m in length, or longer. <br/>Repeated twisting of blades can induce difficult-to-spot fractures, he says: \"The damage cannot be seen from the outside.\"<br/>The longer the blade, the greater the risk, comments a spokesman for Bladena.<br/>Current testing and industry standards are not sufficient to prove that the largest turbine blades can withstand these stresses, argues Dr Jensen.<br/>New designs could help, though. In Japan, Challenergy has been working on a turbine with tall, vertical blades that spin around a central tower.<br/>While currently much smaller and less powerful than the biggest traditional, three-bladed turbines in operation today, Challenergy's device is intended to cope with very high winds. <br/>When a powerful typhoon called Hin Nam No struck the Philippines and Japan last August, it passed over two of the company's turbines. One of the devices, at Ishigaki City in Okinawa, recorded wind speeds of around 64mph. The turbine continued to operate without any problems, according to Challenergy.<br/>In the US, a research team has taken a cue from nature in their design of an alternative hurricane-resistant turbine. <br/>\"We were inspired by palm trees,\" explains Lucy Pao at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"In high winds they kind of go with the flow, they bend with the wind.\"<br/>She and her colleagues designed a prototype two-bladed wind turbine design with flexible blades. Plus, the rotor faces downwind rather than into the wind, as is common in traditional configurations, helping it to absorb the impact of strong gales.<br/>During tests at an onshore site in Colorado, the blade tips were observed deflecting by up to 600mm, more than half a metre. \"None of them snapped,\" says Prof Pao.<br/>Wind speeds in the area can reach 100mph in the wintertime, she adds.<br/>However, the wind energy industry has almost universally adopted the upwind, three-bladed design so selling a new concept is difficult, Prof Pao explains. Currently, her research in this area is on hold, pending further funding.<br/>She shares the concerns of other observers who question whether wind turbines are really ready for some of the strongest winds nature can hurl at them.<br/>\"The novel materials, they are stronger, they are pretty amazing, but I don't know that they've been tested out as thoroughly as maybe they should be,\" she says.<br/>Then there are the tricky economics of siting turbines in places where winds are especially variable. James Martin is chief executive at Gulf Wind Technology, a company exploring the deployment of turbines in the Gulf of Mexico. <br/>In this area, low wind speeds are common for most of the year - with the occasional hurricane blasting its way through. <br/>\"If you design that turbine to be strong enough to withstand the peak wind event, then you'll be carrying a lot of extra cost for the times that you've got light wind,\" notes Mr Martin. He declines to share details of the turbines or technologies his firm is considering.<br/>In the coming years, you can expect to see more and more turbines arriving in regions affected by cyclones, though.<br/>\"We need [turbines] there as much as we need them in any other area of the globe,\" argues Prof Hogg. \"I don't think we should shy away from it.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

We each have our own stick and box, and are meant to strike the box with the stick in sync with a light pattern. But of course I'm also watching the robot - and I'm aware that it's watching me.<br/>This drumming experiment has been designed to test how the presence of a robot doing the same task affects a human's behaviour.<br/>It's one of many experiments of human-robot interaction being carried out by the research group CONTACT (Cognitive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa.<br/>Though I'm aware of the lights and the other people in the room, my gaze keeps being drawn to the iCub's heavy white eyelids.<br/>For one thing, there's a noticeable noise when the robot blinks every few seconds. And, because this childlike robot has expressive, oversized eyes, its gaze is compelling. <br/>This matters because with blinking, as with other aspects of eye gaze, there's more than strictly meets the eye.<br/>\"While it is often assumed that blinking is just a reflexive physiological function associated with protective functions and ocular lubrication, it also serves an important role in reciprocal interaction,\" comments Helena Kiilavuori, a psychology researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland.<br/>Human blinking conveys attention and emotion. As a means of non-verbal communication, it expresses a number of things we aren't consciously aware of, such as who should take a turn in a conversation.<br/>Thus, it's just one of many social signals humans exchange constantly without being aware of them, yet while deriving a great deal of information and comfort from them.<br/>So social roboticists have been studying both the physical and psychological properties of human blinking to understand why it might be useful to match it in robots.<br/>\"Due to the many important functions of blinking in human behaviour, it could be assumed that having robots blinking their eyes could significantly enhance their perceived human-likeness. This could, in turn, facilitate human-robot interaction,\" says Ms Kiilavuori.<br/>Put another way, \"When the robot's blinking well,\u202fpeople feel for your character,\" says David Hanson, who leads Hanson Robotics.<br/>Indeed, CONTACT research with 13-year-olds and adults in Italy shows that both groups simply like blinking robots more. An unblinking robot can give a person the unpleasant impression of being stared at, points out Alessandra Sciutti, who leads the CONTACT unit.<br/>Humans also perceive robots that blink more naturally as more intelligent. And intelligence matters in situations where humans depend on robots to provide information, such as in train stations.<br/>Despite the benefits of natural-looking blinking, integrating it into robots (apart from avatars and robots with screen displays for faces) is technically challenging.<br/>\"Blinks are one of the subtlest of human movements, so designing mechanisms that can mimic these movements require advanced technology, such as high-precision motors,\" Ms Kiilavuori explains. The roboticists at Engineered Arts, for example, use expensive, aerospace-grade motors as well as designing their own control electronics.  <br/>Specifically, says Mr Hanson of Hanson Robotics, \"The speed of the motors moving skin material when blinking is really challenging and making the shape of the eye look natural while blinking is happening is also challenging. As well as reducing friction between artificial eyelids and the eye surface itself.\"<br/>Another issue here is a trade-off between the speed and sound of motorised blinking. Francesco Rea, a senior technician at the CONTACT unit, says that in the iCub robot a quieter motor could dampen the sound of a blink. But the slower movement then makes the robot look sleepy or catlike. <br/>Very slow blinks also risk a loss of visual information, as the iCub's camera is located behind the eyes. \"In vision, missing two frames is not that big an issue,\" says Mr Rea. \"Missing ten frames starts to be an issue.\"<br/>Ms Kiilavuori adds, \"Another challenge is the correct timing and duration of blinks.\" The different functions that blinking performs - such as how a person changes blinking speed while telling a lie - involve different eyelid dynamics as well as different emotional states.<br/>\"Any deviation from the natural and appropriate blinking times and duration, in a given context, can make the robot appear odd and disturbing,\" she says.<br/>More technology of business:<br/>The CONTACT team use a software program that partially randomises the intervals between single and double blinking. After all, blinking fixedly wouldn't look very natural either. <br/>Over at Disney Research, roboticists have joined forces with character animators to develop a research prototype for realistic robotic gaze. The aim is to design an expressive system of eye gaze that is easy for animators to control in order to convey subtle emotion.<br/>With elements like motion curves of eyelids, \"we can kind of isolate these individual behaviours, which makes it much easier to really concentrate on getting small aspects and small details correct,\" says James Kennedy, a research scientist at Disney Research.<br/>They've patented their system of robotic sensing and control of eye gaze. This includes software for processing images taken by a camera in the robot's chest, and generating control signals for movements like opening and closing the eyelids. <br/>Mr Kennedy says that the research remains more experimental, and isn't yet being applied in Disney's theme parks. \"The goal here was to really select a single social cue that we were interested in and push it as far as we could in making lifelike believable motion and behaviour\u202fthat we felt would provide a platform for engagement with people.\" <br/>The technology would need to be refined in order, for instance, for the eye gaze system to remain believable in longer close-up interactions with humans.<br/>Another general challenge would be getting humanoid robots to begin syncing their blinking patterns to those of humans, as humans do in conversation. <br/>These types of challenges remain compelling to some roboticists. And, contrary to exaggerated pop culture depictions of androids that are indistinguishable from humans, blinking is one tiny example of the many complexities that still keep robotic interactions from seeming completely natural.  <br/>When trying to replicate a mechanism as tiny and sometimes underappreciated as blinking, \"actually you reveal how complex this mechanism is, and then how much subtle movement there is,\" notes Mr Kennedy. \"And that's where we have this really great opportunity for exploration and invention.\"\u202f <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Or was it?<br/>Coral, who is based in Malaysia, heard of a website called TimeRepublik, which describes itself as \"a timebank for the internet era\".<br/>Time banking is in essence a more sophisticated form of bartering. You don't pay someone in money for a job that they do for you. Instead you give that person time credits that they can then use to get a service without financial payment from someone else.<br/>Via the TimeRepublik website, Coral was able to connect with Cherish Cullison, a New York-based professional wardrobe stylist and costume designer.<br/>Over Zoom, Cherish was able to help Coral find the modern clothing that best suited her.<br/>\"She styled me very well,\" says Coral. \"No money can pay for such a transaction, it is priceless, it is based on trust.\"<br/>The two have stayed in touch after they first met on TimeRepublik a few years ago. This has included Coral returning the favour of assistance, and giving Cherish some meditation lessons.<br/>Cherish says it is good that \"the expectation of money is out of the way\". <br/>\"Instead you really get to the core of things and you discover something, I think, that's greater and sort of priceless.\"<br/>TimeRepublik is the brainchild of Swiss co-founders Gabriele Donati and Karim Varini. They launched the first version in Switzerland back in 2012, but international expansion has come in the past couple of years.<br/>The website is free to use for members of the public. Users offering a service earn a \"TimeCoin\" credit. This amounts to 15 minutes no matter what job you provide, be it cutting the lawn of a neighbour, or maths tuition via a video call.<br/>You simply advertise what you are offering and how long it would take in TimeCoins. <br/>\"We wanted to distance ourselves from financial transactions and find something that could create relationships between people,\" says Mr Donati. \"Because we truly believe that only through our relationships, you can gain the trust of another person.\"<br/>TimeRepublik is today based in both Lugano, Switzerland and New York, and says it has more than 100,000 users around the world. It makes money by selling the service to companies who then offer it to their staff via their internal websites. <br/>The concept of time banking has been around since the 19th Century. Mr Donati says that he wanted to bring it to a younger, and more digitally-savvy audience.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Another organisation helping to take time banking online is charity Timebanking UK. This offers assistance and software to help communities and organisations across the UK set up their own time-banking schemes.<br/>The platforms allow users to post offers and requests, log hours and leave feedback.<br/>Timebanking UK's chief executive Sarah Bird highlights the built-in safeguarding features, such as users being able to flag any problems. \"So if something goes wrong with the local time bank, we can just jump in there and see if we can fix things,\" she says.<br/>Ms Bird also explains that while time banking does not replace professional services or government programmes, it can underpin them, and engage people who would not usually do traditional volunteering.<br/>She adds that the Department for Work and Pensions allows jobseekers to claim time-banking hours towards their time spent looking for paid employment.<br/>\"Time banking might be the first step that someone will take from long-term unemployment before they go on to maybe volunteer or on a training course, because it's a method of making that person feel more confident about themselves,\" says Ms Bird.<br/>Timebanking UK has also set up similar schemes overseas, in countries including China, Russia, India, South Korea and Thailand.<br/>At Cardiff-based Tempo Time Credits, its time-sharing model is a bit different. Instead of participants earning credits that they can redeem from someone else doing a job for them, they get credits that they can redeem at affiliated businesses, such as local gyms, cinemas, food shops and tourist attractions.<br/>Rachel Gegeshidze, chief executive of Tempo Time Credits, says its online-based system is a way of attracting and rewarding volunteers. It is used by local authorities across the UK to help develop projects aimed at key community improvements, such as addressing loneliness or tackling poverty.<br/>\"It really supports people to do new things and try new experiences... but also, we have programmes to engage tenants in their communities and to improve health and wellbeing,\" she says.<br/>The charity's 2022 Impact Report showed that there were 10,731 active participants and about 1,100 involved organisations. The study also found that 84% of people taking part felt more positive about their future.<br/>Back at TimeRepublik, it says it doesn't wish to be seen as a replacement for cash economies, and that instead it was \"built to coexist\" with them.<br/>Cherish Cullison says that from her experience \"everyone has been very happy about the exchanges and I've met some really interesting people\".<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Now they are experimenting with nets that can protect against insects.<br/>The mesh size of insect-proof nets is determined by the local conditions, including the nature of the insects.<br/>Of course that could shut out the insects that farmers really do want - pollinators like bees. <br/>One option is to apply the nets after the pollination period. Another is to open the nets during the day, while bringing in beehives.<br/>Tree nets are particularly well established in French and Italian apple orchards, where nets draped over rows of apple trees limit the movements and egg laying of codling moths. This has helped farmers to get rid of persistent pests and reduce their use of costly and environmentally damaging chemical pesticides. <br/>There are benefits to fruit lovers as well. \"When you know that you have less pesticide residues from crops that are under exclusion nets, it's good news for consumers,\" says Prof Aoun.<br/>Nets are also seen as a way of tackling the effects of climate change. Warmer conditions have seen the resurgence of some types of insects and diseases. <br/>Some regions are seeing more intense periods of drought and heavy rain and nets can help with that.<br/>For instance, depending on the location, the type of net, and the way it is used, a netting system can shield against the solar radiation that leads to heat stress and inhibits trees' photosynthesis. <br/>But the introduction of a net could mean a more humid environment around the tree - not helpful for crops prone to fungal diseases in wetter climates like the northeastern US and Canada.<br/>But some researchers are working on hydrophobic nets, where a treatment using a botanical pesticide essentially makes the nets water repellent.<br/>Photoselective (coloured) nets can also affect the penetration of light. Dark, opaque nets reduce light intensity but not light quality.<br/>Pearl-coloured nets can scatter light better so that it reaches more parts of the vegetation. Meanwhile, blue, red and yellow nets filter certain solar wavelengths and thus can stimulate specific responses in plants related to fruit quality.<br/>Fine-tuning the net usage often leads to an increase in high-calibre fruit, according to Prof Aoun. As her research in the Mediterranean has shown, trees covered by coloured shade nets can produce larger and more vividly coloured fruit.<br/>Nets are not always the answer. They may not be appropriate for smaller, more varied orchards. Nor are they necessary for all climate conditions. <br/>Also, the nets used for fruit trees are typically made of polyethylene, which isn't ideal for a world attempting to move away from plastic dependence. <br/>More technology of business:<br/>One of the companies working on non-plastic nets is Texinov, a French technical textiles firm. Texinov is researching various types of biodegradable nets, such as ones made from flax. <br/>It has already introduced a biodegradable net made out of polylactic acid (PLA), which is produced from fermented corn. Industrial composting is needed to break down this type of net, which sales manager Adrien Etienne says is about 10% more expensive than a conventional net.<br/>Mr Etienne says that the biodegradable nets are currently more popular in Europe than in North America. This may be linked to European policies intended to reduce insecticide use. \"The nets, I think, will become more and more popular because insecticides are less popular,\" Mr Etienne says, for instance among French cherry farmers. <br/>The upfront cost has been a barrier for some farmers. \"Nets are of course a little bit expensive compared to insecticides,\" Mr Etienne acknowledges. <br/>Texinov's cheapest net sells for around \u20ac0.50 (44p) per square metre for private use in France, according to Mr Etienne. This type of net lasts for only one or two seasons, although the heavy climate protection nets can last much longer. Durability depends on factors like solar exposure. \"The nets are more and more fragile because of the sun,\" says Mr Etienne.<br/>Overall, Prof Aoun says that prices are dropping as products become more varied and accessible. \"In general the positive impact of the net is overwhelming the negative side,\" she summarises.<br/>Jean-Marc Rochon heads the apple tree nursery P\u00e9pini\u00e8re Rochon in Quebec and is keeping an eye on advances in netting.<br/>\"In my eyes, this technology is more in the development and improvement phase rather than in large-scale application,\" he says. <br/>For Mr Rochon to begin using nets on his apple trees, the cost of the netting wouldn't be the only factor. \"I see it more as a way of rethinking our ways of doing things,\" he explains. <br/>To be viable for his nursery, the netting would have to be reliable and not create a work overload. It would also need to be useable on large orchard sections.<br/>Clearly, technological refinements and communication will be necessary to convince more fruit growers that netting would be useful. <br/>But Prof Aoun believes, \"As we move toward more climatic challenges and unpredictable weather, protective cultivation using nets is the way forward.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

We feel like pioneers in this.\"<br/>The rechargeable ring, called the HB Ring, is made by Czech firm The Touch. Although the first iteration went on limited sale back in 2016, the company is now seeing an increase in global interest thanks to the wider surge in the smart ring sector.<br/>In addition, the business has this year launched a new parallel product - The Touch Locket. To be worn on a necklace, this has the same technology as the smart rings.<br/>Its target customers include engaged couples who might like the idea of being able to feel their loved one's heartbeat, but don't want to forgo having traditional wedding rings.<br/>Jiri and Ondrej are among the many couples now increasingly using tech in their wedding celebrations. From drones for wedding photography, to digital tools to help with wedding planning tasks, such as managing the budget and seating arrangements, tech has infiltrated many important aspects of the wedding day.<br/>The wedding tech trend is growing as a result of people conducting so much of their lives on their smartphones, says Zoe Burke, the lead editor for UK wedding planning website Hitched.co.uk.<br/>\"I think people just take it for granted now that you'll be able to plan your wedding through your phone. You probably met your partner through your phone,\" she says.<br/>A third of couples in the UK are now said to use WhatsApp to invite guests to their wedding, and 60% announce their engagement on social media.<br/>New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.<br/>Some people are even now using artificial intelligence (AI) software to write their wedding vows or speeches. US-based wedding planning website Joy recently launched an AI tool that can do all this for you.<br/>Called \"Wedding Writer's Block Assistant\", it is based on ChatGPT, the chatbot founded by the San Francisco-based tech firm OpenAI.<br/>Vishal Joshi, co-founder and chief executive at Joy, says that rather than killing off the romance involved in writing vows or speeches, the aim of the AI tool is to make life easier for people who have difficulty putting their feelings into words.<br/>\"We did a survey, and found 89% of respondents find it overwhelming to start writing their wedding material,\" says Mr Joshi. \"The AI tool is not supposed to replace human emotions, but for many people it's helpful.\"<br/>The global coronavirus pandemic helped pave the way for tech-based weddings, with couples that didn't postpone their nuptials getting married over Zoom or livestreaming their ceremony to guests at home.<br/>But virtual weddings now suffer from their association with Covid-19 restrictions, according to Ms Burke. \"People have moved away from livestreaming weddings. They don't want to be reminded of that time,\" she says.<br/>For couples dealing with spiralling costs brought about by higher inflation, utilising tech can save money, such as sending out e-invitations instead of posting out paper ones. This also has an environmental benefit.<br/>Rohita Pabla, a wedding planner based in London, says: \"It's about cost saving and being environmentally conscious. More and more couples are thinking about the environment.\" <br/>Making an impact on social media during the big day is also, perhaps unsurprisingly, now a huge focus for many, with couples and guests posting videos on TikTok or Instagram during the wedding and the following reception. <br/>One new development in this direction is the growing trend of hiring \"gif booths\" for the reception. These are photobooths that take short bursts of photos to create gifs, or moving images. The user then simply enters his or her mobile number, and the gif is immediately sent to their phone.<br/>\"Some [couples] want the pictures to get picked up and shared over multiple different platforms,\" adds Ms Pabla. \"They want to be the Instagram couple.\" <br/>But couples also need to cater for their less tech savvy wedding guests, or those who prefer to get their invitations the traditional way. Ms Pabla, who specialises in planning South Asian weddings, says that many couples she works with ensure they observe certain traditions alongside using tech-based solutions.<br/>For example, in traditional Indian weddings, it's customary for the bride and groom to give family members and older guests a physical wedding invitation in person.<br/>\"So the couple will get a few copies of invitations made and those will be for parents and grandparents,\" says Ms Pabla. \"But for their peers the same age they'll just send them a digital invite.\"<br/>Mr Joshi adds that wedding tech can be used to \"make everything easier and much more interesting\". Yet he cautions that at the same time you need to avoid the risk \"of losing the charm and the romance of what real weddings are about, which is essentially bringing friends and family close together\".<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Age is the highest risk factor for disease, whether it's cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, or dementia, so if ageing as a whole could be delayed, then so could the risk of onset of these conditions. For him though, it's a sport.<br/>In Mr Johnson's luxurious Venice Beach home, a bedroom has been converted into a clinic where he spends many hours.<br/>He wakes at 5am, eating his first meal an hour later, followed by a second, and final one at 11am. This, combined with a forensically selected 54 pills, a mix of supplements and off-label medication, are all planned based on readings from a catalogue of tests.<br/>His days consist of a torturous exercise regime, monitoring and numerous treatments.<br/>He told me the all-over skin laser treatment he's been having has reduced his skin age by 22 years, the greatest age reduction in any part of his body.<br/>The aesthetics are just a small part of it all though, as he reminds me \"our skin is our biggest organ\". <br/>Mr Johnson was warm, logical and likeable. I left his house wanting to be (a bit) like him. Maybe I am already - I run 5km a day, try to avoid sugar, and test extreme tracking devices for fun.<br/>My colleagues considered Mr Johnson's existence joyless, so his life is clearly not for everyone.<br/>While his routine might seem extreme, every conversation I had still came back to lifestyle.<br/>\"Lifestyle is responsible for about 93% of your longevity - only about 7% is genetics,\" says Eric Verdin, chief executive of The Buck Institute for Ageing Research.<br/>\"Based on the data [if we live healthily], I would predict that most people could live to 95 in good health. So there's 15 to 17 [extra] years of healthy life that is up for grabs for all of us,\" he told me.<br/>The big question, which Mr Verdin and others are investigating, is what does a healthy lifestyle mean? Take exercise for example - should that be a daily stroll, or a HIIT class? <br/>The same goes for healthy eating. Is fasting as important as avoiding sugar? And what about a good night's sleep?<br/>You can't underestimate the obsession with sleep I came across. I met many people setting their alarms not to wake up in the morning, but to remind them to go to bed on time for a full eight hours.<br/>Well, we all set the bar at different levels.<br/>Mr Verdin practises what he preaches, his regime consisting of \"a whole lot of exercise, some fasting, good sleep, lots of social connections, very little alcohol\".<br/>His suggestion for others? \"Try to spend at least 14 hours of your 24 hours without ingesting any calories as this has a profound effect on your metabolism.\"<br/>The jury is out on how healthy this is for some women though.<br/>Keeping better track of our bodies as they age might help. Health risks could be flagged in advance and any new drugs could be applied just at the right time. <br/>Make it personalised, make it pre-emptive, make it better is the mantra.<br/>It was interesting to see that pretty much all of those working in longevity science wear more than one tracker themselves - commonly a smartwatch and a smart ring (way more convenient for sleep I can tell you - and these people are obsessed with prioritising sleep).<br/>More technology of business:<br/>For my part I've found health tracking illuminating. I am not diabetic, but have been fascinated by the findings of a continuous glucose monitor I wore for a while. <br/>The assumption is progress on longevity will come, albeit in a less sensational form than some may be hoping for.<br/>Experts suggest that a drug might emerge that will initially make a year or two's difference, then a few years more with the next generation, and so on.<br/>But along with such progress will come practical and ethical dilemmas.<br/>One fundamental question is whether ageing can be defined as a disease. This might simplify the approval of drugs by regulators, but risks labelling people over a certain age \"diseased\".<br/>The cost of such treatments may or may not (for developed medical systems anyway) be an issue, depending on what it turns out to be.<br/>Meanwhile, a healthier life is likely to lead to a few extra years of existence, so we may need to work longer.<br/>On my longevity learning mission, my expectations were upturned.<br/>I'd seen the sensationalist headlines, suggesting tech billionaires lounging on their yachts, deliberating over whether they fancied saving the world, going to space, or \"curing\" ageing.<br/>This wasn't the reality I saw. The wealthy have been giving money to medical research for years. This is just a new generation of wealth, and a potential new specialism of medicine. <br/>Plus it's really interesting, and affects us all.<br/>But right now, extending your healthspan involves hard work. As Silicon Valley-based journalist Danny Fortson put it: \"Exercise is hard, magic pills are easy, so that's why everyone is so excited about the pill.\"<br/>So I returned home feeling more determined than ever to live my healthiest life - sleep better, exercise without excuse, eat well, cherish social connections (yes, this was on the longevity prescription).<br/>With a bit of luck that might buy me enough time to benefit from any scientific breakthroughs.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

while 118 Tories voted in favour. <br/>No vote was recorded for 225 MPs, because they either abstained or did not turn up to vote. <br/>Mr Johnson had asked his supporters not to vote against the report, with sources close to the former prime minister arguing it had no practical effect now he has resigned. <br/>But his critics suggested the move was designed to avoid revealing the low level of support for him among Tory MPs. <br/>Some abstained, while others did not turn up to vote at all. <br/>Johnson allies who spoke in the debate but did not vote include Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg and Lia Nici. <br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak did not attend the debate and has refused to say how he would have voted, suggesting he did not want to influence others. <br/>Senior Conservative Tobias Ellwood, who voted to back the report, said it was a \"highly symbolic\" day as Parliament sought to \"bring to a conclusion a very difficult chapter in British politics\". <br/>He said that because Mr Johnson had already \"walked\", many MPs, including him, had not initially appreciated the wider public's high expectations for Parliament to not just rubber stamp this report but thoroughly debate its findings, given it related to rules set by the government.<br/>\"This was the collective conscience of Parliament, if you like, being judged by the British people,\" he said.<br/>The Liberal Democrats accused Mr Sunak of \"a cowardly cop-out\". <br/>The party's deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"His failure to vote says all you need to know about this prime minister's lack of leadership.\"<br/>A Labour Party spokesperson said Mr Sunak was \"too weak to lead a party too divided to govern\". <br/>The vote means Mr Johnson loses his right to a parliamentary pass, which gives access to certain parts of Parliament, as this was one of the report's recommendations. <br/>The Privileges Committee of MPs, which has a Conservative majority, was asked to investigate whether Mr Johnson had misled MPs over what he knew about parties held in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns - dubbed the Partygate scandal. <br/>Its report concluded that Mr Johnson made multiple deliberately misleading statements to Parliament about events at No 10. <br/>Ahead of the report's publication, Mr Johnson announced he was quitting as an MP, branding the committee a \"kangaroo court\". <br/>The report found Mr Johnson had committed further \"contempts\" of Parliament by attacking the committee, increasing the severity of the recommended sanction. <br/>The committee subsequently recommended a 90-day suspension for Mr Johnson - a long ban by recent standards - as well as denying him the parliamentary pass, which he would normally be entitled to as a former MP. <br/>If he had still been an MP, the suspension could have triggered a by-election in his constituency. <br/>Speaking during a Commons debate ahead of the vote, Mrs May said backing the report would be \"a small but important step in restoring people's trust\" in Parliament.<br/>It was \"important to show the public that there is not one rule for them and another for us\", she said. <br/>Mrs May urged her fellow MPs to vote in support of the report \"to uphold standards in public life, to show that we all recognise the responsibility we have to the people we serve, and to help to restore faith in our parliamentary democracy\". <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rishi Sunak is asked several times if he will take part in Boris Johnson Partygate report debate and vote in the Commons.<br/>During the debate, supporters of Mr Johnson spoke out against the report's findings. <br/>Ms Nici, who was Mr Johnson's parliamentary private secretary, told MPs she could not see any evidence he had knowingly misled Parliament. <br/>She questioned the impartiality of the committee and suggested the process was \"political opportunism\" for people who did not like Mr Johnson. <br/>Former minister Sir Jacob, who was knighted by Mr Johnson in his resignation honours, described the proposed 90-day suspension as \"a vindictive sanction\". <br/>In response to accusations some Johnson allies had attempted to discredit the committee's work, Mr Rees-Mogg said it was \"absolutely legitimate to criticise the conduct of a committee\" and its members. <br/>However, the committee's chairwoman, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said its members had to \"withstand a campaign of threats, intimidation, and harassment designed to challenge the legitimacy of the inquiry\". <br/>She defended her impartiality, after Sir Jacob referenced her previous tweets criticising Mr Johnson, saying she had offered to step aside as chairwoman after the tweets emerged but she said she was assured by the government she should continue in her role. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Harriet Harman answers Jacob Rees-Mogg who raises her \"famous tweets\" about Boris Johnson<br/>Earlier it was not clear whether there would be a formal vote on the report - compelling MPs to go on the record to either vote for, against or abstain - but Labour forced one. <br/>It was a free vote for Tory MPs, meaning party managers - known as whips - had not instructed them how to vote. <br/>Commons Leader Ms Mordaunt, who opened the debate, said she would vote in support of the report, adding: \"The integrity of our institutions matter.\"<br/>However, she said \"all members need to make up their own minds and others should leave them alone to do so\". <br/>Sunak not expected to attend Partygate debate<br/>Tory MPs face dilemma on Johnson Partygate vote<br/>Boris Johnson Partygate report at a glance<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

That is likely to include the controversial new Rosebank development west of Shetland.<br/>Sir Keir said: \"Labour will deliver lower bills, good jobs, and energy security for Scotland and the whole UK, as Britain leads the world in the fight against climate change.\"<br/>He said it would be a \"historic mistake\" to wait until North Sea oil and gas runs out and let the opportunities \"pass us by\".<br/>The Labour leader said his party had \"a credible plan to manage the change, protect good jobs and create good jobs. No cliff edges.\"<br/>One of Labour's initiatives will be to provide more incentives for areas to take part in new clean energy projects. Under Labour's plans, GB Energy - the new publicly-owned firm which it says will be based in Scotland at a location yet to be decided - would play a key role in getting that message across.<br/>It would oversee the return of profits from successful projects to local councils. The councils could then use that income to reduce council tax, pay for improved public services or simply provide rebates on energy bills.<br/>Labour says GB Energy could end up providing up to \u00a3600m per year to local councils to invest in green infrastructure and a further \u00a3400m annually in low interest loans for community projects.<br/>These community loans would be designed to ensure small projects could benefit from the expertise of GB Energy while also generating money for local areas.<br/>Sir Keir accused the Conservatives and the SNP of having abysmal records on renewables.<br/>He said Labour would introduce new rules on \"good work, decent pay and union recognition\" - and create a new incentive.<br/>This would be \"a British jobs bonus that will attract new investment, new jobs, new supply chains into our deprived industrial heartlands and will reward companies that back working people\".<br/>Offshore Energy UK's chief executive David Whitehouse told the BBC that Labour's plans to move away from the reliance of North Sea oil and gas \"would create a cliff edge\" deterring investment and heightening the risk of energy shortages.<br/>Mr Whitehouse said 180 of the North Sea's 283 active oil and gas fields were due to close by 2030, and new licences were \"essential\" or production would \"plummet\" and \"the UK and its skilled workforce will be exposed\".<br/>The GMB union said the UK was going to need oil and gas until 2050 and beyond, and that a ban on new licences \"ignores this reality\".<br/>But Philip Evans, of Greenpeace UK, said the idea that the plans would \"lead to an overnight shutdown of the industry\" was nonsense.<br/>Labour's opposition to new exploration licences represented \"genuine leadership\" he added, and the party was right \"to debunk scare stories being peddled by climate delayers\".<br/>Mike Childs, head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, welcomed Labour's latest ideas but warned \"there can be no backsliding on pledges to stop new oil and gas extraction and invest in green growth\".<br/>Environmental groups are particularly vocal about their opposition to the proposed Rosebank development in the North Atlantic.<br/>Industry and government sources say the field could be approved by the UK government's North Sea Transition Authority within weeks.<br/>Norwegian state-controlled oil company Equinor said Rosebank could produce almost 70,000 barrels of oil a day at its peak.<br/>Sir Keir has held private talks with senior energy industry figures in the past week and previously gave direct assurances to Equinor that a Labour government would not revoke any licences.<br/>Instead the party says its focus is on delivering \"cheaper zero carbon power by 2030\" and its \"mission\" includes plans to attract and incentivise investment \"in the UK's industrial heartlands\".<br/>That is likely to provoke comparisons with the approach taken by the US Democratic president Joe Biden whose Inflation Reduction Act has been described by the UK Conservative government's Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch as \"protectionist\". <br/>The Scottish Conservatives' energy spokesman Liam Kerr described Labour's plans as \"ruinous\" for the UK's oil and gas industry, claiming they \"would throw up to 90,000 highly skilled workers in the North East under a bus pretty much overnight\".<br/>The Scottish government said it was committed to \"a planned and fair transition\" away from fossil fuels that did not imperil jobs.<br/>First Minister Humza Yousaf said Labour governments had squandered hundreds of billions of pounds of oil and gas revenues, and only invested a fraction in Scotland.<br/>\"I am not sure anybody will trust a Labour Party on the green economy just two weeks after they dump their \u00a328bn green prosperity fund,\" he added.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

To embed rights we should all enjoy in a modern constitution.\"<br/>Mr Yousaf set out how the Scottish Parliament would legislate for an interim constitution after a vote to leave the UK - with this coming into force when Scotland becomes independent.<br/>A constitutional convention would then be established to develop a draft constitution, which would be considered by Holyrood.<br/>The first minister said it would only come into force if the people of Scotland backed it in a referendum.<br/>The SNP leader said his party's preferred route to independence was a legally binding referendum - something the UK government has repeatedly refused to countenance. <br/>He said building a consensus among Scottish voters was the way to break the \"logjam\" over Scotland's future and said he aimed to use the \"power of people\".<br/>The party's strategy will be discussed at an SNP independence convention on 24 June. <br/>Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that his government was focused on the cost of living crisis, the NHS, and growing the economy, but that these issues are \"linked\" to plans for an independent Scotland. <br/>\"We've had over a decade of Westminster-imposed austerity. We have a hard Brexit also being imposed upon Scotland, of course a Brexit we did not vote for, doing untold damage to our economy and to our businesses too,\" he said. <br/>\"So independence gives us the opportunity to take our own future very much into our own hands.\"<br/>A UK Government spokesperson said: \"We want to work constructively with the Scottish government to tackle our shared challenges because that is what families and businesses in Scotland expect.<br/>\"This is not the time to be talking about distracting constitutional change.\"<br/>Scottish Conservative constitution spokesperson Donald Cameron said the plan was \"full of holes\". <br/>\"People want the SNP-Green government to be focused on their real priorities right now such as rising bills, fixing our NHS and strengthening our economy,\" he said. <br/>Scottish Labour constitution spokesperson Neil Bibby said the \"SNP resort to pipe-dreams as the country crumbles under their watch\". <br/>And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton accused the SNP of being \"completely out of touch\".<br/>He added: \"Deploying more civil servants, money and time into independence is an insult to everyone waiting for help with the cost of living crisis, on lifeline ferries or for critical operations and treatments.\"<br/>Sturgeon unveils case for Scottish independence<br/>Sturgeon: I am certain I have done nothing wrong<br/>At a glance: Scottish government independence paper<br/>Five questions on the economics of independence<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

That's why I also back the police in tackling this blight in communities which are disproportionately affected, such as among young black males. We need to do everything in our power to crack down on this violence.\"<br/>The Home Office called on officers to use available powers to arrest people who unlawfully obstruct stop-and-searches. It said forces should publish footage from body cameras worn by officers quickly to prevent innocent officers from being \"subject to trial by social media\".<br/>The Home Office also said it was planning to put into law two conditions for using stop-and-search powers. <br/>The department said police should communicate with \"the local community\" when putting in place Section 60 orders - that is, stop-and-searches that can be carried out without requiring \"reasonable grounds\".<br/>Police forces can authorise the use of Section 60 orders in set areas - usually a neighbourhood or sometimes a whole borough - for a defined period of time.<br/>The Home Office also said data on every stop-and-search interaction must continue to be collected for it to publish for transparency and public scrutiny.<br/>The National Police Chief's Council described stop and search as a \"valuable policing tool\".<br/>Dorset Police Chief Constable Amanda Pearson said: \"We know that the use of stop-and-search can have a significant impact on individuals and communities, particularly our black communities and young people. <br/>\"It is our responsibility as leaders to ensure that we balance tackling crime with building trust and confidence in our communities.\"<br/>But former Metropolitan Police Ch Supt Dal Babu said Ms Braverman's attempt to direct officers on stop-and-search was a \"very troubling\" intervention, and it should be down to local commanders to decide when it is used.  <br/>Emmanuelle Andrews, policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said the home secretary's push was going to do \"immense harm to our communities\".<br/>The policing watchdog has previously called for an end to the overuse of stop-and-searches on people from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds.<br/>In 2022, the Independent Office for Police Conduct said it was a \"legitimate policing tactic\", but it was time to \"break the cycle\" of its disproportionate use, which was causing \"trauma\" and damaging confidence in policing.<br/>Police must end stop-and-search trauma \u2013 watchdog<br/>What is a Section 60 stop and search?<br/>Police forces to trial new stop and search order<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

That led to his suspension from the Conservative Party in April last year. <br/>He announced his resignation in an interview with the Mail On Sunday in which the paper reports him as admitting to taking cocaine after drinking \"incredibly potent\" Japanese whisky. <br/>He added in the interview: \"I was set up, but I have been naive and incredibly stupid.\" He went on to deny the harassment claims he is accused of. <br/>His immediate departure means the Conservatives will now face a fourth by-election.<br/>Mr Warburton has represented his constituency as an independent since losing the Tory whip. A writ for a new election is usually issued with three months of the resignation, according to Parliament's website. <br/>Mr Warburton, who had taken the constituency from the Liberal Democrats in 2015, was re-elected in 2017 and 2019. He won with a majority of 19,213 in that last poll.<br/>\"My constituents in Somerton and Frome who elected me three times with overwhelming majorities have for a year been deprived of the voice they need,\" said Mr Warburton.<br/>\"I am so grateful for their many messages of support, and it is with sorrow that I have no choice but to provoke the upheaval of a by-election.\"<br/>He also said in his three-page resignation letter  he had been denied a fair hearing by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) and prevented from \"speaking out\" while it investigated the accusations.<br/>The House of Commons rejected the claim saying ICGS was \"there to ensure all complaints are dealt with in a manner that is fair, thorough, independent and efficient\". <br/>In a statement, a Commons spokesman said: \"We remain committed to ensuring that lasting cultural change can be delivered for all of those in Parliament.\"<br/>Mr Warburton joins Boris Johnson and Nigel Adams who resigned last week triggering by-elections in their constituencies. <br/>Nadine Dorries also announced her resignation, but said her departure would not be immediate as she wanted to stay while she seeks to investigate how she was denied a seat in the Lords on Boris Johnson's resignation honours list. <br/>Labour's national campaign co-ordinator Shabana Mahmood accused Prime Minister Rishi Sunak of being \"too weak to act himself\" after Mr Warburton resigned \"in disgrace\". <br/>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Time after time the Conservatives have mired themselves in sleaze and scandal neglecting the issues that really matter to people.

Perhaps not Boris Johnson.  <br/>\"He loves oxygen and he doesn't care about Parliament. Everyone is talking about him and he'll be delighted,\" suggests a former ally who knows him well.  <br/>And his remaining die-hard backers claim the verdict of the privileges committee, which investigated whether he deliberately misled Parliament over lockdown parties at No 10, is a vindictive strike against a politician loved by party members and much of the public. <br/>Is that true? <br/>When it comes to the public, the polls have suggested for many months that claim is tripe - to use Boris Johnson's terminology for the report into his conduct. <br/>He did have an unusual ability to connect with voters. But he long ago fell out of favour with the public. <br/>And what about inside the Conservative Party, that is again indulging in what seems like its favourite hobby, arguing with itself? <br/>I've been talking to activists and MPs from around the country to test that out. Like in any big organisation there are differing views, but repeatedly, different sources describe three distinct groups.<br/>One experienced party member describes the different tribes as Boris Johnson's \"super fans, never fans, and only fans while he was an asset\". <br/>The reference to the Only Fans website - known for its adult content - may be a mischievous hint that perhaps there was a transactional element all along. <br/>The super fans<br/>This is the group for whom Boris Johnson is a political rock star.<br/>Former cabinet minister Nadine Dorries has made her views plain - warning that Conservatives who endorse the privileges committee's findings could be chucked out of their seats. <br/>Another former cabinet minister told me there was such unhappiness the party might even split over how Mr Johnson has been treated. <br/>A different senior backer told me their colleagues were totally underestimating the anger among members and Mr Johnson's magic ability to win, warning that \"people are making a terrible mistake\" which could undermine democracy. <br/>The never fans<br/>The howls of rage from the super fans are matched by massive sighs of relief from the \"never fans\".<br/>One former president of the Conservative National Convention, the top brass of the voluntary party, told me: \"I am so relieved he is gone - and really gone. Boris was never suited to the top job.\" <br/>One Scottish activist said: \"For goodness sake man, just go. If you really care about our party and our country then go quickly and quietly. You made your bed and you were caught lying in it.\"<br/>Even if members do still have affection for Mr Johnson, this activist argues they \"aren't who we need to appeal to\" to win elections, saying the super fans are \"delusional idiots\". <br/>Only fans<br/>The biggest group by far however is those who were content to back Boris Johnson for as long as he was useful. <br/>This is summed up by one activist who backed him as PM: \"It was a transaction. At the time I absolutely realised and knew what his flaws were. <br/>\"But I took the view that you have to decide what is the bigger issue and it was keeping Corbyn out.\"<br/>Another association chair in south-east England said his members absolutely do not want Mr Johnson back, apart from a few die-hards, telling me: \"It's like when someone has had a really exciting but disastrous boyfriend, afterwards, you have a pang occasionally and you miss the excitement but you don't really want them back.\"<br/>An activist in the Midlands who once backed him said: \"Everyone liked him to start with and were willing to take a punt. He has smashed his credibility and his likeability.\" <br/>One MP, in a constituency with one of the highest Brexit Leave votes, told me: \"Practically nobody has got in contact. He's so popular he appears to have rendered my constituents incapable of using their fingers to tap out an email or pick up a phone - it's been staggering.<br/>\"It's like all those X Factor winners, one of their songs comes on and you think, 'oh yeah people actually used to love that'. Then you think 'but why?'.\"<br/>Not so much the rock star any more. <br/>It is impossible to be scientific about the size of each group, but in each of my conversations it is clear the super fans are very definitely a minority. <br/>One source calculates \"you have gone from 70% being supportive of him to only around 20%\", adding: \"The sensible middle ground of members has definitely gone away.\"<br/>Another party chair says only \"10% of the grassroots are pro - who would actually want him back\". There is a desire to move on, not just from the political melodrama, but also the era that Boris Johnson defined.<br/>As one activist says: \"What we need is Boris Johnson to go away. And most people want Covid and Brexit to go away. He represents both of those.\"<br/>A regular peep at the Telegraph letters page would suggest its readers gave up on him months ago. If Boris Johnson is no longer tickling the tummies of the party's most traditional media backer then the notion he's still the Tory darling just does not hold. <br/>There still is the possibility of a vote on the report into his conduct in the Commons on Monday. <br/>Having promised to uphold integrity and accountability it is tricky for the prime minister to sit it out, but that does seem the most likely outcome. One minister joked: \"He is likely to be many miles away.\"<br/>And it's worth noting that Boris Johnson's camp has backed away from turning the vote into another bout of a fight it has already lost. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>His remaining supporters are not going to vote against the committee's findings, which would have been a way of protesting against what they saw as its vicious judgement. <br/>It seems, realising the support might have looked embarrassingly paltry - maybe \"20 votes on a good day\" as one minister said - they now won't turn up at all. <br/>There is evidence of some campaigning to make the vote count at the margins. Tory website the Conservative Post is encouraging MPs to vote against the report, along with circulating some wild claims that the committee ignored the rule of law. <br/>Separately, the Liberal Democrats have been making hay in local media, demanding their Conservative rivals vote to endorse the verdict that Johnson lied. If they don't, you can imagine they'll use that to try and embarrass their opponents. <br/>But neither Labour nor the Lib Dems are at the moment planning to force a vote to endorse the report. It may therefore go through \"on the nod\", where MPs do not have to vote, sparing Tory blushes. <br/>There is a small irony in MPs not even bothering to vote on the departure of the most prominent politician of his generation. Alternatively, it tells you all you need to know. <br/>But however messy his exit, the end of the Johnson era is prompting questions about what he leaves behind. <br/>Rishi Sunak is yet to sketch out a bold, new canvas. His brand - and it very much is a brand - is designed to create an impression of quiet competence rather than create fireworks. <br/>The risk - or maybe the reality - is that's created a sense of quiet drift. <br/>One of the activists I spoke to said this \"is the beginning of whatever will be the story after the election\" - assuming Rishi Sunak will lose - and \"it is going to be brutal and nasty - you can see the various wings in the party already beginning to manoeuvre themselves\".<br/>One of the other members just wants the Conservatives to concentrate on what the public needs: \"I just feel what people want to talk about on the doors is health and the cost of living.\" <br/>As the pressures of rising mortgage costs in particular become horrifyingly clear, the Conservative Party - already well behind in the polls - can ill-afford another week like this.<br/>It is not clear yet how much trouble Boris Johnson wants to cause. Will he use his new newspaper column to sledge Rishi Sunak at every opportunity? Or actually, as he did yesterday, confine himself to writing about battles with his weight?! <br/>That seems vanishingly unlikely. Whatever he chooses to do there is a sense that the Conservative Party is exhausted by it all. Years of drama. Years of fighting. Years of its majority being spent on arguments with each other. <br/>One of the activists I spoke to warned of a spreading sentiment: \"More than half the grassroots are just disillusioned - too apathetic to campaign, too apathetic to vote, some talking about spoiling ballot papers.\"<br/>Whether super fans, never fans, or only fans, Conservatives have to deal with the legacy of Boris Johnson. <br/>But after all the drama, all the political pain and adrenalin mixed in, they may have to confront the horror of apathy too. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

That's \u00a3378 per month more, or nearly \u00a323,000 more over the five-year term.<br/>Mr Gove acknowledged people moving off fixed-rate deals faced \"significant increases\" along with broader cost-of-living pressures. <br/>But he said the best way to tackle this was to bring down inflation.<br/>A Treasury source added that a bailout for homeowners would be \"self-defeating\" because it would push up inflation and prompt the Bank of England to further raise interest rates.<br/>The Sunday Times reported that the Treasury has ruled out mortgage support for this and other reasons. Instead, it will ask banks to do more to stop people losing their homes.<br/>David Husbands, 43, a property valuer from Chester-le-Street in County Durham, said his rising mortgage payments were \"crippling\" him.<br/>His payments have gone from about \u00a3300 per month in early 2022 to more than \u00a3600.<br/>\"Because interest rates have gone sky high I'm lucky if I'm left with \u00a3100 to live off at the end of each month,\" he said. \"I've had to take on extra casual work elsewhere.\"<br/>He is finding the situation \"exhausting\" and \"very stressful\", finishing work at 5:30pm, then doing gigs as a casual DJ until midnight.<br/>He fell into negative equity during the financial crash of 2008, and doesn't have enough money to renovate the house to sell it to \"at least break even\".<br/>David and his husband have also put adoption plans on hold.<br/>\"Right now we don't feel confident to be able to give a child a secure, safe and comfortable home,\" he said.<br/>The idea of the government providing help for mortgage customers is more nuanced than the furlough jobs scheme or recent Energy Price Guarantee.<br/>While those were universal, less than 30% of UK households have a mortgage.<br/>Providing support for them risks alienating older voters who own their homes outright, and younger people who cannot even afford to buy.<br/>That is why the government is not entirely ruling out some kind of support for homeowners, but sticking to its key pledge to bring inflation down to below 5%.<br/>In theory that would ease everyday costs for every household.<br/>However, ministers are desperate to get the economy firing, and if millions of people soon have to pay hundreds of pounds a month extra in their mortgage costs, that is money which they won't spend on eating out, buying goods or holidaying.<br/>With a growing number of mortgage customers now getting into arrears, and repossessions increasing sharply in recent months, it is a worrying time for millions of households, with no easy answers.<br/>Read more here<br/>Will soaring mortgage costs push the UK into recession?<br/>Remortgaging costs to go up average of \u00a32,900<br/>Average two-year mortgage rate close to 6%<br/>Five reasons why mortgages are getting us down<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Both Ms Gray and Labour have said they will abide by Acoba's recommendations. <br/>The committee has no powers to enforce its recommendations or to punish MPs - or former MPs - who have broken the rules, but it can issue public rebukes. <br/>Earlier, an Acoba spokeswoman told the BBC \"newspaper columns are not considered significantly problematic\", but Mr Johnson was still meant to seek its advice. <br/>Mr Johnson's first column details his experience with the anti-obesity medication Ozempic, which he used to try and control his weight.<br/>\"It's a cinch, said the doctor,\" he wrote. \"All you need to do is inject a tiny dose of clear Ozempic fluid into your abdomen, once a week, and hey presto \u2014 no more raiding the fridge at 11.30pm for the cheddar and chorizo washed down with half a bottle of wine.\"<br/>While the ex-PM hoped he was \"going to become an ex-glutton\" and \"start to resemble chiselled whippet\", things \"started to go wrong\" after a month of injections, which he puts down to \"constantly flying around the world and changing time zones\". <br/>\"For now I am back to exercise and willpower,\" he added. <br/>The Daily Mail Online Twitter account described Mr Johnson as \"one of the wittiest and most original writers in the business\". <br/>In a video shared by the paper, he said: \"I am thrilled to have been asked to contribute a column to the Daily Mail.<br/>\"It is going to be completely unexpurgated stuff.<br/>\"I may even have to cover politics, but I'll obviously try to do that as little as possible unless I absolutely have to.\"<br/>In his opening column, the former prime minister made good on that promise, steering clear of politics and the events of the past week altogether. <br/>Instead, he wrote of his experience trying a weight-loss drug which, he said, worked \"miraculously\" for one of his cabinet ministers, but not for him.<br/>\"I was going to search for the hero inside myself - the one that was three stone lighter. I was going to locate that svelte and dynamic version of Johnson, imprisoned for decades in pointless extra body weight, and I was going to set him free,\" wrote the former MP.<br/>He said he had to give up injecting the fluid into his stomach once a week \"because they were making me feel ill\", but still believed such drugs could be \"transformative\".  <br/>Mr Johnson has declared millions of pounds in earnings outside Parliament since leaving No 10 last September, most of it from making speeches. <br/>In February, the total was nearing \u00a35m.   <br/>Now that he has stood down as an MP, he will not have to declare his earnings in the register of members' interests.<br/>The committee previously found Mr Johnson broke the rules by taking up a \u00a3275,000 a year column with the Telegraph weeks after standing down as foreign secretary.<br/>It said it was \"unacceptable\" Mr Johnson had not sought its advice before signing the contract.<br/>His Telegraph column became an important platform for his opposition to then-Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans, and for building support for his own leadership ambitions. He stopped writing it when he entered Downing Street in July 2019. <br/>His new role with the Mail could give him the chance to take public pot shots at Rishi Sunak, with whom he has recently clashed over his resignation honours list. <br/>Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Mail titles, was rumoured to have been nominated for a peerage by Mr Johnson, but was reportedly one of the names removed during the House of Lords vetting process. <br/>Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has asked his supporters not to vote against a report that found he deliberately misled Parliament over Partygate. <br/>Several of his allies, including Nadine Dorries, had said they would oppose the Privileges Committee's findings in a Commons vote on Monday.<br/>Its main recommendation is that Mr Johnson should be suspended from Parliament for 90 days, but he has already resigned as an MP.<br/>Johnson's Telegraph contract broke rules<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

This ended in March 2023.<br/>A separate Energy Bill Relief Scheme was targeted at businesses. <br/>The PAC said the schemes were introduced quickly, but the lack of understanding of customers' circumstances meant it took too long to get help to some of those most in need. <br/>Some 900,000 customers without a direct relationship to a domestic energy supplier, such as those in park homes or living on boats, had to wait until 27 February 2023 to be able to apply for the EBSS.<br/>And 836,000 households in Northern Ireland only began receiving support with their energy bills from the EBSS in January 2023, three months later than in the rest of the United Kingdom. <br/>The PAC said people were left waiting months for help due to the government's \"lack of bandwidth\" to ensure all groups, including vulnerable people, received support at the same time.<br/>The committee also highlighted \"unacceptable practices\" of suppliers forcing entry into vulnerable customers' homes to install prepayment meters.<br/>This has been banned by Ofgem for British Gas but only suspended in voluntary arrangements with other energy suppliers.<br/>The cross-party group said it had \"serious concerns\" about the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero's (DESNZ) \"lack of urgency in addressing the energy market failures that are leading to high energy bills for consumers\".<br/>The largest schemes resulted in the department providing support to some homes and businesses that did not necessarily need it.<br/>A DESNZ spokesman said the committee's report failed to recognise \"the complexities of delivering support to households without a direct relationship with a supplier\".<br/>\"It's right we made sure there was a robust system to help protect people against fraud before rolling it out,\" he added.<br/>The department said it had delivered nearly \u00a340bn in support, with 83% of energy bill support vouchers now redeemed, including people in Northern Ireland.<br/>The committee said a quarter of vouchers for two million households on prepayment meters had not been redeemed by February, the most recent figures available.<br/>Labour MP, Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the PAC, said: \"The surge in energy prices has caused serious difficulties and hardship for households across the UK. <br/>\"It is of course welcome to see government moving quickly to put in place support for both households and businesses to keep the lights on. <br/>\"But many of those who most needed help were kept waiting longest for it. For some households, every day left without support presented impossible choices.<br/>\"We need to see better understanding from government on vulnerable customers' circumstances so that help can be prioritised for those who need it most, and to deliver value for money in these extremely expensive schemes. <br/>\"Almost halfway through the year we have not yet seen plans to ensure energy affordability for the coming winter.\" <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

However, the army is still waiting for testing is to be completed.   <br/>The vehicles are being assembled mainly by General Dynamics in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales. The project is managed by Defence Equipment and Support, part of the MoD, based in Bristol. <br/>Responding to the report in a Commons statement, Mr Cartlidge said the project had \"turned the corner\" with training taking place in a range of Ajax vehicles on Salisbury Plain this week.<br/>Whether the MoD or its contractors were to blame for issues was not within the scope of the review carried out by senior lawyer Clive Sheldon KC.<br/>He found that \"optimism bias infected some of the thinking of senior individuals working on the programme. The failures that I identified were systemic and institutional.\"<br/>The report said there was a \"reticence\" to escalate concerns about the noise and vibration issues, and \"it took a considerable amount of time before anyone looked at the matter strategically and asked what was really going on\". <br/>This led to senior personnel and ministers \"being surprised to discover in late 2020 and early 2021 that the programme was at much greater risk than they had appreciated\".<br/>Conservative former defence minister Mark Francois told MPs the programme had been an \"absolute debacle\", adding that the report had revealed \"just how massively bureaucratic and broken the MoD's procurement really is\". <br/>He called for \"root-and-branch reform of how we buy military equipment\".<br/>Conservative chairman of the Commons Defence Committee Tobias Ellwood said \"something very, very serious has gone wrong\" and \"Ajax is now a case study... [of] how not to do procurement\".<br/>Labour spokesman Chris Evans described Ajax as the \"biggest procurement failure for a decade\", calling the findings \"beyond damning\" and \"embarrassing\" for the government. <br/>Ajax had become \"a byword for waste and incompetence\", he said.  <br/>Mr Cartlidge said the review would improve the MoD's understanding of the governance, culture and leadership of major programmes.<br/>But he conceded it \"makes for difficult reading\", identifying \"fragmented relationships\" and \"conflicting priorities\". <br/>\"Now, we accept these findings and most of Mr Sheldon's 24 formal recommendations, with 15 accepted and nine accepted in principle.<br/>\"Crucially, the review did not find that either ministers or Parliament were misled,\" he said. <br/>Mr Cartlidge said many of the behaviours highlighted in the report had been addressed, both in the armoured cavalry programme and across the MoD, while transparency had improved including detailed updates on the Ajax project. <br/>Armoured vehicle project back on track - Wallace<br/>Delays to armoured vehicles 'risk UK security'<br/>Payments resume for armoured vehicle project<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

To meet its objective, Mr Lodge said the government needs to process 2,200 claims a week.<br/>But if claims are refused quickly, other teams \"will have to increase their capacity\" and shoulder the costs and increase their staffing levels. <br/>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The backlog pushes costs to the wider asylum system if it isn't done intelligently.\"<br/>A Home Office spokesman said it was working \"non-stop\" to reduce the backlog and had already doubled the number of caseworkers and cut the \"legacy backlog\" by 20% - the pile of more than 100,000 unresolved asylum applications made before 28 June 2022.<br/>\"We know more must be done to bring the asylum system back into balance,\" he said.<br/>\"The Illegal Migration Bill will stop the boats by detaining those who come to the UK illegally, and swiftly returning them to their home country or a safe third country.\"<br/>The National Audit Office's report said only half of case workers are taking decisions, falling short of the Home office's target of 62%. Cuts in the \"legacy backlog\" had been achieved by slowing down decision-making on newer claims, it found, meaning a new backlog was growing there. <br/>Labour shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said the Conservatives had \"lost control\" of the backlog. <br/>\"The prime minister has admitted that the asylum system is broken,\" he said. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

As Rhun was the deputy leader in that team, what's changed?\"<br/>Rhun ap Iorwerth has represented the constituency of Ynys M\u00f4n - which covers the Island of Anglesey - since 2013.<br/>The former BBC Wales political correspondent had previously attempted to become party leader in 2018, when he was beaten by Adam Price.<br/>Before he became leader - a role that has to be performed by a Member of the Senedd - the politician had been selected to stand for the party in Ynys M\u00f4n at the next general election.<br/>It will now need to find another candidate, as the new leader confirmed he would not stand for the seat.<br/>Rhun ap Iorwerth is taking over Plaid Cymru in the absence of a public debate about the party's future and after weeks of near-radio silence from his colleagues.<br/>He becomes leader with no detailed plans for what he will do - his campaign amounting to a short social media video issued a few weeks ago.<br/>And apart from a tweet here and there, there have been few big interventions from party figures. <br/>It all gives the impression of a party that did not have the appetite for the theatre of a leadership campaign, given everything that has happened.<br/>The task facing Rhun ap Iorwerth is enormous. Plaid remains vexed by the question of how to break out of its heartlands in north and west Wales.<br/>To ever have a chance of unseating Labour in Wales it has to win seats in urban Wales, where Plaid struggles. <br/>But with the party's internal problems out in the open, the hard politics of the ballot box are taking a backseat.<br/>What we know about Plaid Cymru's new leader<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Parliament over lockdown parties.<br/>The top lawyers defending Mr Johnson were paid for with taxpayer funds.<br/>Labour says Prime Minister Rishi Sunak should demand Mr Johnson \"pays back every penny\" of public money used to fund his legal defence.<br/>The government has sought to justify the decision by claiming there is a precedent for supporting former ministers with legal representation.<br/>But the government has not been able to name a single example of a former minister receiving taxpayer-funded legal support for a parliamentary inquiry.<br/>Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said Conservative ministers had \"utterly failed\" to produce evidence to back up their assertion that funding Mr Johnson's legal defence followed convention.<br/>\"This murky arrangement that has seen the public left to pick up the tab for Boris Johnson's Partygate legal bills is not only without precedent but without justification,\" Ms Rayner said.<br/>The Liberal Democrats have urged Mr Sunak to \"do the decent thing and force Johnson to pay the bill himself\".<br/>\"It's frankly unbelievable that hardworking taxpayers are being left to foot the bill for Boris Johnson's shameful antics,\" the party's Cabinet Office spokesperson, Christine Jardine, said.<br/>The SNP's leader in Westminster, Stephen Flynn, said: \"The legal costs, which the public have paid for, need to be recouped from Mr Johnson.\"<br/>Mr Johnson's spokesperson referred to the government's response, explaining there is a long-standing position on legal support, justified by precedent.<br/>The inquiry by the Privileges Committee was launched last April, after opposition parties accused Mr Johnson of misleading MPs about gatherings in government buildings during Covid-19 lockdowns.<br/>In an unprecedented decision, the committee found Mr Johnson had committed repeated contempts of Parliament with his Partygate denials.<br/>In its conclusions, the committee said criticisms of the inquiry in opinions submitted by Mr Johnson's legal advisers were \"without merit\".<br/>Mr Johnson said the inquiry amounted to a \"political assassination\", and branded the committee's findings \"deranged\".<br/>The Cabinet Office made the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs for the inquiry last year, when he was still prime minister.<br/>The BBC has spoken to two former ministers who were investigated by MPs for misleading Parliament and were not given legal support.<br/>The former Labour MP and transport secretary, Stephen Byers, was not offered legal support when he faced a four-month inquiry in 2005.<br/>Nor was the former Labour MP and paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson, who was found to have \"inadvertently\" misled MPs in 2001.<br/>In a response to a parliamentary question this week, Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin defended the decision to pay Mr Johnson's legal costs.<br/>He said the principle \"can also be applied to parliamentary inquiries, where it relates to one's conduct as minister of the Crown\".<br/>But Mr Quin provided no examples of former ministers having their legal bills covered for parliamentary inquiries.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>The MP who submitted the question, Labour's Karl Turner, said that the Cabinet Office had \"created a precedent\" with the decision to fund Mr Johnson's legal defence.<br/>This meant there was now a two-tier system whereby ministers and former ministers receive legal support to fight parliamentary inquiries, and backbench MPs do not, he added.<br/>\"We cannot have a system that unfairly advantages one member as against another member, in terms of having their excessively large legal bills covered by the taxpayer,\" Mr Turner said.<br/>\"Mr Johnson is a multi-millionaire if he wants to instruct the country's leading public lawyers and solicitors then let him pay for it.\"<br/>Last month, the contract to hire Mr Johnson's legal team was extended for the third time and increased in value, from \u00a3222,000 to \u00a3245,000.<br/>The Treasury did not sign off the decision to use public money to pay the bill, but has insisted its approval was not required for all spending decisions.<br/>The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, has been examining

The Speaker of the House of Commons then issues a warrant to the clerk of the crown, who then sends the writ to the returning officer in the constituency.<br/>A by-election would then be triggered in the rural constituency, which includes the small towns of Ampthill, Flitwick, Shefford and Woburn. <br/>Mid Beds has been a Conservative seat since 1931, with Ms Dorries doubling her majority in the four elections she has fought and won since first being elected in 2005.<br/>Campaigning has already started, even though at this point it could be regarded as a phoney war, with some of the big guns from the main three parties already visiting.<br/>The Conservatives have sent Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden to Flitwick, and party co-chairman Greg Hands was in Mid Beds the day after her announcement.<br/>Despite the lack of formal resignation from the sitting MP, the party has named its new candidate as Festus Akinbusoye, who has been the Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner since his election in 2021.<br/>Allow Twitter content?<br/>This article contains content provided by Twitter.

or whether to abstain.<br/>The motion - which would see Mr Johnson stripped of his right to a parliament pass - is likely to pass comfortably.<br/>The committee's main recommendation is that Mr Johnson should be suspended from Parliament for 90 days, but he has already stood down as an MP. <br/>The report, which was published on Thursday morning, said the former PM had deliberately misled Parliament over lockdown parties and had committed repeated offences with his denials. <br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - who was Mr Johnson's chancellor - has not said whether he will vote on the report.<br/>Johnson loyalists - including former ministers Sir Simon Clarke, Nadine Dorries and Sir Jake Berry - have said they will vote against the report's findings.<br/>It is likely that many more Conservative MPs could abstain, or simply not turn up to the vote, while Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are all expected to support the committee's findings.<br/>But Conservative MPs still face a dilemma over Monday's vote.<br/>Voting against the recommendations risks alienating local party activists who want Mr Johnson gone, voting for it risks angering his fans, who believe he has been hounded out of Parliament.<br/>Allies of Mr Johnson warned Tory MPs they could face battles with their local parties to remain as candidates at the next election if they back the motion.<br/>Senior Conservative MP Damian Green told the BBC that \"deliberately abstaining is not really rising to the importance of the occasion\".<br/>The former cabinet minister under Theresa May said he intended to vote to approve the report with a \"heavy heart\".<br/>Sir Jake - an ally of Mr Johnson - said he was \"almost certain that Parliament will vote in favour\" of the report on Monday.<br/>But Sir Jake said he would \"certainly be one of those in the no lobby opposing this report, whose conclusions he called \"wrong\".<br/>So far, 15 Conservatives have publicly criticised the committee:<br/>Liberal Democrats say the report \"speaks for itself\" and should be approved without a debate.<br/>Sir Ed Davey criticised the amount of time the government is spending debating Mr Johnson's conduct, and said the Conservative party is operating \"in absolute chaos\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>Following a year-long investigation, the seven-person Privileges Committee found Mr Johnson had had \"personal knowledge\" of Covid-rule breaches in Downing Street but had repeatedly failed to \"pro-actively investigate\" the facts. <br/>The committee said officials had not advised Mr Johnson that social distancing guidelines were followed at all times, contrary to what he said in the House of Commons at the time. <br/>In key evidence, Martin Reynolds - one of Mr Johnson's most senior officials - said he had advised the PM against making the claim, questioning whether it was \"realistic\".<br/>Mr Johnson announced last Friday that he was standing down as an MP with immediate effect after being shown a draft of the report.<br/>A by-election will be held on 20 July in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.<br/>In an eviscerating statement he branded the committee a \"kangaroo court\" and its findings \"deranged\", accusing Harriet Harman, the Labour chairwoman of the committee, of bias.<br/>The committee said the initial proposed sanction was increased \"in light of Mr Johnson's conduct\" in recent days - including breaching confidentiality rules and \"being complicit in the campaign of abuse and attempted intimidation of the committee\".<br/>Mr Johnson's statement was \"completely unacceptable\", they said.<br/>Responding to the report, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson had \"disgraced himself\", and the Liberal Democrats' Daisy Cooper said he had treated Parliament with \"total disdain\".

Following their recent reunion, he said: \"It was as wonderful an experience this time as it was 50 years ago. I shall miss her.\"<br/>Other tributes were paid from across the worlds of the arts and politics.<br/>Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who now sits in Jackson's former seat, tweeted: \"Devastated to hear that my predecessor Glenda Jackson has died.<br/>\"A formidable politician, an amazing actress and a very supportive mentor to me. Hampstead and Kilburn will miss you Glenda.\"<br/>Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell, who worked for Jackson before becoming an MP herself, recalled the \"incredibly kind\" politician's \"cutting humour\" and \"general disdain at most things\".<br/>\"She was the definition of an icon, successfully spanning the world of acting and politics with great aplomb,\" Powell wrote.<br/>Broadcaster and former Conservative MP Gyles Brandreth said she was \"a wonderful actress, a committed politician [and] a remarkable human being\".<br/>\"We became MPs on the same day in 1992 & I treasure our unlikely friendship,\" he wrote. \"She was such a gifted, caring & special person who came into the world to make a difference - and did.\"<br/>A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said it was \"extremely sad news\", adding: \"His thoughts will be with her friends and family at this time.\"<br/>TV presenter Carol Vorderman said: \"To see this unique woman turn into a firebrand in politics was deeply impressive for young girls like me. May she rest in peace.\"<br/>Jackson began acting after joining an amateur dramatics group as a teen while working in Boots near her tome town of Birkenhead in Merseyside.<br/>She won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (Rada) in London, and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1963.<br/>After making her name on stage, she won her first Oscar for playing a headstrong artist in director Ken Russell's film of DH Lawrence's novel Women in Love.<br/>Her second Academy Award came three years later for A Touch of Class, a romantic comedy in which she played a fashion designer caught up in a catastrophic love affair with a US businessman. <br/>She did not attend either ceremony, though, saying she was busy.<br/>\"All awards are very nice to have,\" she told BBC Radio 4's This Cultural Life last year. \"But they don't make you any better.\"<br/>The role in A Touch of Class came about after she famously showed off her comedy skills in a guest appearance as Cleopatra on Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise's hit Saturday night TV show.<br/>\"I've always said, and I mean it, they were the apotheosis of my career, working with them,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs.<br/>She also played the Egyptian queen - more seriously - on stage in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra for the RSC.<br/>Sir Jonathan, who was also in that production, told BBC Radio Wales: \"Everyone will talk about her tremendous strength and courage and intelligence, [and] her wit.<br/>\"I worked with her twice in the 70s, and she was always direct, always honest. And, like the greatest art, her work was simple and uncluttered.\"<br/>In its tribute, the RSC described her as \"a tour de force in acting and politics, dedicating her life to both\".<br/>The company added: \"We're proud her extraordinary talent was seen on RSC stages early in her career in ground-breaking productions.\"<br/>Jackson played Elizabeth I in BBC drama Elizabeth R - another role she famously revisited - winning Emmys for both Elizabeth R and also playing the queen opposite Dame Vanessa Redgrave in 1971 film Mary, Queen of Scots.<br/>Further Oscar nominations came her way for portraying a frustrated office worker in a love triangle in 1971's Sunday Bloody Sunday, and for taking the title role in 1975's Hedda, adapted from Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler.<br/>Labour MP Chris Bryant, who wrote a biography of Jackson in 1999, told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: \"She had such versatility.<br/>\"It's the quality of the work, and the variety. Her voice could go to gravel to caramel in three seconds.\"<br/>Former Labour MP Baroness Hoey told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"When she came into Parliament, she was so modest. She never wanted to be reminded that she was an actress.\"<br/>Other credits included playing English poet Stevie Smith in Stevie, and as Hollywood icon Patricia Neal in The Patricia Neal Story.<br/>A staunch Labour supporter, she was approached to stand for Parliament - and said she agreed because she disliked former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the \"destruction that her policies has had on human beings\".<br/>There was a link between acting and politics, she said.<br/>\"The best theatre is about trying to find and tell the truth,\" she told Desert Island Discs. \"It's not about covering up. It's not about playing games. It's not about hiding. It's not about pretending you're something you're not.<br/>\"It's trying to find what it is to be a human being and why we behave towards each other in the ways that we do.

Consequently, they will buy fewer things which should slow the rate of rising prices.<br/>An increase in interest rates means higher monthly mortgage, credit card and loan payments for some people. But higher rates should benefit savers - if banks pass them on to their customers. <br/>Asked if he was following former chancellor John Major's dictum in 1989 that \"if it isn't hurting, it isn't working\", Mr Hunt said: \"In the end there is no alternative to bringing down inflation, if we want to see consumers spending, if we want to see businesses investing, if we want to see long-term growth and prosperity.\"<br/>The government has no say over interest rates since the Bank of England was granted independence in 1997.<br/>The UK economy expanded in April after shrinking by 0.3% in the previous month. For the three months to April, it grew marginally by 0.1%. <br/>The ONS said strong trade in bars and pubs boosted growth, but added the construction sector had faltered as rising interest rates and mortgage costs made house buyers more cautious.<br/>As interest rates have risen and more people are coming to the end of fixed-rate mortgage deals, some lenders have been withdrawing certain mortgages from the market. <br/>First-time buyers are being met with higher rates, leaving some priced out, and renters are also facing higher costs due to landlords selling up.<br/>On Wednesday afternoon, HSBC, a major UK mortgage lender, temporarily withdrew new residential mortgages supplied through brokers.<br/>\"Over recent days cost of funds has increased and, like other banks, we have had to reflect that in our mortgage rates,\" an HSBC spokesperson said.<br/>Hiking rates is meant to persuade consumers to spend less - as their cost of borrowing rises or rates on savings accounts increase - giving businesses less scope to raise prices. <br/>But that mechanism may have become less effective over time.<br/>Take mortgages. In the early 2000s, more than seven out of 10 residential mortgages were on variable or tracker rates, immediately impacted by rate hikes. Today, it's 15% of homeowners. Even adding in the 1.8 million who are re-mortgaging this year, means it's still, contrary to a couple of decades ago, the minority of mortgage holders who will be affected. <br/>The impact of rate hikes is less widespread and may be taking longer to filter through.<br/>Equally, banks and building societies have been particularly reluctant to pass on rate hikes to savers this time, as the Bank of England and outraged customers have noted. This may in part reflect savings institutions rebuilding margins after a period of ultra-low interest rates - but gives customers less of an incentive to stash spare cash. <br/>Higher interest rates also should mean businesses have less scope to give workers inflation-matching pay rises than in the past - but a shortage of workers makes this less likely this time. <br/>Even if, as some economists fear, interest rate rises are less effective this time, they remain the main tool for fighting inflation.<br/>Ian Burns, who runs Cameron Homes, a housebuilder in Staffordshire, said people were being \"very cautious\" and were \"taking longer to make decisions\".<br/>\"Over the past three or four weeks, we've seen a slowdown in reservations,\" he told the BBC's Wake up to Money.<br/>\"We can't just continue to build houses if we don't have customers for them.\"<br/>Stronger-than-expected wage growth for workers in the three months to April has raised the prospect that the Bank could raise rates close to 6% by the end of the year in its bid to reduce inflation.<br/>On Monday, two-year government borrowing costs rose to levels higher than during the aftermath of last September's mini-budget. <br/>When asked if this showed his plan was not working, Mr Hunt said: \"We are in a very different situation to where we were last autumn. The IMF, the international commentators, think the British economy is on the right track.\"<br/>But the New Economics Foundation, a think tank promoting social and economic justice, said the Bank should hold off on raising rates further and wait to see the impact of its previous increases.<br/>Its economist Lukasz Krebel said that while UK wages were rising, they were still not keeping up with inflation, meaning people were poorer in real terms. <br/>He added that rising prices were mainly due to supply side issues, such as worker shortages and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sending energy prices soaring.<br/>\"The UK government and the Bank should look to address underlying weaknesses that expose the UK to such inflation shocks - notably by supporting investment in clean energy and building retrofits to reduce our reliance on volatile fossil gas,\" he said.<br/>Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figures represented \"another day in the dismal low growth record book of this Conservative government\".<br/>\"The facts remain that families are feeling worse off, facing a soaring Tory mortgage penalty and we're lagging behind on the global stage.\"<br/>Additional reporting by Raphael Sheridan<br/>How worried should we be about rising mortgage rates?<br/>Warning rising mortgage costs to hit renters<br/>Warning prices to be higher for longer as rates rise<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

However that's to overlook we will have our full cohort of decision makers later this year. They will be trained up and fully proficient.\"<br/>At the start of May, there were 1,280 Home Office staff working on asylum decision making, a big increase on a year previously, although a slight fall from the number employed at the start of 2023. <br/>The committee also heard from a senior Home Office official, Dan Hobbs, who confirmed that the proportion of asylum decision makers who leave their jobs each year stood at 28%.<br/>The government has also introduced a streamlined process for asylum claims from nationals of five countries with the highest asylum acceptance rates.<br/>Questioned by MPs, Ms Braverman also conceded conceded that women trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation could be deported under new measures to tackle illegal migration.<br/>The home secretary said women could receive protection if there was \"compelling evidence for their reasonable grounds\" or if \"they are part of a police investigation\".<br/>She was also asked by the SNP's Alison Thewliss about the disappearance of 154 asylum seeker children from temporary hotel accommodation. <br/>Ms Braverman said missing persons cases were a matter for the police, but confirmed there were no longer any unaccompanied child asylum seekers in hotels. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

or module - will examine how well prepared the UK was for Covid up to January 2020. <br/>Mr Keith said: \"Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Chair Baroness Hallett pledged that the inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic would be the \"thorough investigation\" that the public deserves.<br/>The former High Court judge paid tribute to a \"dignified vigil\" of bereaved family members holding a silent protest outside of the building. <br/>Lady Hallett said there were three key questions to be answered for the \"millions of people who have suffered and continue to suffer\": <br/>This first part of the inquiry will hear from key politicians, civil servants, scientists, unions, health and care organisations, groups representing victims and their relatives and more. <br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has criticised the inquiry's timetable and says people have been \"excluded from sharing key evidence\".<br/>They branded the inquiry's Every Story Matters project - where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK. <br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Paigon is slang for enemy. The song is explicit and listener discretion is advised.<br/>In the past, HMRC has closed its telephone line when it could not cope with demand, a public accounts committee report has said. <br/>In the past five years the number of customer service staff has reduced from 25,500 to 19,500 as HMRC has moved more customers to digital systems. <br/>A HMRC spokesperson said: \"Our online services, including the HMRC app, are quick and easy to use and have been significantly improved.\"<br/>While the helpline is closed, taxpayers will be redirected to a digital assistant and online guidance. HMRC have said this change will free up 350 advisers to take urgent calls on other lines and answer customer correspondence. <br/>Jonathan Eida, of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: \"Taxpayers will be furious to learn that HMRC's self-assessment phone will be off the hook for months this year. <br/>\"Workers trying to do the right thing require assistance all year around, and for many people going online presents a number of challenges. <br/>\"HMRC should reverse this decision and pick up the phone this summer.\"   <br/>You must fill in a self-assessment tax return if in the last tax year you were self-employed as a \"sole trader\" and earned more than \u00a31,000, if you in a business partnership or if you earned \u00a3100,000 or more. <br/>Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, chair of the Treasury committee, said: \"Given the potentially significant impact closing the self-assessment helpline may have on taxpayers, we're looking for clarification that HMRC has fully considered the costs and benefits of this decision. <br/>\"There are also concerns around the short notice with which this was announced. HMRC must be open, upfront and transparent when making decisions which could impact so many individuals.\" <br/>Ms Baldwin has written to HMRC to ask about the impact the closure will have on taxpayers and whether an analysis and consultation has taken place. <br/>She also wants to know if the helpline will be reopened earlier than planned if the negative impact on taxpayers is greater than expected. <br/>Ms Baldwin also asks if the closure of the helpline is related to HMRC's homeworking policy or staffing issues, as well as for information on the procedures in place to assist vulnerable taxpayers and those unable to use digital services. <br/>A HMRC spokesperson said: \"We continually review our services and a seasonal [self-assessment] helpline will make more of our expert advisers available to respond to the most urgent queries over the summer.\"<br/>The self-assessment helpline receives far fewer calls over the summer, with calls around 50% higher between January and April compared with June to August according to HMRC.<br/>HMRC also previously announced a decision to close its VAT registration helpline from Monday 22 May. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

A representative of the guru was also present at the event.<br/>Nithyananda fled India in 2019 while facing multiple criminal charges, including rape and sexual assault. <br/>He has since claimed to have founded a new country, known as the \"Republic of Kailaasa\", on an island off the coast of Ecuador. <br/>Nithyananda has denied the accusations against him.<br/>In December last year, Lord Ranger, a businessman who has donated tens of thousands of pounds to the Conservative Party over the past decade, told The Observer he had no knowledge of Nithyananda or his organisation.<br/>Had he known about the guru, he would not have attended the event, he told the newspaper. <br/>Standards Commissioner Akbar Khan said in his report that Lord Ranger had abused his position as a member of the House of Lords in his social media feud with Ms Joshi.<br/>\"He was acutely aware of this imbalance of power and abused it by persistently undermining, humiliating and denigrating Ms Joshi,\" said Mr Khan. <br/>\"Examples of this included his frequent disparaging remarks including 'Who is asking you? Who has given you the authority to insult others who do not appease you?

I have expressed my remorse and I apologise to Ms Joshi.<br/>\"The investigation process and reading and reflecting on the report has had a profound and lasting effect on me.

In response, Mr Johnson accused Mr Sunak of \"talking rubbish\".<br/>The resignation honours list is a tradition that gives outgoing prime ministers the opportunity to nominate people for honours.<br/>The House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC) said it rejected eight of Mr Johnson's nominations. However, there has been no confirmation of who the nominees were and why they were not included on the list.<br/>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said HOLAC did not support the peerage nominations of the MPs put forward by Mr Johnson.<br/>The spokesperson added: \"It is unprecedented for a sitting prime minister to invite HOLAC to reconsider the vetting of individual nominees on a former prime minister's resignation list.\"<br/>But Ms Dorries said Mr Sunak's team \"had made sure that certain names would not be on\" the list sent to HOLAC. Ms Dorries added she understands this \"to be true despite denials from those concerned\".<br/>Ms Dorries used her article to argue for her place in the House of Lords, writing: \"I was born into poverty and clawed my way out of it to build a new life for me and my family, and then carved out a role in public service.<br/>\"A seat in the Lords was recognition of that - and a means of continuing to give back to society.\"<br/>The prime minister's press secretary has denied Ms Dorries' version of events, saying: \"No-one in No10 amended or edited any list.\"<br/>\"As is convention, on receiving the former prime minister's resignation honours list the prime minister forwarded the peerage list unaltered to HOLAC,\" the press secretary said.<br/>Ms Dorries said Mr Johnson had told her in autumn last year she had been put on his resignation honours list.<br/>The former culture secretary said she had been vetted for the peerage, but because six months had passed, her checks had expired.<br/>She also said Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson had a meeting last week to discuss his honours list.<br/>Ms Dorries accused the prime minister of using \"weasel words\" at that meeting to give Mr Johnson the impression Mr Sunak would ask HOLAC to restart the vetting process.<br/>According to Ms Dorries, these \"duplicitous machinations\" were to avoid a by-election caused when an MP steps down to take a seat in the House of Lords.<br/>Why did Boris Johnson resign?<br/>Johnson and Sunak escalate feud over honours list<br/>The ghost of Boris Johnson haunts Rishi Sunak<br/>Country doesn't miss Johnson drama, says Shapps<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It makes a case for Parliament to start looking at this issue in detail.\"<br/>Labour MP Stella Creasy also called for urgent reform, telling BBC Two's Newsnight programme: \"I don't understand in whose interests this case was.\"<br/>Madeline Page, director of the Alliance of Pro-Life Students, described the case as a \"sad situation\" and said she would welcome a parliamentary debate.<br/>The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which opposes abortion, criticised providers for \"pushing for dangerous home abortions,\" and said women such as Foster were \"left to self-administer these drugs alone with no medical supervision or support.\"<br/>But providers say the most common side-effects of at-home abortions are \"usually easy to treat\", and \"rarely have any long-term health effects\". <br/>The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) is one of 30 campaign and health groups calling for the law to be repealed to decriminalise women seeking to end their own pregnancies.<br/>BPAS chief executive Clare Murphy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are now seeing a mother-of-three prosecuted under laws that do not exist in the same way in any other country.\"<br/>She said \"a growing number of women\" were coming under police investigation over suspected illegal abortions, with another woman facing trial later this year. <br/>A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said cases such as that of Carla Foster were \"exceptionally rare... complex and traumatic\".<br/>They added: \"Our prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions.\"<br/>Downing Street said it recognised that abortion was \"a highly emotive issue and there is a strength of feeling on all sides,\" but \"the law is clearly set out.\"<br/>\"It's up to the police and the judiciary to enforce it,\" the spokesperson added. <br/>Dame Diana Johnson, chair of the home affairs select committee, called for the government to decriminalise abortion.<br/>She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Removing the criminal law is a very sensible, reasonable step, but it's not to deregulate abortion care and who can provide it.\"<br/>The CPS argued in court that Foster had been aware of abortion limits and had provided false information during a remote medical consultation. <br/>Her defence said lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare, adding: \"This will haunt her forever.\" <br/>Foster went into labour on 11 May 2020 and the baby was confirmed dead 45 minutes later. <br/>The 44-year-old from Staffordshire had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another man's baby, the court heard.<br/>Sentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall accepted she had been \"in emotional turmoil\" as she sought to hide the pregnancy.<br/>He said she was a good mother to her three sons, one of whom has special needs, and that a suspended sentence might have been possible if there had been an earlier guilty plea.<br/>But he rejected appeals from women's health organisations to pass a non-custodial sentence, saying it was the court's duty to \"apply the law as provided by Parliament\".<br/>Ahead of Monday's hearing, a letter co-signed by a number of women's health organisations was sent to the court calling for a non-custodial sentence.<br/>The judge told the defendant the letter's authors were \"concerned that your imprisonment might deter other women from accessing telemedical abortion services and other late-gestation women from seeking medical care or from being open and honest with medical professionals\".<br/>But he said it also \"has the capacity to be seen as special pleading by those who favour wider access to abortions and is, in my judgment, just as inappropriate as it would be for a judge to receive a letter from one of the groups campaigning for more restrictive laws\".<br/>Mother jailed for taking abortion pills too late<br/>Abortion rise 'may be driven by cost of living'<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Instead, existing regulators will come up with new industry guidance.<br/>It marks a contrast with the European Union, which is set to ban public authorities using AI to classify citizens' behaviour, and bring in strict limits on AI-powered facial recognition for law enforcement in public spaces.<br/>The use of AI tools for border management would also be subject to new controls, such as being recorded in an EU-wide register.<br/>In their statement, the campaign groups said the UK's own blueprint had missed a \"vital opportunity\" to beef up safeguards on how government bodies use AI.<br/>In particular, the groups zeroed in on government algorithms often used to help officials make decisions by analysing large amounts of data.<br/>It is thought that some of these tools use machine learning - a widely-used form of AI that can train systems to improve their performance over time. Critics argue this can lead to discrimination if it is based on biased data.<br/>One such system, used by Department of Work and Pensions officials to help identify benefit claimants suspected of fraud, is currently the subject of a legal challenge over concerns it could discriminate against disabled people.<br/>The PLP, which has identified over 40 automated systems used by public bodies, has also launched its own legal action against a Home Office algorithm used to flag suspected sham marriages, which it says could discriminate on the basis of nationality.<br/>Public bodies using such systems have to comply with additional equality rules. But campaigners say it is difficult to know if these are being followed, because authorities fail to give enough information about how they work.<br/>The document sent to MPs called for public bodies to be legally obliged to inform people when AI is used to make decisions, and for the government's algorithm transparency register, currently voluntary, to be mandatory. <br/>It also demanded an \"adequately resourced\" specialist regulator to handle complaints from people adversely affected by decisions.<br/>It also expressed concern about the government's Data Protection Bill, currently going through Parliament, which would widen when legally significant decisions can be made without human oversight.<br/>The government argues current EU-derived rules, dating from 2018, are outdated and could stymie the development of beneficial AI tools.<br/>But Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at the Open Rights Group, said the bill was \"removing or watering down\" existing safeguards, depriving regulators of the tools they need \"when AI goes wrong\".<br/>The technology department, responsible for AI regulation, said the UK's approach would promote \"fairness, explainability and accountability\" in new systems.<br/>In a statement, it added that it was taking an \"adaptable\" approach to designing new rules, which recognised the \"rapid pace of development in AI capabilities\".<br/>Home Office drops 'racist' visa decision algorithm<br/>Stay ahead in AI race, tech boss urges West<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

This by convention is something peers virtually never do. <br/>She said she had thought long and hard before putting her motion, but she said: \"We threw this out and they're bringing it back in a sneaky way - and quite honestly it's breaking all the rules.\" <br/>Lord Jackson retorted that the Lords would be in danger of \"legislative over-reach\" if it believed it knew better than the elected Commons - their role was to revise legislation, not strike it down. <br/>For the opposition parties to defeat the government in the Lords, they need Labour on board, and Baroness Jones hopes they will allow their peers at least a free vote. <br/>But Labour shadow Home Office minister Lord Coaker says his party is not prepared to break the normal conventions of the Lords to defeat the changes.<br/>\"We certainly aren't going to vote to kill it. Our position is very clear. The government have brought it back in what we regard as an underhand way.<br/>\"We're going to vote against it in the Commons on Monday to lay out our position, but we're not going to fall into the elephant trap of the government using this to show us standing in the way of the democratic will of the elected government, or the elephant trap of them saying we're somehow in the pockets of Just Stop Oil.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

In evidence given in March, Mr Johnson admitted misleading Parliament, but denied doing it on purpose.<br/>The committee met on Monday and are likely to meet again on Tuesday to finalise the report. <br/>The committee had been preparing to recommend suspending Mr Johnson as an MP for 10 days or more, the BBC was told, a threshold which would have resulted in a recall petition among his constituents and a potential by-election.<br/>After receiving an advanced copy of the report on Friday, Mr Johnson shocked Westminster by announcing his resignation as the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>In his resignation letter, he vehemently attacked MPs on the committee, accusing them of trying to \"drive him out of Parliament\". <br/>He said most members of the committee, including Labour's Harriet Harman who took over from Mr Bryant as chair of the inquiry \"had already expressed deeply prejudicial remarks about my guilt before they had even seen the evidence\".<br/>On Sunday, Mr Johnson's close ally Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said the committee's report was \"clearly partisan\" and \"biased\".<br/>However, Mr Bryant issued a strong defence of the MPs telling the BBC: \"This was a committee set up by whole House of Commons, it had a Conservative majority on it and it is now being judged on the basis of a report that no one has even seen yet - absolutely appalling and preposterous.\"<br/>\"We have enough nastiness in politics without people stirring this up. People like Jacob Rees-Mogg should be utterly ashamed of themselves.\" <br/>Asked about the criticism, Rishi Sunak's spokesman said the committee was \"properly set up\" and that the government would \"in no way criticise the work of the committee who are carrying out what Parliament has asked them to do\". <br/>\"People are entitled to express opinions. What we wouldn't want to see is people unfairly traducing the work of a legitimate committee.\" <br/>Members of the Privileges Committee have been offered additional security, the BBC's Chris Mason says.<br/>Our political editor says there is widespread anger among the MPs' colleagues - from many political parties - that the tenor, tone and language of some of the criticisms of the committee, from Mr Johnson and others, has contributed to an atmosphere where committee members feel vulnerable. <br/>He says there is additional irritation that, some believe, the integrity of committee members has been impugned without them being able to respond to it publicly. <br/>In addition to reaching a conclusion on Mr Johnson, it is also expected that the report will reflect on the conduct of others in Parliament in how they have described the committee during its work, but without naming them. <br/>Mr Johnson stood down from Parliament just hours after Downing Street published his resignation honours list without the names of key supporters, including Nadine Dorries, Sir Alok Sharma and Nigel Adams.<br/>All three had been expecting to be appointed to the House of Lords.<br/>Competing claims about how and why the names were removed are now at the heart of a rift within the Tory party following the former PM's resignation.<br/>The House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC) - the official body for checking and vetting new peers - has confirmed it rejected eight of Mr Johnson's nominations on the grounds of propriety.<br/>On Monday, Mr Gove defended the decision to pass Mr Johnson's honours list to the King before the Privileges Committee report was published, insisting this was a \"separate procedure\".<br/>Within 24 hours of the list being published, both Ms Dorries and Mr Adams resigned as MPs - triggering by-elections in their constituencies, both of which are considered safe seats for the Conservatives.<br/>Mr Johnson's resignation also triggers a by-election in his marginal constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>Headlines about ex-leaders make governing tougher<br/>Country doesn't miss Johnson drama, says Shapps<br/>I've been forced out over Partygate report - Johnson<br/>Why did Boris Johnson resign?<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

But using an external agency to resolve workplace issues is not difficult. <br/>\"Neither Parliament nor the whips' offices are equipped to do it. This is highly specialised stuff.\" <br/>She said whips could remove the whip from MPs, but \"that's a political party decision\".<br/>\"The whips shouldn't be enacting sanctions as part of the complaints process. It may be considered prudent by a political party to withdraw the whip pending an investigation.\" <br/>Current MPs have also raised concerns about a lack of \"HR professionals\" to deal with cases like this. <br/>One Conservative MP said: \"Where does the buck stop? The whips, the police, the Speaker, there's also the parties. I don't see that there is any formal coming together of those.\" <br/>Parties often \"live in fear of someone saying: 'why didn't you take action?' That's where the judgement comes,\" they added.   <br/>This MP said that, while they still wanted a say in who their staff were, \"I do think there's a benefit in more HR support for MPs - I'm not an HR expert.\" <br/>They compared MPs employing their own staff with Parliament \"dealing in effect with 650 small businesses\".  <br/>Another former chief whip the BBC spoke to echoed the argument for \"external supervision\", saying the role of the whips was to \"look after their flock, not to sit in judgement of them\", and to persuade them to vote with their party the \"right\" way. <br/>On Monday, MPs will debate proposals to bar some MPs under criminal investigation for violent or sexual offences from setting foot in Parliament. <br/>The proposals have been drawn up by the House of Commons Commission, a body of senior MPs which oversees the working of the Commons, following a consultation.<br/>If approved, the plans could allow MPs or peers to be barred from the Houses of Parliament if they are deemed to pose a risk.<br/>The exclusion would apply to the parliamentary estate in Westminster and any parliamentary-funded travel.<br/>MPs are being asked to have their say on the plans, but a formal vote has yet to be arranged. <br/>The Commission has proposed that if the parliamentary authorities were presented with credible allegations of a sexual or violent offence by the police at any point in the criminal justice process, a staff panel would assess the claims.<br/>If the panel undertook a full risk assessment on the basis of information provided by the police, it would consider the nature of the alleged misconduct and whether there were any safeguarding concerns.<br/>If this led to exclusion being recommended, this would be put to an adjudication panel for a decision.<br/>Under the proposals, excluded members would get a proxy vote so their constituents were not disadvantaged.<br/>The BBC has been told there is some disagreement on the plans - with a number of MPs arguing members should not be excluded unless they are charged by police, and others arguing that the threshold for exclusion should be lower. <br/>One former chief whip said excluding people who had not been charged flew \"against natural justice\".<br/>\"Allegations can be made against members of parliament that may be false, and they may be made in a vexatious way.\" <br/>Ms Milton said she believed Parliament should be able to vote on excluding MPs from the Commons, because it was \"quite a serious issue democratically\". <br/>\"Their [MPs'] job is to hold the government to account.

legislation designed to protect people from harmful content while preserving principles of freedom of speech.<br/>Mr Scully said: \"I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude to Team Scully, the many volunteers, activists, councillors, AMs and MPs across London who supported my campaign. <br/>\"Your dedication and scale of support has been incredible.\"<br/>Mr Khan added: \"You've got a Conservative party who have stopped the Minister for London from standing to be the Conservative mayoral candidate, because they're clearly running scared of standing on the Conservative record.<br/>\"I'm going to be standing on my record next May and I'll be pointing out the Conservative record over the last 14 years.\" <br/>Ms Hall was, until last month, leader of the Conservative group on the London Assembly where she has demonstrated a combative style in scrutinising and criticising the current Labour mayor.<br/>She said that made her \"ideally placed\" to challenge Mr Khan next May.<br/>The former Harrow councillor has vowed to restore confidence in the police on issues like burglary, theft and women's safety.<br/>Ms Hall is part of a nine-strong Tory opposition group at City Hall that has been raising questions over the ultra-low emission zone (ULEZ) and pressurising the mayor to scrap its planned expansion to outer London from 29 August.<br/>Mr Korski was deputy head of policy at 10 Downing Street and a special adviser to David Cameron.<br/>He campaigned for the UK to stay in the EU and left frontline politics after the Brexit vote in 2016.<br/>He founded a technology company that provides advice on digital strategy to clients including government departments and public bodies.<br/>Finding better ways to use technology to improve the capital's public services is at the heart of his bid.<br/>He claims the ULEZ expansion is unnecessary, and it would be possible to move more quickly than the current mayor is saying to a more sophisticated road-user charging scheme - where drivers pay according to what journeys they do and at what time. <br/>The inclusion of Mr Hossain will be a surprise to many because it did not appear widely known that he had applied.<br/>He is a leading barrister and King's Counsel and has been described by the Court of Appeal as an advocate of \"great eloquence\". <br/>Mr Hossain was born in Barisal, Bangladesh, and came to the UK in 1995.<br/>In 2019, he became the first Bangladeshi-born criminal barrister to be appointed Queen's Counsel.<br/>Mr Khan's Conservative opponent in the last mayoral election in 2021, Shaun Bailey, has meanwhile been offered a peerage by former prime minister and ex-London mayor, Boris Johnson. <br/>Commenting on the news, Mr Khan joked about the 2024 election: \"What I'd say to the three candidates is, obviously I'm hoping that I win and I'm chosen, but the good news for them is anyone who loses gets a job in the House of Lords.\"<br/>In a statement on Sunday, issued as the shortlist of candidates was published, Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands MP said: \"All three of these individuals have shown great commitment to fighting Sadiq Khan and to bettering London with the Conservatives.<br/>\"I thank all of the candidates that put their name forward for this process and look forward to the hustings to come.\"<br/>Follow BBC London on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

And maybe Lord Speakers past and present will weigh in. <br/>Many peers have identified patronage in appointments to the Lords as the main reputational threat to their chamber. <br/>All this will be superimposed on an otherwise low-key parliamentary agenda - it's been getting embarrassing; last week saw the Lords sit until 04:16 on Thursday morning debating the Illegal Migration Bill, while the Commons ran out of steam on Tuesday at 14:20. <br/>Peers are debating late into the night; MPs are home in time for Hollyoaks. There may be efforts to avoid the unbearable lightness of last week's Commons business in the week ahead, but the causes remain the same - a surfeit of detailed legislation inching through the Upper House, while MPs twiddle their thumbs on the green benches of the Commons.<br/>On the committee corridor, watch out for the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman's appearance before Home Affairs on Wednesday - but as has been the recent trend, the real action is in the Lords, where peers have continued to defeat the government on a variety of issues and continue to battle the Commons over the Retained EU Law Bill.<br/>But while they regularly push back on the content of bills, Labour inhibitions about voting down secondary legislation make it highly unlikely that Green Party peer Jenny Jones's attempt to strike down an order which would give the police greater power to control or ban protest marches will have the numbers to succeed.<br/>Commons (14:30): Education Questions, with any urgent questions or government statements following.<br/>Main debate: Motion to approve a statutory instrument, the Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023. This is a highly controversial measure to rewrite what constitutes serious disruption, with the aim of giving clearer legal underpinning for the police to ban or restrict protests.<br/>That's followed by a general debate on proposed new rules for risk-based exclusion of MPs who have been accused of sexual misconduct or violent offences. This is a tough issue where the constitutional rights of MPs to attend Parliament are balanced against the safeguarding concerns of the thousands of people who work on the parliamentary estate, and many MPs are worried that the new system would make excluding them from parliament the option of first resort, as soon as there was a live accusation.<br/>The expectation had been that there would be a vote to approve proposals from the House of Commons Commission, the Commons administrative arm, but, tellingly, there will not now be a vote. The Commons Leader, Penny Morduant has, however, said she expects their will be a vote before the Summer recess. Watch out for pressure to rewrite the proposals.<br/>MPs also respond to the latest Lords amendments to the Retained EU Law Bill. This bill is now bouncing between the two Houses, and peers have pinged back new clauses requiring that EU regulations rewritten by ministers must be put before Parliament, with the possibility of debate and amendment in both Houses, and that such regulations must not reduce environmental protections and must not conflict with the UK's international agreements. Expect a few rounds more of ping pong between the Commons and the Lords.<br/>Westminster Hall: Petitions Committee debate (16:30) on two petitions taking opposite views on the legal definition of sex - the first, e-petition 623243 calls on the government to update the Equality Act to make clear the characteristic \"sex\" is biological sex and not \"sex as modified by a Gender Recognition Certificate\". This petition attracted 109,463 signatures.<br/>The second, e-petition 627984 says the government should commit to NOT amending the Equality Act's definition of sex, arguing that ministers had previously committed to not remove legal protections for trans people, an already marginalised group, but this change would do so. The petition attracted 138,886 signatures<br/>Committees: Foreign Affairs (16:00) questions Foreign Secretary James Cleverly on UK relations in the Indo-Pacific region. There will be more general questions, too.<br/>Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (16:00) holds the first evidence session of its inquiry into the finances and sustainability of the social housing sector in England, with evidence from the National Housing Federation and housing associations, plus academic experts.<br/>Lords (14:30): It's day four of committee scrutiny on the Illegal Migration Bill , with another late night in prospect. Remember, this is the preliminary phase of detailed debate - attempts to amend the bill follow at the later report stage, in July.<br/>Commons (11:30): Foreign Office Questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill in which Conservative Richard Graham proposes a measure against spiking drinks with alcohol or drugs.<br/>Main debate: MPs polish off the Procurement Bill - watch out for a joint amendment proposed by former anti-corruption Czar John Penrose and Public Accounts Committee Chair, Dame Meg Hillier, to require all government contracts to specify the policy objective they seek to meet, so future contracts can be judged by results.<br/>Westminster Hall: Conservative Richard Fuller leads a debate (14:30) on the proposed Bedford to Cambridge rail link - one facet of the wider development controversies between Oxford and Cambridge. Could be lively.<br/>Committees: Business and Trade (10:00) hear from CBI chief Rain Newton-Smith on the aftershocks of its recent scandals.   <br/>Culture Media and Sport (10:00) quiz BBC Director General Tim Davie on issues including overall performance, impartiality, commercial activities, equal pay, safeguarding and the licence fee. MPs will also discuss the internal review of former Chair Richard Sharp and the appointment process for a new chair.<br/>Education (10:00) holds a one-off session with Ofsted's Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman covering children's social care and safeguarding.<br/>Lords (14:30): Day three of report consideration of the Financial Services and Markets Bill - watch out for amendments financial products which link to deforestation, and on reviewing pension funds potential to fuel economic growth - a policy option flagged up by Labour.<br/>Then there's the ultra-contentious Draft Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023 - new regulations, which will give the police clearer powers to stop slow-walking protest marches blocking roads and bringing cities to a halt.<br/>Labour have a regret motion from Lord Coaker complaining about both the content and the process - while the Greens' Baroness Jones will propose a rare \"fatal motion\" which would kill the order. She looks unlikely to succeed, given that Labour will not support her, and without the biggest Opposition Party, the numbers don't stack up.<br/>Commons (11:30): Science Innovation and Technology questions, followed, at noon, by Prime Minister's Question Time.<br/>Ten Minute Rule Bill: Labour's Emma Lewell Buck wants to ensure families eligible for the Healthy Start Scheme, which provides help to buy food and milk for low income parents, are registered to receive it.<br/>Main debate: A half day debate on an SNP motion to be announced (they usually come up with some cunning device to ensure that the government has to actually vote against their motion, rather than ignore it). That's followed by a general debate on defence policy - including Ukraine and Nato.<br/>Westminster Hall: Labour's Rebecca Long-Baily leads a debate on insolvency law and director disqualifications (14:30).<br/>Committees: Home Affairs (09:45) questions Home Secretary Suella Braverman on issues including asylum and immigration, policing, Windrush, violence against women and girls, fraud strategy and the Passport Office. <br/>Culture Media and Sport (10:00) plunges into the Phillip Schofield controversy with ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall facing questions on the broadcaster's approach to safeguarding and complaint handling.<br/>Lords (15:00): Another long committee stage day on the Illegal Migration Bill beckons; this is supposed to be the final one. Bring a toothbrush.<br/>Commons (09:30): Culture, Media and Sport questions, followed mini question times for the MPs who represent the Church Commissioners, the House of Commons Commission, the Public Accounts Commission, the Parliamentary Restoration and Renewal Client Board, and the Electoral Commission.<br/>Finally, there's the weekly update on the forthcoming Commons agenda, from the Leader of the House.<br/>Main debate: Dame Angela Eagle and Elliot Colburn lead a backbench debate on Pride Month - this is now an annual event and will cover such subjects as conversion therapy, and the lack of a bill to ban it; hate crime and the government's review into relationship and sex education.<br/>That's followed by another backbench debate, on government policies on migration - led by Dan Carden, Sir Peter Bottomley and Tim Loughton, who say a broad debate is urgently needed to address numerous outstanding issues on migration policy.<br/>Westminster Hall: Debates on the Scottish Affairs Committee report on public broadcasting in Scotland, led by Committee Chair Pete Wishart (13:30), and then on VAT on audiobooks - Conservative Sir Mike Penning wants VAT removed on audiobooks, to bring them into line with the zero-rating of paper books. He argues that charging VAT penalises blind and partially sighted people.<br/>Committees: Public Accounts (10:00) question senior officials on the effort to get to net zero by 2050.<br/>Lords (11:00): Debate on the performance of the NHS and health service innovation; on support for freelancers in the arts and creative industries and on local government in England.<br/>The Commons is not sitting.<br/>Lords (10:00): Peers will whiz through the third reading rubber-stamping of a series of private members' bills (laws proposed by individual MPs) sent over from the Commons - the Shark Fins Bill, the Co-operatives, Mutuals and Friendly Societies Bill , the Child Support Collection (Domestic Abuse) Bill, the Offenders (Day of Release from Detention) Bill, and the Supported Housing (Regulatory Oversight) Bill.<br/>This is their final parliamentary stage and they will shortly become law.<br/>Also up for third reading - the Ofcom (Duty Regarding Prevention of Serious Self-harm and Suicide) Bill and the Coroners (Determination of Suicide) Bill. Although they will clear their Lords process, they will not be debated in the Commons.<br/>Then it's back to more private members' bills from MPs - with second reading (initial) debates on the Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill, the Powers of Attorney Bill, the Workers (Predictable Terms and Conditions) Bill and the Protection from Sex-based Harassment in Public Bill.<br/>Also up for debate, but again with no real chance of becoming law, the Public Advocate Bill (from Labour's Lord Wills).<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

In the five months to the end of May, Albanian small boat arrivals are down 90% on last year and we have returned 1,800 illegal migrants and foreign criminals back to Albania.

There is no anchor to any discernible truth or sense of integrity.\"<br/>He adds that Mr Johnson will leave Parliament and \"have little to do with the reality of the mess he left behind\".<br/>Elsewhere in the Sunday Mirror, Sir Keir accused Mr Sunak of failing to stand up to Mr Johnson and agreeing \"to hand gongs to a cast list of cronies\".<br/>\"Rishi Sunak must finally find a backbone, call an election, and let the public have their say on 13 years of Tory failure,\" he added.<br/>A government source rejected that and said Mr Sunak was focussed on delivering \"what the British people want.\"<br/>I've been forced out over Partygate report - Johnson<br/>Third by-election for Tories as Johnson ally quits<br/>Boris Johnson - facts, farce, four tragedies and the future<br/>Briton and Pakistani pair among five on missing Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Why have we junked measures to help people into housing or to scrap EU directives or to promote animal welfare?\"<br/>It was a direct aim at Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - hours after he stepped off a plane from Washington where Mr Sunak was not talking about a free trade agreement with the US. <br/>And Mr Johnson's statement was an attempt to rally Brexiteers in his party, suggesting his demise was driven by a motivation to \"reverse the 2016 referendum result\".<br/>The statement contained further criticism of former senior civil servant Sue Gray, who investigated lockdown gatherings at Number 10. <br/>\"I am afraid I no longer believe that it is any coincidence\" that she will soon become \"chief of staff designate\" of the Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer, Mr Johnson wrote.<br/>Ending his 1,000-word letter, Mr Johnson said he was \"very sad to be leaving Parliament\" before adding - \"at least for now\" - for anyone thinking he is about to retreat into obscurity. <br/>Mr Johnson's exit will trigger a by-election in his west London seat, which he held with a 7,000 vote majority in the 2019 election. <br/>The Conservatives will also have to defend the Mid Bedfordshire seat of Nadine Dorries - a close ally of Mr Johnson - after she stepped down as an MP earlier on Friday.<br/>Mr Johnson's dramatic move came after he was given the committee's findings, including details of criticisms it intended to make and evidence to support its conclusion. <br/>He had faced a potential by-election if MPs recommended a suspension from the Commons as a punishment for misleading Parliament. <br/>Responding to his statement, a Privileges Committee spokesperson said: \"The committee has followed the procedures and the mandate of the House at all times and will continue to do so.<br/>\"Mr Johnson has departed from the processes of the House and has impugned the integrity of the House by his statement.

I take my responsibilities seriously. I did not lie, and I believe that in their hearts, the Committee know it.\u00a0But they have wilfully chosen to ignore the truth, because from the outset, their purpose has not been to discover the truth, or genuinely to understand what was in my mind when I spoke in the Commons.\u00a0<br/>Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\u00a0This is the very definition of a kangaroo court.\u00a0<br/>Most members of the Committee - especially the chair - had already expressed deeply prejudicial remarks about my guilt before they had even seen the evidence. They should have recused themselves.\u00a0<br/>In retrospect, it was na\u00efve and trusting of me to think that these proceedings could be remotely useful or fair. But I was determined to believe in the system, and in justice, and to vindicate what I knew to be the truth. <br/>It was the same faith in the impartiality of our systems that led me to commission Sue Gray. It is clear that my faith has been misplaced.\u00a0Of course, it suits the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to do whatever they can to remove me from Parliament.\u00a0 <br/>Sadly, as we saw in July last year, there are currently some Tory MPs who share that view.\u00a0I am not alone in thinking that there is a witch hunt under way, to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result.\u00a0<br/>My removal is the necessary first step, and I believe there has been a concerted attempt to bring it about.\u00a0I am afraid I no longer believe that it is any coincidence that Sue Gray - who investigated gatherings in Number 10 - is now the chief of staff designate of the Labour leader.\u00a0<br/>Nor do I believe that it is any coincidence that her supposedly impartial chief counsel, Daniel Stilitz KC, turned out to be a strong Labour supporter who repeatedly tweeted personal\u00a0attacks on me and the government.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>When I left office last year, the government was only a handful of points behind in the polls.\u00a0That gap has now massively widened.\u00a0<br/>Just a few years after winning the biggest majority in almost half a century, that majority is now clearly at risk.\u00a0<br/>Our party needs urgently to recapture its sense of momentum and its belief in what this country can do.\u00a0<br/>We need to show how we are making the most of Brexit and we need in the next months to be setting out a pro-growth and pro-investment agenda. We need to cut business and personal taxes - and not just as pre-election gimmicks - rather than endlessly putting them up.\u00a0<br/>We must not be afraid to be a properly Conservative government.\u00a0<br/>Why have we so passively abandoned the prospect of a Free Trade Deal with the US? Why have we junked measures to help people into housing or to scrap EU directives or to promote animal welfare?\u00a0<br/>We need to deliver on the 2019 manifesto, which was endorsed by 14 million people.\u00a0We should remember that more than 17 million voted for Brexit.\u00a0<br/>I am now being forced out of Parliament by a tiny handful of people, with no evidence to back up their assertions, and without the approval even of Conservative party members, let alone the wider electorate. <br/>I believe that a dangerous and unsettling precedent is being set.\u00a0<br/>The Conservative Party\u00a0has the time to recover its mojo and its ambition and to win the next election.\u00a0I had looked forward to providing enthusiastic support as a backbench MP. Harriet Harman's committee has set out to make that objective completely untenable. <br/>The Committee's report is riddled with inaccuracies and reeks of prejudice, but under their absurd and unjust process, I have no formal ability to challenge anything they say.\u00a0<br/>The Privileges Committee is there to protect the privileges of Parliament. That is a very important job. They should not be using their powers - which have only been very recently designed - to mount what is plainly a political hit job on someone they oppose.\u00a0<br/>It is in no one's interest, however, that the process the Committee has launched should continue for a single day further.\u00a0<br/>So I have today written to my Association in Uxbridge and South Ruislip to say that I am stepping down forthwith\u00a0and triggering an immediate by-election.\u00a0<br/>I am very sorry to leave my wonderful constituency.\u00a0It has been a huge honour to serve them, both as Mayor and MP. <br/>But I am proud that after what is cumulatively a 15-year stint, I have helped to deliver, among other things, a vast new railway in the Elizabeth Line and full funding for a wonderful new state of the art hospital for Hillingdon, where enabling works have already begun.\u00a0<br/>I also remain hugely proud of all that we achieved in my time in office as\u00a0prime minister: getting Brexit done, winning the biggest majority for 40 years and delivering the fastest vaccine roll out of any major European country, as well as leading global support for Ukraine.\u00a0<br/>It is very sad to be leaving Parliament - at least for now - but above all, I am bewildered and appalled that I can be forced out, anti-democratically, by a committee chaired and managed, by Harriet Harman, with such egregious bias.<br/>I've been forced out over Partygate report - Johnson<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

But there will now be one in Mr Johnson's own constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip.<br/>Former Conservative minister Nadine Dorries was not put forward for the House of Lords, despite speculation she would be on the published list.<br/>Ms Dorries - who served as culture secretary under Mr Johnson - stood down as an MP \"with immediate effect\" just over an hour before the honours list was released.<br/>The resignation honours list is a tradition that gives outgoing prime ministers the opportunity to nominate people for honours. <br/>The long-awaited list, approved nine months after Mr Johnson resigned as prime minister, included 38 honours and seven peerages. <br/>Kulveer Singh Ranger, a former director of transport while Mr Johnson was London mayor, and former Downing Street chief of staff Dan Rosenfield are also among those who will enter the Lords.<br/>Charlotte Owen, a former adviser to Mr Johnson, will become one of the youngest peers, as will fellow advisers Ben Gascoigne and Ross Kempsell.<br/>Honours were handed out to some of Mr Johnson's closest advisers during his premiership, including former directors of communications Jack Doyle and Guto Harri, who were both made CBEs.<br/>Also among recipients were aides who served with Mr Johnson during the scandal over lockdown parties in Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>Martin Reynolds, Mr Johnson's former principal private secretary, was awarded the Order of Bath.<br/>In May 2020, Mr Reynolds sent an invite to a \"bring your own booze\" party to Downing Street staff when the nation was under lockdown.<br/>Ben Elliot, the former co-chair of the Conservative Party, has also been awarded a knighthood, as have Tory MPs Michael Fabricant and Conor Burns, two Mr Johnson loyalists.<br/>The first name on the list was Tory MP and long-standing Brexit backer Bill Cash, who has become a companion of honour. <br/>Membership is a special award granted to those \"who have made a major contribution to the arts, science, medicine, or government\" and it is only held by up to 65 people at any one time.<br/>Rishi Sunak has approved Mr Johnson's resignation honours list and \"forwarded it unamended\" to King Charles, the prime minister's press secretary said.<br/>\"He had no involvement or input into the approved list,\" the press secretary said.<br/>By convention, a former prime minister's resignation list of new peers is forwarded to the House of Lords Appointments Commission (HOLAC), which vets appointments.<br/>Another Tory MP who did not feature on the list, despite being widely tipped for a peerage, was Alok Sharma, who was president of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. <br/>Usually when sitting MPs are given peerages, they resign their seats, triggering by-elections.<br/>Following the Partygate scandal and the political turbulence of Mr Johnson's premiership, the former PM's honours list was always expected to be controversial and to provoke fierce criticism.<br/>Some of the reaction to the names published on Friday has met those expectations.<br/>A formerly loyal aide to Mr Johnson branded the honours list \"an utter disgrace\", telling the BBC it was \"rewards for failure all round\".<br/>They said: \"Boris has slammed the door shut on the prospect of any return to the frontline of British politics and trashed what remained of his legacy.\"<br/>Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said it was \"shameful\" that Mr Sunak had \"failed to stand up to his former boss's outrageous demands and agreed to hand out prizes to this carousel of cronies\". <br/>\"He promised integrity, but this weak prime minister is once again showing his appalling judgement by doing Boris Johnson's bidding,\" Ms Rayner said.<br/>And Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: \"Boris Johnson has been allowed to hand out gongs to his Partygate pals, and Rishi Sunak has just waved it through.\"<br/>The seven new peers on Mr Johnson's honours list will enter a House of Lords that already has more than 800 members.<br/>The Electoral Reform Society campaign group said Mr Johnson's resignation list \"demonstrates just how discredited and partisan the honours system has become\".<br/>\"It's time to end this rotten system of patronage and replace the unelected Lords with a smaller elected chamber, where the people of this country - not former prime ministers - choose who shape the laws we all live under,\" its chief executive Darren Hughes said.<br/>Boris Johnson is loyal to those who are loyal to him. And his resignation honours list underlines this - until the ink runs out.<br/>Almost all of the 45 names know him personally. Many worked for him either at No 10 or when he was London mayor.<br/>Even his current spokesman has been transformed into a legislator, with a seat in the House of Lords.<br/>And for anyone who assumed that meritocracy might play a part in the honours system, a long-standing parliamentary hairdresser, Kelly Dodge, gets a gong for doing...

But we've got to do that in a responsible way.\"<br/>However, pressed on how much investment there would be in the first year of a Labour government, Ms Reeves would not commit to a figure, arguing the economic backdrop would not be clear until closer to the time.<br/>Announcing the party's Green Prosperity Plan in 2021, Ms Reeves said the \u00a328bn would come from borrowing and would be spent on projects like offshore wind farms and developing batteries for electric vehicles. <br/>Since then the economic picture has changed considerably, with interest rates and borrowing costs soaring. <br/>Labour wants to be seen as economically credible and privately there had been concerns raised about whether the \u00a328bn of investment was affordable in the current context. <br/>There have also been complaints about how the policy has landed, with some worried the \u00a328bn figure was better known than what the money would be spent on. <br/>The Conservatives have also used the alleged dangers of the policy - that extra borrowing could increase interest rates and mortgage costs - as an attack line. <br/>However, the change in tack could make it more difficult to deliver Labour's aim of generating all electricity without using fossil fuels by 2030. <br/>Conservative Party chairman Greg Hands said Labour's main economic policy was \"in tatters\" after they realised \"it would lead to disaster\". <br/>\"It doesn't matter if they try and pretend otherwise, Labour's plan remains to stick \u00a328bn of borrowing on the government credit card which will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates,\" he said.<br/>The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said the move was \"the latest in a long line of broken promises\" from Labour, which \"could have very real and damaging consequences for Scotland's green energy potential\". <br/>Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said Labour had offered a policy which \"does not go far enough\" and then \"row[ing] back at the first sign of any difficulty\". <br/>Ms Reeves was also critical of the deal Prime Minister Rishi Sunak secured with the US on his visit to Washington this week. <br/>Plans for a full free trade agreement have been abandoned but the new proposals include allowing UK electric car firms access to US green tax credits and subsidies. <br/>Ms Reeves, who visited the US herself last month, said she was \"staggered\" that Mr Sunak had returned with \"no industrial plan for Britain\". <br/>She has said Labour is taking inspiration from US President Joe Biden's plan to tackle inflation and create jobs, which includes a huge package of subsidies and tax breaks for green industries. <br/>But she said her \"secureonomics\" strategy would be \"built on the rock of financial stability and economic security\", with strict limits on borrowing.<br/>Labour has also promised to create a publicly owned renewable energy company to create jobs and improve the country's energy security. <br/>Last week the party pledged to ban new licences for oil and gas production in the UK, despite concerns from unions this could cost jobs.<br/>Starmer vows to prevent oil communities withering<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Labour plans publicly owned renewable energy giant<br/>Labour pledges \u00a328bn a year to make economy greener<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

On the plane ride over to Washington Mr Sunak said: \"For a while now, that has not been a priority for either the US or UK.\"<br/>However, Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy criticised Mr Sunak, saying the government has left \"Britain's cupboards bare\" by not securing a trade deal. <br/>\"This statement shows the government has failed to deliver the comprehensive trade deal they promised in the 2019 manifesto, or to secure the ally status under the Inflation Reduction Act that is so important for the automotive sector and for the green transition,\" Mr Lammy said. <br/>Mr Biden said the special relationship with the UK was in \"real good shape\", referring to their co-operation on Ukraine.<br/>\"Together we are providing economic and humanitarian aid and security systems to Ukraine in their fight against a brutal invasion from Russia,\" he said.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Joe Biden calls Rishi Sunak \"president\" by mistake<br/>The Atlantic Declaration includes plans to mitigate some of the impact of the US flagship Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)  on the UK economy, with proposals to remove barriers which affected trade in electric vehicle batteries.<br/>Under current policy, the IRA provides tax credit worth $3,750 (\u00a33,000) for each electric vehicle (EV) manufactured in the US, or which use components mined, processed or manufactured in the country. <br/>The UK is already a net exporter of raw materials for EV batteries to the US. But nations without a US trade deal are barred from accessing IRA subsidies.  <br/>The Atlantic Declaration commits the UK and US to working on a new critical minerals agreement - which would give buyers of vehicles made using critical minerals processed, recycled or mined by UK companies access to tax credits.<br/>The declaration says the agreement would be launched after consultation with US Congress.<br/>Japan already has a similar deal, which allows Japanese firms to also swerve export duties on minerals used in producing EV batteries.<br/>The declaration also includes a commitment to a \"new UK-US Data Bridge\" which would allow UK firms to transfer data freely to certified US organisations without paying a levy.<br/>Downing Street estimate the change will affect around 55,000 UK businesses - translating into \u00a392.4m in direct savings per year.<br/>Mr Biden also supported Mr Sunak's plans to set up an international summit on AI safety which will be hosted in the UK later this year.<br/>The prime minister said: \"The UK and US have always pushed the boundaries of what two countries can achieve together.<br/>\"So it is natural that, when faced with the greatest transformation in our economies since the industrial revolution, we would look to each other to build a stronger economic future together.  <br/>\"The Atlantic Declaration sets a new standard for economic cooperation, propelling our economies into the future so we can protect our people, create jobs and grow our economies together.\" <br/>Both Mr Biden and Mr Sunak agreed to carry out work to improve the resilience of supply chains and efforts will be stepped up to shut Vladimir Putin's Russia out of the global civil nuclear market. <br/>US Senate passes sweeping $700bn economic package<br/>Sunak to raise trade issues in US talks with Biden<br/>Is UK being left behind in global fight for investment?<br/>Chris Mason: What Sunak is trying to achieve in the US<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

If not, the tax will  remain in place until March 2028.<br/>The level has been set at $71.40 per barrel for oil and \u00a30.54 per therm for gas. <br/>Brent crude oil was trading at $75 per barrel on Friday morning, with gas prices at around \u00a30.62.<br/>Energy firms have been urging ministers to reduce the windfall tax, warning that it was causing companies to pull back investment.<br/>In April, the UK's largest oil and gas producer Harbour said it would shed 350 UK onshore jobs as a result of the windfall tax. French oil giant TotalEnergies also said it would cut its planned 2023 North Sea investment by a quarter - \u00a3100m - because of the extension to the windfall tax.<br/>The Treasury said its decision had reflected those concerns.<br/>It said any fall in investment \"puts the long-term future of the UK's domestic supply at risk, meaning we would be forced to import more from abroad at a time when reliable and affordable energy is a focus for families and businesses\".<br/>A Labour spokesperson said: \"We need a proper windfall tax on the enormous profits of oil and gas giants to help with ease the cost of living crisis.   \"We will look at the detail of this change. Of course if the windfalls of war disappear then we'll look at what the right long-term tax position should be for the North Sea.\"<br/>Prime Minister Rishi Sunak introduced the Energy Profits Levy in May last year when he was chancellor, with the rate set at 25%.<br/>In the autumn, current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced it would increase to 35% from January 2023.<br/>The levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas, but not from other activities - such as refining oil and selling petrol and diesel on forecourts.<br/>Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea already pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that.<br/>So with the windfall tax, that takes the overall tax rate faced by oil and gas companies to 75%.<br/>If it is eliminated, the overall tax rate on energy firms would return to 40%.<br/>Trade body Offshore Energies UK welcomed the announcement, but warned the industry still faced challenges.<br/>Its chief executive David Whitehouse said: \"This is a step in the right direction, but many more will need to be taken to restore confidence to our sector.<br/>\"We will now work closely with government and lenders to understand the detail of the measure and its effectiveness at unlocking investment.\"<br/>Oil and gas giant Shell also welcomed the announcement. A spokesperson said it \"should help to improve investor confidence in the UK North Sea, which will remain crucial to maintaining Britain's energy security in the coming years\".<br/>However, the change to the windfall tax was criticised by the Green Party.<br/>\"The government seems happy to allow these huge corporations to not only wreck the climate but to profit off the back of the cost-of-living crisis which they themselves have contributed to,\" said Green co-leader Adrian Ramsay.<br/>\"Instead, the government should be tightening the tax, closing the loopholes and ensuring the money raised helps people through the cost-of-living crisis and funds the sustainable green energy jobs in the renewable sector we urgently need.\"<br/>Greenpeace UK's climate campaigner, Georgia Whitaker, said: \"Irrespective of what happens to the price of oil and gas, the tax these companies pay should be higher, permanently.<br/>\"This cash should be used to help insulate homes and transition the UK to cheap, clean energy, not fill the bank balances of already wealthy shareholders.\"<br/>How much windfall tax are oil giants paying?<br/>What is the energy cap and what's happening to bills?<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

the biggest to the party since 2001 - boosted takings, which topped all other parties.<br/>Labour raised \u00a35.8m in the same period, including \u00a3500,000 from Gary Lubner, the former boss of Autoglass.<br/>The Lib Dems received \u00a31.6m, the SNP \u00a3291,000, and the Greens \u00a3215,000.<br/>The new figures from the Electoral Commission show that UK political parties have accepted nearly \u00a321m in donations and public funds during the first quarter of 2023  - an increase of about two thirds on the same period last year.<br/>The Conservatives have reclaimed the top spot for donations, overtaking Labour, which raised the most money in the final quarter of 2022.<br/>The party has reversed a dip in donations since Rishi Sunak became Tory leader and prime minister in October last year.<br/>A Tory source said last year was \"very difficult for donations\" in the wake of Boris Johnson's premiership, but insisted the latest Electoral Commission figures showed \"a big recovery\".<br/>The source said the increase in donations was important \"because we're hiring lots of campaign managers to target the marginal seats\" ahead of the next general election.<br/>A large chunk of the \u00a312.1m in donations the party raised between January to March this year came from Mr Mansour, who was appointed Tory treasurer by Mr Sunak last year.<br/>Writing in the Telegraph newspaper, Mr Mansour said he felt reassured by Mr Sunak's leadership and revealed he had donated \u00a35m to the party's \"election fighting fund\".<br/>The Egyptian-born business tycoon, who has British citizenship, said the country had \"a very capable prime minister\" who \"understands how growth is generated in the modern economy\".<br/>\"I look at what he has achieved in his first months in office and think what he could do in five years,\" Mr Mansour wrote.<br/>Mr Mansour himself was once a politician in Egypt, where he served as a transport minister from 2006 to 2009 under Hosni Mubarak, the late Egyptian president who stood down in 2011 during the Arab Spring.<br/>Outside politics, Mr Mansour is a prominent businessman, with a fortune Forbes estimates to be $3.6bn.<br/>He is the chairman of the Mansour Group, which employs 60,000 people, and founded the London-based investment firm Man Capital.<br/>A Tory source said Mr Mansour's function as a treasurer was to \"open up networks\" and introduce the party to new contacts in the business world.<br/>Mr Mansour's \u00a35m gift was second only to Lord Sainsbury's in 2019, when he gave the Liberal Democrats \u00a38m - the biggest individual donation ever.<br/>The Conservatives received two more big donations, both valued at \u00a32m - one from Amit Lohia, a wealthy Indian industrialist, and Graham Edwards, another Conservative Party treasurer.<br/>The largest individual donations to Labour totalled \u00a3500,000 from Gary Lubner, the former chief executive of the company that owns Autoglass.<br/>Mr Lubner is expected to donate \u00a35m to the party before the next election and told the Financial Times he wanted to give Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer financial help to put the party in power \"for a long time\".<br/>Labour also received \u00a32.3m from its trade union backers, including \u00a31.1m from Unite and \u00a3359,168 from Unison.<br/>The Liberal Democrats' largest donation was \u00a3200,000, from a company called Peak Scientific Instruments, a nitrogen generator manufacturer.<br/>Tim Bale, a professor of politics and author of The Conservative Party after Brexit, said the money raised by parties ahead of general elections was important because \"it can actually make a difference to what a party can do in the campaign itself\".<br/>He said it is difficult to tell if the latest donations \"represent a vote of confidence in the current [Conservative] leadership or instead smack of panic and desperation\".<br/>The professor said there may be a \"growing fear\" of a Labour government among those who \"worry they'll lose out if that happens\".<br/>Professor Bale said, as far as some donors are concerned, the Conservative Party \"ultimately exists as an insurance policy against a social democratic government they believe will take the country in the wrong direction and, in so doing, damage their wealth\".<br/>Louise Edwards, of the Electoral Commission, said publishing the figures was vital to ensure transparency but called on the government to do more to raise confidence in the system.<br/>She said: \"We know transparency of party and campaigner finance is important for people, but our research tells us that only 24% of people believe party funding is transparent.<br/>\"It's clear that publishing this information is not enough.

The recent clampdown on protest, the new section 12 which the police used today to finally end the march\u2026 all of these are undemocratic.<br/>\"To go even further and say a walking protest is illegal - I think that's incredible.

the nature and climate emergencies\".<br/>She thanked her supporters, who she said had \"put the politics of hope above the politics of fear\".<br/>She was elected for Brighton Pavilion in 2010, becoming the first Green MP.<br/>Ms Lucas, who had two stints as Green leader, has increased her majority at every election since, winning by a margin of almost 20,000 votes in 2019.<br/>The MP's decision comes a month after her party lost control of Brighton and Hove council, despite making record gains in May's local elections in England.<br/>In an open letter, Ms Lucas said it had been the \"privilege of my life to serve this extraordinary constituency and community\".<br/>She said: \"I have always been a different kind of politician - as those who witnessed my arrest, court case and acquittal over peaceful protest at the fracking site in Balcombe nearly 10 years ago will recall.<br/>\"And the truth is, as these threats to our precious planet become ever more urgent, I have struggled to spend the time I want on these accelerating crises.<br/>\"I have therefore decided not to stand again as your MP at the next election.\"<br/>The Green Party's co-leader, Carla Denyer described Ms Lucas as a \"force of nature\" and said the party was \"so proud of her achievements\".<br/>Ms Denyer - her party's candidate for the Bristol West constituency - said Ms Lucas's record \"demonstrates how essential it is to have Green voices in UK politics\".<br/>The party's joint leader, Adrian Ramsay, said the Greens would be \"striving to get more Green MPs elected at the next general election so that we can build on Caroline's achievements\".<br/>The party won its highest ever vote share of 3.8% in 2015's general election but Ms Lucas was the only Green candidate to win a seat.<br/>Although Ms Lucas remains the only Green MP, the party has enjoyed success in recent local elections.<br/>In England's local elections in May, the Green Party won more than 240 seats and made history in Mid-Suffolk, taking control of the council for the first time.<br/>The Greens have traditionally performed best in urban areas, such as Brighton and Bristol, but the party concentrated its campaigning firepower on rural, traditional Tory areas.<br/>Labour is now expected to focus efforts on trying to win the seat after taking control of Brighton and Hove Council from the Greens in May. <br/>Labour sources point to the Greens facing anger locally over their management of the council and to their gains at the expense of the Greens in wards that map onto the parliamentary constituency.<br/>One local party source said: \"In May's local elections residents in Brighton delivered a damning and decisive verdict on the Green Party - with Labour winning nearly twice as many councillors as the Greens in Caroline Lucas' seat.<br/>\"Labour will continue to make the case to voters in Brighton Pavilion that we are the only party with the answers to the serious challenges facing the country.\"<br/>Ms Lucas's first period as Green leader was between 2008 and 2012, before her second as co-leader with Jonathan Bartley for two years from September 2016.<br/>The Brighton Pavilion MP said she came into politics \"to change things\".<br/>She said she had put a universal basic income on the political agenda, secured the first parliamentary debate in a generation on drug law reform, and been involved in the addition of a natural history GCSE to the syllabus.<br/>She told the BBC she was \"definitely not quitting\" politics, or \"retiring with my knitting\".<br/>\"I think right now, the Greens are at such as exciting stage,\" she said. \"Working to get more Greens elected is my priority.\"<br/>Ms Lucas is the latest senior MP to announce her departure from Parliament at the next election, which is expected to be held in 2024.<br/>Dozens of MPs have stated their intention leave the Commons, including former health secretary Matt Hancock, the former deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, and former SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford.<br/>Best ever local election results for Greens<br/>How UK Greens are learning from overseas allies<br/>Too late to save planet, says Green Party founder<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

But, there would be greater public oversight and higher standards. <br/>The report recognises that providers would need to be better funded - arguing that more than \u00a37bn has been spent by councils on care homes which are inadequate.<br/>While the case for more funding is set out, the report is rather shy when it comes to specific numbers.<br/>It says Labour should make a promise to increase real terms funding by a \"significant percentage each year\".<br/>\"Significant increases for adult social care are essential and inevitable,\" the report said.<br/>Insiders say that, with Labour under fire from opponents for specific spending commitments on green policies, there is a reluctance to set out specific sums in other areas well before an election.<br/>But critics are more concerned that the report has largely ducked the question of the lifetime cost of care for individuals.<br/>In a 2011 report, for the then Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, the economist Sir Andrew Dilnot recommended a cap on social care costs of between \u00a325,000-\u00a335,000.<br/>This was never implemented. But Boris Johnson's government did commit to capping lifetime care costs at \u00a386,000.<br/>However the current chancellor Jeremy Hunt delayed implementation until 2025 - pushing it until after the next general election. <br/>Labour have denounced this as \"another broken Tory promise\".<br/>But the Fabian Society report suggests a care cap should simply be \"considered\" as an option by Labour, with reform of means-testing as another possibility. <br/>It is perhaps unsurprising that some of those with knowledge of the care system are now accusing Labour of ducking the issue.<br/>Charles Tallack from the independent charity the Health Foundation said the report \"fudged crucial questions about social care costs\".<br/>\"Options for reform are well known - including building on a cap on care costs - but the missing ingredient is political will,\" he added.<br/>Streeting: I won't pretend NHS is envy of world<br/>Face-to-face GP appointments promised by Labour<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Moscow has denied responsibility, instead blaming Ukrainian shelling.<br/>Mr Sunak also said the UK should \"have confidence\" in its ability to act as a global leader in regulating artificial intelligence (AI), a topic he is set to discuss with President Biden at a White House meeting on Thursday.<br/>The prime minister is hoping to put post-Brexit UK in the driving seat of efforts to set new global rules for the emerging technology.<br/>Some experts have questioned the extent to which the UK will be able to shape new global rules outside the European Union, with the UK now shut out of key gatherings between European and American regulators such as the Tech and Trade Council.<br/>But Mr Sunak said the level of AI investment in the UK, and the quality of British research, meant it could \"shape the conversation\" on future rules.<br/>\"Other than the US, there's no other democratic country that has that strength in AI,\" he argued.<br/>Chris Mason: What Sunak is trying to achieve in the US<br/>Johnson to bypass government on Covid WhatsApps<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The history and the hallowed halls of democracy, it was very inspiring.\" <br/>Mr Paisley described Simmons as \"a real knowledgeable guy\" about the history of Parliament.<br/>\"He's got a genuine interest both in the history and the theology behind all this stuff, and he's had a private tour and he's been able to visit Deputy Prime Minister's question time,\" the North Antrim MP told the PA news agency.<br/>\"It's great to have him here, an honour to have guests here and it's great when they're passionate and interested and they can tell the world about the importance of this building and democracy and what it means for people here.\"<br/>Mr Paisley joked his guest, whose Kiss hits include Rock and Roll All Nite and Crazy Crazy Nights, would be performing a private concert for a DUP fundraiser, before adding: \"That's a lie!\".<br/>In an interview from his hotel on Wednesday evening, Gene Simmons said he had previously visited the Irish Parliament and had wanted to meet the taoiseach (Irish prime minister), but \"didn't quite get there\".<br/>\"We did tour the facility,\" he said, \"We, I mean yours truly, a few years back. <br/>\"I think it's really important for people to actually see where the people's business is being done.\"<br/>A former sixth grade teacher in New York before Kiss was formed, Simmons said he remembered teaching his pupils about Parliament and Guy Fawkes. <br/>He told Good Morning Ulster he was impressed by the \"lesson in civility\" on show in Parliament between opposing politicians, comparing it favourably to US politics.<br/>\"It's important when the occasion calls, [to] visit Parliament. I'm sure you'll be able to get in there and see some of it.\"<br/>Wednesday's visit is the second time this year that a DUP MP has celebrated a famous singer at Parliament.<br/>In March, Strangford representative Jim Shannon submitted an early day motion to mark the 50th anniversary of Dolly Parton's song 'I will always love you'. <br/>He said he noted the sentiment behind the song \"and what it means to so many\", including Mr Shannon's wife.<br/>Simmons said what politicians do \"is far more important\" than music.<br/>\"We're a diversion,\" he said. \"Our job is to make you forget about your troubles, just for those few hours that you're with us.\"<br/>Asked if he could be tempted to enter politics, Simmons said he could joke \"they don't pay enough\".<br/>\"I can literally make more in one evening doing a concert than I can being a politician for the entire year, as shocking as that may sound,\" he continued.<br/>However, he added democracy is \"our only hope\". <br/>\"If I was called to serve, sure, I would do it, but I would not accept a salary, I would do it for one dollar, tax-free of course.\"<br/>You can listen to Good Morning Ulster's interview with Gene Simmons in full here.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

the MP for Kingston upon Hull East - has written back to Mr Tierney asking for specific examples. <br/>The Labour MP told the BBC he had looked into this and believed \"there is no example the government can rely on\".<br/>He said Cabinet Office officials \"either have to give me an example when a former minister or a serving minister has been provided with legal support for a parliamentary inquiry, or they have to accept that they've set a new precedent with Boris Johnson\".<br/>Mr Turner said the government had seemingly established a two-tier system whereby ministers and former ministers \"get the protection of the taxpayer to cover their legal fees\", and backbench MPs do not.<br/>The last former minister to be investigated by a parliamentary committee for misleading Parliament was former Labour MP and transport secretary Stephen Byers in 2005.<br/>The BBC has been told Mr Byers was not offered taxpayer-funded legal representation.<br/>Last month, the contract to hire Mr Johnson's legal team was extended for the third time and increased in value, from \u00a3222,000 to \u00a3245,000.<br/>The Treasury did not sign off the decision to use public money to pay the bill, but has insisted its approval was not required for all spending decisions.<br/>The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, has been examining the decision to cover Mr Johnson's legal costs during the inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson has faced calls to pay the legal costs himself, with opposition parties highlighting he has earned millions since standing down as prime minister.<br/>The former prime minister was joined by his lawyers when he appeared in front of the Privileges Committee in March.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Key moments from Boris Johnson's Partygate grilling<br/>He denied knowingly or deliberately misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking parties in Downing Street during the pandemic.<br/>Mr Johnson has submitted answers to the committee about a number of events at Chequers and Downing Street during the pandemic.<br/>Privileges Committee sources say they are hoping to wrap up the inquiry before Parliament's summer recess in July.<br/>If the committee finds Mr Johnson in contempt of Parliament, he faces suspension as an MP, which could trigger a by-election in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency.<br/>Separate to the Privileges Committee inquiry, Mr Johnson is being provided with taxpayer-funded legal support for the public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic.<br/>Last month, Mr Johnson severed ties with the government-appointed lawyers who were set to represent him in the Covid inquiry.<br/>In a letter, reported by the Sunday Times, the Cabinet Office warned Mr Johnson that public funding for his legal representation could be withdrawn if he tried to \"undermine\" the government.<br/>A Cabinet Office spokesperson said the letter \"simply reiterates that taxpayer-funded lawyers must be used to aid the Covid Inquiry and for no other purpose\".<br/>\"This letter was intended to protect public funds.

He began a data protection action in 2021, then started a defamation claim.<br/>Ms Leslie, MP for Bristol North West from 2010-17, is the former managing director of the Conservative Middle East Council, which promotes links between MPs and the Middle East.<br/>Mr Justice Nicklin said there were \"several aspects of the conduct of the claimant\", Mr Amersi, which gave \"real cause for concern\" as to the purpose of his actions. <br/>He questioned whether Mr Amersi genuinely sought \"vindication\", which is the aim of such litigation. He also said Mr Amersi had adopted \"an exorbitant approach\" to the litigation, bringing an unnecessarily complex case.<br/>Ms Leslie said the judgment \"spoke for itself\" and she was \"delighted to have this vindication after two-and-a-half years of legal action against me\".<br/>Mr Amersi said he was \"bitterly disappointed\" and was considering an appeal. He added that he had been \"denied justice\". <br/>In a statement he said the judge's interpretation of the law \"provides effective immunity to those who publish serious falsehoods to small but influential groups of people\".<br/>David Davis MP told the House of Commons on Wednesday that the result was a \"victory for free speech\". He later described it as a \"landmark for press freedom and fair comment\".<br/>He described the case as a SLAPP : \"Strategic Litigation against Public Participation\". There has been growing concern about the use of such lawsuits to stifle public debate. <br/>The government has described them as an abuse, used to \"harass intimidate and financially exhaust an opponent\".<br/>Last year the government held a consultation on changing the law and an update is expected shortly.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Now he is nasty and bitter.\"<br/>So says a former cabinet minister who served under Boris Johnson.<br/> Conservative MPs are reflecting on the Privileges Committee report into Mr Johnson - and on how in the space of three and a half years he has gone from the triumph of winning a huge majority at a general election to being humiliated by his peers and no longer even in parliament.<br/>\"The martyr thing won't work,\" adds the former senior minister. <br/>\"He's the guy who was successful because he cracked jokes, made people feel better about themselves, and you'd want to go for a drink with. Now he's so angry.\"<br/>Angry he certainly has been in recent days. <br/>\"Rubbish\", a \"lie\", \"deranged\", \"absurd\" and \"complete tripe\" are just some of the words he has used to describe the report Westminster has been poring over.<br/>There are pockets of support for Boris Johnson on the Conservative benches, but they have rapidly shrivelled.<br/>\"I do think people who think Boris is immortal are either paranoid or bananas,\" another former minister tells me.<br/>In fact, the best way to ensure the anonymity of a Tory MP when describing what they have said in a private conversation is to say they are a \"former Johnson supporter\" - there are a lot of them.<br/>Here is one who texted me earlier: \"Johnson's followers and goodwill will diminish the more he and his acolytes damage the Party's electoral prospects. <br/>\"The Party is greater than any of its leaders. Leaders are leaseholders not freeholders. Johnson is not the victim here - it will be the British people if Keir Starmer enters Downing Street next year.\"<br/>It is a plea to the party to get over the era of Boris Johnson and unite around Rishi Sunak.<br/>But the reason so many Conservative MPs will only speak so candidly in private is that the business of getting over the era of Mr Johnson is not easy.<br/>One Tory MP acknowledged to me that a big chunk of their electorate voted for them because of Boris Johnson, that he was the \"Heineken Tory\"  - he could reach voters other Conservatives couldn't. <br/>And does Rishi Sunak hold the same appeal to them, I asked. <br/>\"No,\" came the reply.<br/>And there are plenty of Conservative Party members who have a loyalty and ongoing affection for Mr Johnson too - although how dented that might be by this week's report and his reaction to it will be interesting to observe.<br/>In short, the returns are rapidly diminishing for Mr Johnson's most vociferous parliamentary supporters.<br/>He's not coming back, at least in the short term. And he's not instantly easy to defend, either.<br/>Make no mistake, there are those who sympathise with him, including those who have not said so publicly. <br/>\"It is posturing parliament at its worst,\" one told me, having read the Privileges Committee report.<br/>But Boris Johnson has gone, from parliament at least, for now.<br/>Monday's debate and vote on the Privileges Committee report had looked like it might be a damp squib already, shorn as it was of the jeopardy shaping Mr Johnson's future, given he's already left.<br/>Conservative MPs had been told they would have a free vote, but on what is called a one line whip. <br/>In other words, it wouldn't matter if they didn't turn up. <br/>So plenty could avoid awkward conversations with their local associations and voters having voted this way or that, by finding something better to do.<br/>And now the Conservative MP James Duddridge, a former parliamentary aide to Mr Johnson, has told BBC News: \"I've spoken to Boris, he doesn't want there to be a vote. Everyone needs to calm down.\"<br/>Others close to Mr Johnson echo this instinct.<br/>Why would they be saying this? It is a vote he would lose, and badly, and it might expose just how shrivelled that parliamentary loyalty to him now is.<br/>But is this the end for Boris Johnson?<br/>I am reminded of the late Tony Benn's remark, when he said he was leaving the Commons \"to devote more time to politics\".<br/>Mr Johnson was never going to be short of offers of pulpits from which to project - and he's found one already: a column in the Daily Mail and Mail Online.<br/>His real power and influence now will be his capacity to attract attention and disrupt.<br/>And whatever your judgement about his other strengths and weaknesses, they are both things most would agree he is rather good at.<br/>It's a column Downing Street could rather do without.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

He had just been elected mayor of London, a job that would launch him on the path to Downing Street.<br/>Now he is heading for the exit with all guns blazing, with a scathing attack on the MPs who sought to punish him for misleading Parliament over Covid rule-breaking.<br/>His reaction to the Privileges Committee report is vintage Johnson - colourful, amusing in parts - the references to \"Mystic Meg\" and nudist colonies - but with an unfamiliar edge of bitterness and anger. <br/>Whether it turns out to be the final raging testament of a man destined for the political wilderness remains to be seen.<br/>He has bounced back from many, mainly self-inflicted, disasters before.<br/>And he is clearly in no mood to settle for comfortable semi-retirement. <br/>He has already earned more than \u00a35m for giving speeches around the world since he quit as prime minister.<br/>He is also about to become a father again, at 58, with wife Carrie expecting their third child. The family have just moved into a \u00a33.8m Grade II listed manor house in Oxfordshire, complete with its own moat.<br/>There are books to write - his memoir of his time in Downing Street is well under way apparently, and talk of business opportunities.<br/>But this may be thin gruel for someone with Boris Johnson's outsize personality.<br/>From his earliest childhood days, when he famously declared he wanted to be \"world king\", Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson has had his eyes on life's big prizes.<br/>He came into the world in 1964 in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in New York, where his father, Stanley, was studying economics. <br/>One of four children, he spent his early years on the family farm in Somerset, before moving to north London and then Brussels, where Stanley was working for the European Commission.<br/>The Johnson siblings were close and highly competitive with one another. Young Boris, or Al, as he was known to the family, was largely brought up by his artist mother Charlotte, helped by au pairs.<br/>He won a scholarship to Eton College, England's most prestigious private school, where he made a lasting impression on his teachers and classmates.<br/>In a widely quoted excerpt from a school report, teacher Martin Hammond said of the 17-year-old Johnson: \"Boris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility. <br/>\"I think he honestly believes it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.\"<br/>Simon Veksner, a school friend of Johnson, told author Simon Kuper in his recent book Chums: \"Boris's charisma even then was off the charts, so funny, warm, charming, self-deprecating,\" <br/>At Oxford University, he was elected president of the union - a debating society dating back to 1823. He also joined the infamously rowdy and exclusive Bullingdon Club, alongside future prime minister David Cameron.<br/>After Oxford, he was taken on as a trainee reporter at the Times newspaper, but was sacked after falsifying a quote. <br/>It proved to be a minor setback however, and in 1988 he was given a job on the Daily Telegraph by then-editor Max Hastings.<br/>As the Telegraph's Brussels correspondent, Johnson specialized in ridiculing regulations passed by the European Commission - although many of his fellow reporters in Brussels felt his stories were exaggerated and in some cases simply untrue. <br/>In 1999, he became editor of influential right-wing magazine the Spectator, and two years later finally achieved his ambition to enter Parliament, as the Tory MP for Henley, in Oxfordshire.<br/>Things did not go smoothly.<br/>He insisted on continuing to edit the Spectator, even when he was promoted to the Tory frontbench by then leader Michael Howard.<br/>He came unstuck in 2004 when the magazine published an article blaming the Hillsborough disaster on the behaviour of Liverpool football fans. <br/>An incensed Howard ordered Johnson to Liverpool to apologise to the entire city.<br/>He survived \"Operation Scouse Grovel\", as he dubbed it, only to be sacked by Howard a month later for lying about claims he had had an affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt.<br/>Johnson's colourful private life has long been a source of fascination for fellow journalists - in particular, the question of how many children he has fathered.<br/>He has declined to confirm a number when asked, but it is thought be seven, with another on the way.<br/>He has four children from his second marriage, to barrister Marina Wheeler, which ended in divorce, and another from an affair with art consultant Helen Macintyre.<br/>In May 2020, Johnson married Carrie Symonds, a former Tory aide, at a private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. The couple had their first son together, Wilfred, in April 2020. Their second child, daughter Romy, was born in December 2021.<br/>It was Johnson's two terms as London mayor - starting in 2008 - that transformed his political career. <br/>Up until then, he had been stuck in the slow lane, better known as a TV celebrity and comedy turn than a serious politician.<br/>His ability to harvest votes from Labour supporters - and project an upbeat, positive vision of Conservativism - made him a powerful electoral asset for his party.<br/>His popularity reached its peak during the 2012 London Olympics, despite, or perhaps because of, being pictured dangling from a zip wire gamely waving a pair of union flags. <br/>In 2015, he returned to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, with his sights set on the top job, and a major dilemma. David Cameron's decision to hold an EU referendum was a defining moment for the country, but also for the old friends and rivals.<br/>Johnson's decision - after much agonising - to join forces with the pro-Brexit campaign came as a severe blow to Cameron's hopes of keeping the UK in the EU. But it was seen as a game-changing moment by the pro-Brexit campaign, run by tough-talking strategist Dominic Cummings, a man Cameron had once dismissed as a \"career psychopath\".<br/>When his side emerged victorious, Johnson threw his hat into the ring to replace Cameron as Conservative leader and prime minister. <br/>However, his campaign was dramatically undermined when colleague and close friend Michael Gove withdrew support and decided to run for the leadership himself, saying he did not think Johnson was up to the job of prime minister. <br/>Not for the first time, he was contemplating the end of his political career. Yet in a surprise move Theresa May, the eventual winner, appointed Johnson as foreign secretary.<br/>He quit May's cabinet in 2018, in protest at her Brexit deal, which he claimed would lead Britain into \"the status of a colony\". <br/>When she was forced to resign as Tory leader the following year, he finally got his hands on the top job.<br/>He was immediately plunged into turmoil, as he battled to govern with the non-existent majority inherited from May.<br/>In an audacious and highly controversial move, later ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court, he attempted to prorogue, or suspend, Parliament, after his attempts to push through a Brexit deal faltered ahead of his own deadline of 31 October 2019.<br/>After two failed attempts to get MPs to vote for a general election, he finally went to the country in December 2019, promising to \"Get Brexit Done\", a slogan dreamed up by Dominic Cummings, who was now his closest aide.<br/>The gamble paid off, and he was returned to power with the biggest Conservative majority since Margaret Thatcher's 1980s heyday. Crucially, he had won seats in former Labour strongholds across the North of England, what came to be known as the Red Wall.<br/>His Brexit deal was approved and on 31 January 2020 the UK left the EU. <br/>It looked as though negotiating a trade deal with the EU would be his government's first key task - and Brexit his abiding legacy. But, within weeks, he was engulfed by an all-consuming crisis that few - least of all Mr Johnson - had seen coming: the coronavirus pandemic.<br/>In April 2020, he tested positive for Covid himself and spent three nights in intensive care. Downing Street played down the seriousness of his condition but when he was discharged, the PM admitted \"it could have gone either way\".<br/>As the UK emerged from the pandemic, Mr Johnson's government was under fire from all sides for its handling of the pandemic.<br/>He hailed the success of the UK's vaccine roll-out, which was the fastest in the developed world.<br/>But his political problems were mounting up.<br/>In November 2020, he lost Dominic Cummings and other senior aides after a bout of bitter infighting in Downing Street.<br/>Worse was to come in November 2021, when the Daily Mirror accused Johnson of breaking Covid rules by attending parties in Downing Street when indoor mixing was banned. There was a further bombshell just over a week later when video footage emerged of Downing Street staff laughing and joking about holding a Christmas party. <br/>Then the Daily Telegraph revealed that Downing Street staff had held booze-fuelled parties the night before the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral. Johnson later apologised to the Queen.<br/>Johnson, his then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Carrie Johnson were among those fined by police, while a damning report by senior civil servant Sue Gray laid bare a Downing Street culture of drunkenness and contempt for the rules.<br/>Johnson did his best to sound contrite in public, telling MPs he had learned lessons and had launched a shake-up of backroom staff, but he continued to insist that he had not broken Covid rules on purpose.<br/>The cabinet rallied round the prime minister, but a steadily growing band of backbench Conservatives, from different wings of the party, had come to the conclusion that he had to go, amid rising public anger. <br/>He survived a confidence motion in June 2022, despite nearly half of his MPs voting against him. But a string of by-election defeats led MPs to fear he had become an electoral liability. The old magic, it seemed, was no longer working.<br/>The final straw for many MPs was when ministers were sent out to defend the prime minister in a row over an MP facing allegations of sexual misconduct, armed with misleading information from Downing Street.<br/>A mass walkout by ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, followed and after 48 hours of defiance, in which he repeatedly vowed to \"get on with the job\" of governing, he was finally forced to face up to reality.<br/>He did not go quietly. And within a few short months he would get an unexpected chance to make another comeback, following the spectacular implosion of Liz Truss's premiership.<br/>He flew back from a Caribbean holiday in October 2022 to launch a bid to replace Truss, who had won the contest to replace him. <br/>But despite managing to scrape together just enough nominations from Tory MPs to get on the ballot, Johnson pulled out of the contest, paving the way for the coronation of Rishi Sunak, who had far more support in the Parliamentary party.<br/>He insisted he would remain an MP, fuelling rumours that another comeback might be on the cards.<br/>But questions about his conduct during the Covid pandemic refused to go away, with the committee of MPs investigating whether he had lied to Parliament eventually delivering their damning verdict.<br/>Only a fool would write Boris Johnson off entirely - and he retains a band of loyal supporters, who point to his leadership over the war in Ukraine and his espousal of traditional Tory free market values as reasons for his return - not to mention his formidable campaigning skills.<br/>But the road back looks like a long and steep one.<br/>\u00a9 2023 BBC.

This does not apply for \"personal\" actions against them, for example if they are sued for libel.<br/>As a former minister, he would normally be expected to receive taxpayer-funded legal help for his evidence to the ongoing Covid inquiry.<br/>Documents submitted to the inquiry show that he was receiving support from the government's in-house legal department, but he cut ties with them in May after being referred to police for potential rule breaches during the pandemic.<br/>Shortly afterwards, he said he was \"instructing new solicitors\" but this was dependent on funding being agreed with the Cabinet Office.<br/>The department, however, has since said he won't get funding if he tries to \"undermine\" the government's position in relation to the inquiry, amid a row over the submission of his unredacted WhatsApps.<br/>All former prime ministers since John Major have been entitled to a yearly \u00a3115,000 allowance to support their \"special position in public life\".<br/>They can claim from it to fund things like running an office, paying for staff, and travel to events where they are appearing as an ex-PM. The money can't be used to support private or parliamentary duties.<br/>It is not yet known whether Mr Johnson has claimed it since leaving No 10, as the most recent annual figures are yet to be published.<br/>Former premiers have not always claimed the full amount. It is not paid automatically, and they have to provide receipts.<br/>In addition, they can claim up to 10% of the yearly allowance to put towards the pensions of their staff.<br/>Ex-MPs are entitled to a parliamentary pass, the so-called former member's pass, which was known as an \"X\" pass.<br/>It gives access to certain parts of Parliament and some of the catering facilities.<br/>Former MPs are not allowed to use the pass to help with \"lobbying\" - or trying to influence - government ministers.<br/>But the committee has recommended that Mr Johnson shouldn't be given one. All MPs will vote on the suggested sanction next week. <br/>He will also remain a member of the Privy Council, the body that meets around once a month to get the monarch's formal approval for government orders approved by ministers.<br/>There are several hundred privy councillors, although only current members of the government are involved in day-to-day business.<br/>All cabinet ministers, including prime ministers, are appointed for life.<br/>The only prime minister to have been removed from the list of privy councillors was short-lived premier William Cavendish, who was struck off by King George III when he suspected him of plotting against him. <br/>What happens for Boris Johnson now he's resigned?<br/>Calls for Truss not to take yearly \u00a3115,000 as ex-PM<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

This was when he said he had corrected the record (referring to his statement of 8 December 2021).<br/>\"When I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell\", he said. <br/>Committee chair Harriet Harman asked him if he still believed that to be the case in March 2023 and he replied: \"My view remains that the guidance allowed social distancing not to be carried out with rigid, drill sergeant precision.\"<br/>We know that at least two of the events that he attended (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether the rule breaches happened when he was there.<br/>When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. <br/>The initial report from the Privileges Committee said it had received evidence that Mr Johnson had said at the 27 November 2020 event that it was \"probably the most unsocially distanced gathering in the UK right now\".<br/>Mr Johnson said he did not remember saying that, but pointed out that the official who had provided that quote went on to say of the former prime minister: \"he had a glass of water in his hand, made a short speech and then went up to his flat. He was the most sensible person there to be honest.\"<br/>What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

These include immunity from legal prosecution for anything said in Parliament, to allow MPs to speak freely.<br/>The committee was established in its current form in 2013 in the House of Commons. Similar work was previously done by a larger committee called the Standards and Privileges Committee. <br/>Ahead of the release of its report, Boris Johnson accused members of the committee of having a bias against him. He said: \"Their purpose from the beginning has been to find me guilty, regardless of the facts.\"<br/>However, four of the seven members of the committee are Conservative MPs (Sir Bernard Jenkin, Sir Charles Walker, Andy Carter and Alberto Costa).<br/>Two members are Labour MPs (Harriet Harman and Yvonne Fovargue) and one represents the SNP (Allan Dorans).<br/>The rules state the chair has to be a member of the official opposition - ie from the Labour party. Harriet Harman was unanimously elected to the post in June 2022.<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: What is the hearing all about? Harriet Harman explains<br/>The committee has said that if Mr Johnson had not already resigned as an MP, it would have recommended a 90-day suspension, which is an unusually long period.<br/>A suspension of more than two weeks can trigger something called a recall petition, which in turn could lead to a by-election.<br/>Two MPs on the committee - the SNP's Allan Dorans and Labour's Yvonne Fovargue - wanted Mr Johnson expelled from the House of Commons - a far more serious sanction.<br/>In addition to the suspension, the committee also recommended that he should not be given a parliamentary pass, as is common for former MPs.<br/>Commons leader Penny Mordaunt has confirmed that MPs will be able to debate \"an amendable motion\" related to the report in Parliament on Monday. <br/>The debate will be followed by a free vote, which means political parties will not tell MPs what to do. <br/>Boris Johnson was widely criticised for describing the committee as \"a kangaroo court\" in his resignation statement.<br/>The phrase generally refers to a group acting without legal authority which hastily reaches a verdict without considering evidence.<br/>Mr Johnson's conduct was referred to the committee after a vote in the House of Commons in April 2022. It did not call for evidence until June 2022, once the police investigation into Partygate had finished.<br/>At his evidence hearing, Mr Johnson criticised committee chair Harriet Harman for having \"said some things about this matter before reading the evidence\". <br/>He was referring to comments she made on Twitter in April 2022, when she said that if Boris Johnson and then Chancellor Rishi Sunak accepted a fine for a lockdown breaking party, \"they are also admitting that they misled the House of Commons\".<br/>Ms Harman replaced the previous chair Sir Chris Bryant, who decided he should not lead the investigation because of his previous criticism of Mr Johnson's rule-breaking. <br/>No - it can also decide if non-MPs have been in contempt of Parliament.<br/>In 2019, the Privileges Committee examined the refusal of Boris Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings to give evidence to another parliamentary committee.<br/>It found that Mr Cummings was in contempt of Parliament and recommended that the House of Commons should pass a resolution criticising him. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Like all prime ministerial trips abroad, it wasn't exactly typical.<br/>Here are four things that make travelling with the prime minister a unique experience.<br/>For years the debate raged. Was it legitimate for the prime minister to have a plane they could call their own?<br/>The issue made headlines during Tony Blair's premiership - when, inevitably, the prospect of such a thing was called Blair Force One. In 2006, a plan was announced. But in 2008, when Gordon Brown was prime minister, it was scrapped.<br/>Is a private jet ostentatious? Does it help with the practicalities of being a frequently flying leader? Does it project an image of the UK abroad that you wouldn't get turning up on a chartered plane? <br/>For now at least, the debate is over: the prime minister does have access to his own plane. And I type these words sitting on it, somewhere over the Atlantic.<br/>It is an Airbus A321, with a union flag on the tail fin, and \"United Kingdom\" written down the side. <br/>When you fly on this thing, it is rather different from rolling up at the airport to go on holiday. We leave from a private terminal, we often don't get a boarding pass and usually we take all of our baggage on with us - for a reason I'll get to shortly.<br/>But meanwhile\u2026<br/>You might imagine, in a private jet, the entertainment system would be something else. <br/>There is WiFi, so the prime minister and his team can stay connected and work efficiently, which is something they value. And it helps us reporters too.<br/>On the plane, there are none of those little screens you get in the back of the seat in front of you on some flights, packed with films and playlists and maps showing precisely where you are over the ocean. Instead, we often have what is called a \"huddle\".<br/>A huddle involves the prime minister coming to the back of the plane, where reporters crowd around him, and each ask him a question.<br/>This is how it works: all the reporters get together beforehand, in the airport, to work out what we are going to ask, in what order, to ensure we cover a range of topics. <br/>The conversation is \"on the record\" - to use the jargon - meaning we can quote the words and attribute them to the prime minister. But the huddle is not recorded for television or radio. <br/>A round of on-camera interviews with the prime minister tends to happen later in the trip. Each broadcaster is assigned a strictly agreed amount of time - often seven minutes - to attempt to find things out, hold the government to account and test its arguments. <br/>Interviewing any prime minister is a huge privilege and responsibility: working on your behalf, trying to ask the questions you want asking. I will always ask the brilliant producer I am working with to stand just out of shot counting down the minutes I have left on their fingers. <br/>Journalistically, there is a tension on these trips: we are close to the prime minister and his team throughout. This is useful, in understanding what they are doing and what motivates their decisions. But instinctively reporters want to be detached, independent and disinterested, and being in what can feel like a bubble feels odd in that context.<br/>Oh, and if we are going somewhere on a long-haul flight - for example Indonesia, Japan or the west coast of America, as we've have recently - we end up having to stop to refuel. <br/>And so those trips involved landing in Dubai, Muscat, Almaty and Washington, hanging around for an hour or so, and then taking off again. <br/>There aren't huge queues to check in. Or any queues at all. <br/>There are comfy settees to sit on, there is loads of natural light and a free coffee machine. To say it feels different from when you head off on a family holiday with the kids is to put it gently. Mind you, I don't take laptops, a tripod, and no end of other broadcasting kit with me on holiday either. <br/>Recently, we flew back into Luton Airport in the middle of the night and pulled up at a private terminal. Past the entrance to what was described as the \"VVIP lounge\" (I couldn't see in, I'm afraid) was a glass cabinet proffering stuff from Harrods, including a collection of pink teddies complete with \"recycled polyester filling\". <br/>A large rectangular steel clock hung on the wall. \"We commissioned this clock from Beaumont flying art,\" read the inscription. Also on the wall, a colossal screen, pitching the merits of executive private jets, the kind that only carry a handful of passengers. \"15 hours of peaceful luxury!\" is how they describe the flight on offer.<br/>When the prime minister's plane lands abroad, a diplomatic ritual begins. As the plane pulls up, a smiling delegation greets us. <br/>One of the first people off the plane is the camera journalist assigned to film the prime minister's arrival on behalf of all the broadcasters. There might be a red carpet. There are almost always flags.<br/>The UK ambassador to wherever we are will be there at the bottom of the plane steps. Maybe even some sort of performance will be offered by the hosts - at Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport last autumn, it was a troupe of traditional dancers.<br/>And while the prime minister is getting off via the front set of steps, the rest of us are piling off at the back and getting into a seemingly never-ending line of minibuses waiting on the tarmac.<br/>There's no time to wait for a bag in the hold. That's why we take them onto the plane with us.<br/>In next to no time, the motorcade is moving - and moving fast. Police outriders swarm all around us, and junctions are closed, so we can race through.<br/>On the motorway, the fast lane is (temporarily) closed so we can zip by. Passers by can be lining the streets, sometimes, to grab pictures. <br/>On a recent trip to Japan, the press minibus wasn't the nippiest, its engine squealing to keep up with the slick Mercedes of the prime minister a dozen or so vehicles ahead.<br/>What Sunak\u2019s Atlantic Declaration is \u2013 and isn\u2019t<br/>Sunak and Biden announce green funding agreement<br/>Sunak to raise trade issues in US talks with Biden<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

They can also ask for more guidance from COPFS.<br/>If a suspect is charged with a crime, they generally cannot be questioned again by the police although they can make a statement. <br/>Ultimately, the detectives will send what is called a standard prosecution report to COPFS.<br/>Prosecutors will then consider whether there is sufficient evidence to suggest a crime was committed and the suspect was responsible.<br/>They will take the public interest into account. That can be influenced by the particular circumstances of the case - for example, whether the person involved was in a position of trust or authority.<br/>If they feel the evidence meets the necessary tests, the case will go to court.<br/>Alternatively, COPFS can instruct the police to carry out further inquiries if they decide there is insufficient evidence.<br/>If they are still not satisfied there is enough to justify a prosecution, the case would go no further.<br/>The law officers at the top of the Crown Office will not be involved in this lengthy process.<br/>The Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC and Solicitor General Ruth Charteris KC have dual roles as public prosecutors and principal legal advisors to the Scottish government, which has been run by the SNP since 2007.<br/>For that reason, they will not be consulted when a decision is made about what should happen to Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell or Mr Beattie, with that task falling to others. <br/>And for anyone wondering why the inquiry is called Operation Branchform, the titles for Police Scotland investigations are picked at random and the name does not actually mean anything.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Established and funded by government, they are led by an independent chair.<br/>An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses and can demand evidence. <br/>No one is found guilty or innocent, but conclusions about lessons learned are published. Inquiries can make recommendations although these do not have to be adopted by ministers. <br/>The Covid inquiry, launched by Boris Johnson in May 2021, covers decision-making during the pandemic in both Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>At the time, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK's response would be \"under the microscope\". <br/>It is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer.<br/>She previously led the inquests into the 7/7 London bombings.<br/>The inquiry has no formal deadline but is due to hold public hearings across the UK until at least 2025.<br/>At the first public hearing in London, Baroness Hallett said she planned to publish updates and reports \"as we go along\" on the inquiry's website. <br/>Public hearings are streamed on the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts will be published on its website.<br/>Members of the public can apply to attend public hearings in person. <br/>The inquiry is split into different parts.<br/>Work in four areas has already begun:<br/>Future strands - with hearings due in 2024 and 2025 - will look at:<br/>Scotland is also holding a separate inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett's team is expected to focus on the biggest and most controversial aspects of the government's response, including:<br/>The inquiry is also expected to consider whether too many restrictions were imposed as the pandemic progressed. <br/>Over the course of 80 days in autumn 2020, for example, England went from the so-called \"rule of six\" to a tiered system of regulations, then into a national lockdown and then back to tiers.<br/>The government's policy towards schools is also likely to be on the agenda. Schools closed to most pupils in March 2020 and then again in January 2021.  <br/>The first public hearings have taken evidence from independent experts, including infectious-diseases specialist Prof David Heymann, and some government officials. <br/>Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne will appear before the committee in the second week of hearings, as will the current Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, and Chancellor (and former Health Secretary) Jeremy Hunt. <br/>Sir Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser during the pandemic, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser will also give evidence. <br/>Members of the public have been invited to share their experiences through the inquiry's Every Story Matters project.<br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group - which has been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic - has urged the inquiry to ensure these voices are heard.<br/>The inquiry asked to see unredacted WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and 40 people. <br/>They include former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and former chancellor and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. <br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. He said earlier messages were not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and had not been used since. <br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>Covid-19 Public Inquiry<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

And it was prominent.<br/>At Labour's 2021 conference, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves announced her ambition to be the UK's first \"green\" chancellor.<br/>To stress her bona fides, she pledged to invest \u00a328bn a year, every year to 2030 to \"green\" the economy.<br/>Labour's Green Prosperity Plan was one of its defining policies. It gave the party a clear dividing line with government.<br/>Ms Reeves said there would be \"no dither, and no delay\" in tackling the climate crisis.<br/>It was also an answer to the government's \"levelling up\" pledge.<br/>The borrowed cash would underpin well-paid jobs in every corner of the UK in the energy sector.<br/>So why has Ms Reeves kicked the pledge into the second half of the next Parliament, if Labour wins?<br/>The first reason is obvious. <br/>Ms Reeves now says she was \"green\" - in a different sense of the word - in 2021, in that she hadn't foreseen what then-Prime Minister Liz Truss would do to the economy.<br/>With interest rates up, the cost of borrowing rises too, making the \u00a328bn pledge more expensive to deliver.<br/>And Ms Reeves wants to emphasise that if any spending commitments clash with her fiscal rules, the rules would win every time.<br/>But did the \u00a328bn green pledge really clash with her rules?<br/>In their own detailed briefing on their fiscal rules, Labour said: \"It is essential that for our future prosperity that we retain the ability to borrow for investing in capital projects which over time will pay for themselves.<br/>\"And that is why our target for eliminating the deficit excludes investment.\"<br/>So borrowing to invest in the future technology and jobs shouldn't fall foul of that fiscal rule.<br/>But there is another rule which Ms Reeves cited this morning - to have debt falling as a percentage of GDP or Gross Domestic Product, a measure of economic activity. <br/>Meeting that rule may have contributed to putting the \u00a328bn on the backburner - though I remember at the 2021 conference some senior Labour figures questioning the wisdom of borrowing the equivalent of half the defence budget every year even then.<br/>And some senior figures in Labour are far less convinced that \u00a328bn would necessarily bust the debt rule - economic forecasts can change by far greater margins.<br/>One of the other justifications for the change of position is that \u00a328bn shouldn't be poured in to the economy straight away. <br/>That's because it will take time to train workers, to create and bolster supply chains. Hence \"ramping up\" to \u00a328bn. <br/>One shadow minister said that while today's announcement felt like a bit of a handbrake turn, it was nonetheless inevitable and sensible.<br/>The scale of the ambition remained the same, but pragmatically the shadow chancellor was simply not committing to spending which would be difficult to deliver.<br/>But all this must have been known in 2021, too.<br/>So why announce the U-turn today?<br/>The change of position was discussed within Labour's Treasury team for some time.<br/>Engagement with investors convinced them the government itself may not need to pump in a huge amount of cash straight away - the private sector would provide green jobs without state help. <br/>And while Ms Reeves has ditched the \u00a328bn pledge in the first half of the Parliament, this doesn't mean that a Labour government would spend nothing on its Green Prosperity Plan.<br/>I understand cash will be prioritised for projects where the private sector would not commit without state assistance - nuclear and hydrogen for example.<br/>But it seems clear that politics and not just economics played a role in today's announcement. <br/>There have been grumbles and growls over how the policy has landed over the past two years within Labour's ranks and internal criticism has increased, not receded.<br/>One concern was that the amount to be borrowed - the \u00a328bn - was better known than what the money would buy - from home insulation and heat pumps to new carbon capture technology.<br/>But it was crystal clear this week that the Conservatives felt that they had seen a vulnerability that could be exploited.<br/>The front page of the Daily Mail blared this week about the alleged dangers of the policy - the extra borrowing would put up interest and therefore mortgage costs.<br/>The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies was also being cited by Conservative ministers. <br/>Its director Paul Johnson had warned that while additional borrowing would pump money in to the economy, it also drives up interest rates.<br/>As Labour has been attacking the Conservatives for their handling of the economy, and the \"mortgage premium\" they claim the government has caused, it was understandable that they did not want the same attack to be aimed at them, and Ms Reeves this morning sought to eliminate a potential negative.<br/>As one Labour shadow minister put it: \"They [the Conservatives] will be pulling their hair out that one of their attack lines has failed.\"<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Rachel Reeves says Labour will now \"ramp up\" its plan to spend \u00a328bn a year on green industries<br/>Some in Labour's ranks, though, believe the party should have insulated (no pun intended) itself from attack by making the case more stridently that borrowing to invest is different from borrowing to meet day-to-day spending.<br/>Labour's opinion poll lead is wide but pessimists in their ranks fear it is shallow. <br/>Establishing economic credibility is seen as key.<br/>But while it may have been the lesser of two evils, today's change of tack isn't cost-free.<br/>The party has committed to achieve a net-zero power system by 2030. <br/>But with potentially significantly less investment, is this target in danger too?<br/>And unlike many of the left-wing commitments that have been ditched - where the leadership don't really mind the backlash - this was the shadow chancellor watering down her own highest-profile pledge.<br/>That in itself has allowed the Conservatives to shout about Labour's economic plans being \"in tatters\". <br/>As Labour is still committed to its Green Prosperity Plan - just not the original timescale - they will still claim they have clear dividing lines with the government.<br/>But one of their key arguments has been this: With the US pouring subsidies in to domestic green industries, the UK will get left behind if it doesn't follow suit. And fast.<br/>A delay doesn't destroy - but it does potentially weaken - the Labour case.<br/>But there is another concern amongst those who are most certainly not on the Corbyn left.<br/>Emphasising competence and fiscal credibility over climate change commitments could leave some target voters cold.<br/>Labour waters down \u00a328bn green projects pledge<br/>Labour unveils Biden-inspired economic strategy<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Do you want pliers involved? Do you want a screwdriver?\" The resulting video was \"the most grotesque thing I have ever seen,\" he said.<br/>McCartney, a former motorcycle gang member who spent time in prison before entering the monkey torture world, ended up running several Telegram groups in which hardcore torture enthusiasts distributed videos. <br/>\"It's no different than drug money,\" he said. \"Drug money comes from dirty hands, this money comes from bloody hands.\"<br/>The BBC also identified two other key suspects who are now being investigated by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - Stacey Storey, a grandmother in her 40s from Alabama who was known in the community as \"Sadistic\", and a ringleader known as \"Mr Ape\" - whose real name we cannot reveal for safety reasons.<br/>\"Mr Ape\" confessed in an interview with the BBC that he had been responsible for the deaths of at least four monkeys and the torture of many more. He had commissioned \"extremely brutal\" videos, he said.<br/>Storey's phone was seized by Department of Homeland Security agents, who found nearly 100 torture videos, as well as evidence that she had paid for the creation of some of the most extreme videos produced. <br/>According to police sources, Storey was active in a torture group as recently as earlier this month. Approached by the BBC in Alabama in January, Storey claimed that she had been hacked and declined to comment on the allegations in detail. <br/>\"Mr Ape\", Stacey Storey and Mike McCartney are three of five key targets in the ongoing Homeland Security investigation. They have yet to be charged, but could face up to seven years in prison if prosecuted based on evidence gathered by the DHS.<br/>Special Agent Paul Wolpert, who is leading the DHS investigation, said everyone involved from law enforcement had been deeply shocked by the nature of the alleged crimes.<br/>\"I don't know if anybody would ever be ready for a crime like this,\" he said. \"The same with the attorneys and the juries, and anybody who reads that this is going on. It is going to be a shocker I think.\"<br/>Anybody involved in buying or distributing the monkey torture videos should \"expect a knock on the door at some point\", Agent Wolpert said. \"You are not going to get away with it.\"<br/>Police in Indonesia have arrested two torture suspects. Asep Yadi Nurul Hikmah was charged with animal torture and the sale of a protected species, and sentenced to three years in prison. M Ajis Rasjana was sentenced to eight months - the maximum sentence available for torturing an animal.<br/>Monkey torture videos are still easily accessible on Telegram and now Facebook, where the BBC recently found dozens of groups sharing extreme content, some with more than 1,000 members.<br/>\"We've seen an escalation in this extreme, graphic content, which used to be hidden but is now circulating openly on platforms like Facebook,\" said Sarah Kite, co-founder of animal charity Action for Primates. <br/>Facebook told the BBC it had removed the groups we brought to the company's attention. \"We don't allow the promotion of animal abuse on our platforms and we remove this content when we become aware of it, like we did in this case,\" a spokesperson said.<br/>Ms Kite also called for UK laws to be updated to make it easier to prosecute individuals who pay for torture videos to be made. \"If someone is proactively involved in inflicting that pain by paying for it and providing a list of things they want done to the animal, there should be stronger laws to hold them to account,\" she said.<br/>YouTube told the BBC in a statement that animal abuse had \"no place\" on the platform and the company was \"working hard to quickly remove violative content\". <br/>\"Just this year alone, we've removed hundreds of thousands of videos and terminated thousands of channels for violating our violent and graphic policies,\" the statement said.<br/>Telegram said it was \"committed to protecting user privacy and human rights such as freedom of speech\", adding that its moderators \"cannot proactively patrol private groups\".<br/>The Monkey Haters<br/>You can read the full story on the BBC News website, watch the documentary The Monkey Haters on BBC iPlayer (UK only), on YouTube, or listen to the radio version on BBC Sounds. <br/>Hunting the monkey torturers<br/>Catching the men who sell subway groping videos<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

As we continue to pump vast quantities of planet-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere we are driving up global temperatures.<br/>But other factors are likely also playing a role.<br/>Professor Michael Mann, an atmospheric scientist at Penn State University, says weaker than average winds have reduced the amount of dust from the Sahara Desert in the atmosphere. <br/>Saharan dust blocks and reflects some of the sun's energy out of the atmosphere, moderating sea temperatures.<br/>The trade winds have been unusually light this year and, at the same time, a persistent weather pattern with easterly winds from the continental US may also have helped warm the sea surface.<br/>Another factor could be the effects of a reduction in pollution from shipping.<br/>Regulations reducing the sulphur content of fuel burned by ships were brought in by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in 2020.<br/>This significantly reduces the amount of aerosol particles released into the atmosphere, the IMO says. <br/>But aerosols that pollute the air can also help reflect heat back into space, so removing them may have caused more heat to enter the waters. <br/>It looks like the impacts of the exceptional temperatures in the North Atlantic are already beginning to be felt.<br/>The eastern tropical Atlantic is the main spawning ground for North Atlantic hurricanes and the Met Office says an Atlantic tropical storm looks likely to form east of the Caribbean by the middle of this week. <br/>Julian Heming, a tropical cyclone expert at the Met Office, says it is very unusual to see a storm developing in that area so early in the season.<br/>Hurricane development is normally supressed during El Ni\u00f1o periods, but the Met Office's forecast suggests an above average season for tropical storms and cyclones in the North Atlantic basin this year because of the high surface temperatures.<br/>The Met Office says we can expect the hot weather to continue.<br/>It says there is a 45% chance - significantly higher than usual - that the UK will have what it describes as a \"hot summer\".<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Potable water in her shelter comes in trickles so she makes sure to keep one red pail full for her family of four. They are also in need of electricity to keep their mobile phones and rechargeable fans juiced up.<br/>\"What can we do but to endure this?\" she asks.<br/>In another shelter, Benjamin Nasol, a motor taxi driver, worries about the small pig farm he left behind. Every night he returns to his home in Camalig town for a few hours to ensure that his animals are fed and safe from thieves.<br/>\"We are used to it,\" the 53-year-old tells the BBC. He says the sight of molten rocks cascading from Mayon's crater does not scare him one bit as it is his third time in a volcano shelter.<br/>\"Even if you are weary or exhausted, you need to do your obligations in the village, then you come back to your family here in the evacuation centre,\" he says.<br/>State scientists flagged increased activity on Mayon in early June, after they observed more frequent earthquakes and rockfalls from the crater. It is now under the third-highest alert based on a five-tier scale that measures the probability of an explosive eruption.<br/>Technically, Mayon is erupting, albeit at a slow pace.<br/>From a hilltop observatory, volcanologist Paul Alanis looks for visual cues that could upgrade the alert level. Those alerts then determine how many people will need to be evacuated. When Level 3 was declared on 8 June, at least 13,000 people were immediately moved to shelters. Several thousands more were evacuated in the succeeding days.<br/>For what's invisible to the naked eye, Mr Alanis uses a seismometer to measure movements underground.<br/>The most telling sign that Mayon was acting up was the swelling of a dome on its crater that was left by its last lava eruption in 2018, Mr Alanis says. That so-called lava dome appeared to be growing as early as April this year. <br/>There was a sense of anxiety in the observatory last week. <br/>\"At any time, the condition of the volcano could escalate. We had to prioritise to get the people out,\" Mr Alanis tells the BBC.<br/>The volcanologist's job also includes explaining what's happening in Mayon to the provincial governor and disaster response officials so that they can prepare accordingly.<br/>The slow-moving lava flows could mean two things, Mr Alanis says. It's either there's not enough hot gas inside the volcano for an explosive eruption or that the molten rock's path is clogged, preventing gas from escaping to the surface.<br/>\"We need to find other reasons why is that happening. But right now, I can't really tell,\" he says. \"At the moment, there's no technology that can predict when a volcano would erupt.\"<br/>The Philippines has 24 active volcanoes and is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, so-called for its history of volcanic activity.<br/>On the same week as the evacuations, a 5.5 magnitude earthquake that's unrelated to Mayon struck south of the capital, Manila, resulting in the temporary evacuation of office towers and high-rise buildings.<br/>But Mayon is the most fabled of the country's volcanoes, thanks to its near-perfect shape. It's the world's most conical volcano, according to Guinness.<br/>The fiery-red glow of lava on the crater has attracted throngs of tourists. It has also inspired internet memes about Daragang Magayon - a beautiful maiden from local Bicol folklore - and about Filipino Australian beauty queen Catriona Gray, who won the 2018 Miss Universe crown wearing a gown in the colour of Mayon's lava flows.<br/>For Zaira San Pascual, life in the shelter is more difficult because she had to move her late father's wake to the tent village.<br/>The 39-year-old Manila office worker was on the bus to Bicol when her family phoned her to say that they were moving to a shelter. \"How could we do it?\" she remembers asking herself in panic.<br/>Once she settled in, she realised that the situation was not as bad as the ones she experienced when she was a kid.<br/>\"You'll see people smiling, laughing, joking around. It's their coping mechanism, their way of not thinking about how grim their condition is here,\" she says.<br/>In the calm of night, people at the shelter have no choice but to wait and keep themselves entertained. They huddle in small groups to swap jokes on who has become the Marites - neighbourhood gossip - in their tent village. <br/>While evacuation from inside danger zones is mandatory, there are still those who refuse to leave their homes, like 72-year-old Roger Asilo.<br/>Mr Asilo hid behind a tree to avoid being hauled on board a lorry that transferred Guinobatan villagers to shelters.<br/>Over the decades, he feels he has learnt when the volcano is acting up enough for him to pack his bags. His son is also staying behind to look after him.<br/>Mr Asilo says he prefers to look after two pigs that a friend left in his care for a fee. <br/>At night, he watches the glowing lava flows seated on a bamboo bench outside his home.<br/>\"Every time I look at the volcano spewing lava, I always pray that it would stop,\" he tells the BBC.<br/>\"I am scared but I am prepared.\"<br/>Thousands evacuated as Philippine volcano oozes lava<br/>One doctor. 13,000 remote islanders.

The problem though is that often employees of coal, oil and gas companies are not open about their affiliations. <br/>At COP26 in Glasgow, there were more delegates from the fossil fuel industries than from any single country.<br/>Last year at COP27 in Egypt, the numbers had swollen by a quarter, with more than 600 representatives according to analysis from campaign group, Global Witness.<br/>With registration for delegates to this year's COP28 summit in Dubai set to open soon, the UN will now put in place a mandatory question on affiliation. <br/>\"From now onwards, every single badged participant attending the event will be required to list their affiliation and relationship to that organisation,\" said UN climate chief Simon Stiell, speaking at the closing of a preparatory meeting in Bonn.<br/>Campaigners say the step is long overdue.<br/>\"As long as UN climate talks have existed, the fossil fuel industry lobbyists have been flooding these talks seeking a seat at the table where the rules of climate action are written,\" said Rachel Rose Jackson from Corporate Accountability.<br/>\"It's actually no small thing that for the first time ever, all participants, will have to be honest to the world about who they are.\"<br/>Observers say that the new requirement might prevent a recurrence of what happened last year when BP chair Bernard Looney attended the talks as a delegate of Mauritania, a poor African country where the company has major investments. <br/>Similarly, four senior employees of Total, the French oil company, came to the COP as representatives of a mysterious German environmental campaign group. <br/>However while information on a delegate's affiliation will now be mandatory, participants will be allowed to opt out on the nature of their relationship to that organisation. <br/>There will also be no requirement to say who's financing the trip to the COP.<br/>If delegates do opt out from providing some information, the UN will publish these blank answers in their lists, allowing people to draw their own conclusions.<br/>\"This information should help prevent those representing the interests of fossil fuels from sneaking through the back door without declaring their true intentions,\" said Alice Harrison, from Global Witness, who compile an annual list of fossil fuel delegates attending the COP. <br/>\"We'll be certain to dig into those who refuse to declare.\" <br/>The move comes as delegates left the meeting in Bonn meeting meant to prepare the ground for COP28.<br/>Deep divisions between rich and poor were again apparent, with huge frustration on the part of developing countries that their financial needs are not being met, as climate impacts ramp up around the world. <br/>\"The credibility of this process is under threat.

CGI said  it was more than 90% accurate during a test run.<br/>It's being trialled in what's known as the North Devon Biosphere Reserve, a 55-sq-mile (142-sq-km) protected area that includes important natural habitats as well as farmland and small towns. <br/>\"We'll give (the AI) the history,\" said CGI's chief sustainability officer Mattie Yeta. \"We'll give it all of the geographic information, as well as data sets from the sensors for it to learn and develop the predictive mechanisms to be able to inform where these incidents are occurring and indeed when they will take place.\"<br/>It's hoped the project could clean up the seaside resort town of Combe Martin, where the quality of bathing water has long been a concern. <br/>\"It's always been bumping along the bottom in terms of water quality,\" says Andy Bell from the North Devon Biosphere Reserve.<br/>Though the water at Combe Martin was last year rated by the Environment Agency as 'good', Mr Bell says that was mainly down to dry weather.  More typical years, he says, were 2018 and 2019 when it received a 'poor' rating, which meant a notice being posted advising people not to swim. <br/>\"There is very much a fear in the community of what would happen if the bathing water status was rescinded.\" Andy says <br/>\"It would impact on the cafes, the restaurants, the B&B's\u2026 people want to come to a clean place to enjoy themselves.\"<br/>The River Umber is the main culprit, according to Mr Bell. It reaches the sea through a corridor of lush green algae on the edge of the beach. The Umber is usually little more than a stream but it receives discharges both from a sewage treatment plant and agricultural runoff from farms. <br/>Cleaning up the Umber is seen as a first step towards improving the water quality on the beach and the key to that, according to the artificial intelligence project, is a huge amount of real-time information.  <br/>A couple of kilometres upstream from Combe Martin beach, a floating water sensor is being installed in the river. It's a square black box with solar panels on top and is moored by a cable to the bank. <br/>It automatically transmits a stream of data on six key indicators of water health including acidity (pH), ammonia, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and how clear the water is (turbidity).<br/>\"It's a really good overview of water quality,\" said Glyn Cotton, the chief executive of environment-focussed technology company Watr, which is supplying the \u00a32,000-a-go ($2,557) sensors to the project. <br/>\"If sewage was being discharged upstream we would see spikes in things like ammonia and pH and we can then cross-reference that with temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.\"<br/>About 50 connected sensors are being used across the catchment area, a mix of water, soil and rain gauges. Mapping company Ordnance Survey are providing the expertise to integrate that information with location specific data and satellite imagery. <br/>\"We can start training the model using data to get it understanding that when there was a pollution event - whether it was associated with a particular area?\" said Donna Lyndsay from Ordnance Survey. \"Was there for example a particular rainfall event that washed it all off?\"<br/>The hope is that the AI might, for example, advise a farmer to stop putting more fertiliser on his field, if the soil is dry and heavy rain forecast because of the likelihood of it being washed into the waterways. <br/>Preventing raw sewage being discharged by water treatment plants - a practice allowed when heavy rainfall overwhelms facilities -  is more complicated. The AI might see it coming after heavy rainfall but that doesn't mean the water company has the capacity to stopped it being released. <br/>The first phase of the AI project was a desk-based model using historic data, with CGI saying it predicted pollution events with 91.5% accuracy. Now the AI model is being unleashed 'in the wild' and the question is whether it can do the same.<br/>\"We're starting very small here (in North Devon) \u2026 but the idea is very much to scale up and roll this out to different parts of the UK.\" said CGI's Mattie Yeta. <br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is developing fast, and transforming many aspects of life.

Experts say it will likely make 2024 the world's hottest year. <br/>They fear it will help push the world past a key 1.5C warming milestone.<br/>It will also affect world weather, potentially bringing drought to Australia, more rain to the southern US, and weakening India's monsoon.<br/>The event will likely last until next spring, after which its impacts will recede.<br/>For months, researchers have been increasingly confident that an El Ni\u00f1o event was set to emerge in the Pacific Ocean. <br/>\"It's ramping up now, there have been signs in our predictions for several months, but it's really looking like it will peak at the end of this year in terms of its intensity,\" said Adam Scaife, head of long-range predictions at the UK Met Office.<br/>\"A new record for global temperature next year is definitely plausible. It depends how big the El Ni\u00f1o turns out to be - a big El Ni\u00f1o at the end of this year, gives a high chance that we will have a new record, global temperature in 2024.\"<br/>This natural phenomenon is the most powerful fluctuation in the climate system anywhere on Earth.<br/>The El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, as it is properly called, has three different phases: Hot, cold or neutral. <br/>The hot phase, called El Ni\u00f1o, occurs every two to seven years and sees warm waters come to the surface off the coast of South America and spread across the ocean pushing significant amounts of heat up into the atmosphere.<br/>Record warm years, including 2016, the world's hottest on record, usually happen the year after a powerful El Ni\u00f1o event.<br/>Weather agencies around the world use different criteria to decide when this hot phase is upon us. <br/>For scientists in the US, their definition requires the ocean to be 0.5C hotter than normal for a month, the atmosphere must be seen to be responding to this heat and there must be evidence the event is persisting.<br/>These conditions were met in the month of May. In a statement, US National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said that \"El Ni\u00f1o conditions are present\".<br/>\"This is a very weak signal. But we believe that we're starting to see these conditions and that they will continue to intensify,\" said Michelle L'Heureux, a scientist with NOAA.<br/>\"Our weekly value is actually 0.8C this past week, which is even stronger.\"<br/>The researchers believe this event has an 84% chance of exceeding moderate strength by the end of this year. <br/>They also say there's a one in four chance of this event exceeding 2C at its peak, which is getting into the territory of a \"super El Ni\u00f1o\".<br/>The impacts of the onset of El Ni\u00f1o will likely lag behind by a few months but will be felt all over the world. <br/>Researchers expect these will include drier weather conditions in Australia and parts of Asia, with potential weakening of the monsoon in India. Southern US states will likely be wetter in the coming winter. El Ni\u00f1o normally strengthens drought conditions in Africa.<br/>If experience is anything to go by, there will be a large human and economic cost to this oncoming weather event. <br/>The strong El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98 cost over $5 trillion with around 23,000 deaths from storms and floods.<br/>There's also a strong likelihood that this year's version will push 2024 past 2016 as the world's hottest year.<br/>Global temperatures are currently hovering around 1.1C above the average in the period from 1850-1900.<br/>But an El Ni\u00f1o event could add up to 0.2C to that figure, pushing the world into uncharted temperature territory, and close to breaking the symbolic 1.5C guard rail, a key element of the Paris climate agreement.  <br/>Researchers recently said that breaking this limit temporarily was more likely than not in the next few years.<br/>\"We're actually likely to see global mean temperatures that might become more of a regular thing in five to ten year's time, so it does give us that sort of portal on the future.\" said Michelle L'Heureux.<br/>\"And I think that's why it's alarming to some people, because these are our new thresholds. And El Ni\u00f1o is providing an accelerant on that.\"<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It takes years, if not decades, for that to come back again,\" explained trustee Howard Inns.  <br/>For countryside ranger Darren Hill, who supported firefighters tackling the blaze here, seeing the aftermath, and knowing more wildfires could be on their way, is hard to take.  <br/>\"To come back and see a site like this, and know I found this species over here and we had smooth snakes over there, it does take its toll,\" he said.<br/>Meanwhile, using a drone with thermal imaging to survey the site for hidden subterranean burns is Matt Oakley, a fire investigations officer for Surrey Fire and Rescue.<br/>He is one of the UK's national wildfire tactical advisors - a group of specialist officers who already have the skills learnt abroad and who will be training units.<br/>He says the kind of techniques he's seen used in hotspots as far-flung as France and South Africa will be vital in the UK in the years to come. <br/>\"Our climate is changing - it's changing beyond recognition,\" he explained. \"What used to be a nine to 12-year cycle, this is every year now. <br/>\"We are heading towards a northern Mediterranean climate in the southeast of England within the next decade and this will be business as usual day in, day out.\"<br/>Many of the wildfire-fighting methods being rolled out across the UK rely on a 'toolbox' of skills, from creating natural firebreaks and reducing the 'fuel-load' of vegetation to setting controlled burns deliberately around wildfires to stop their spread. <br/>Together they would reduce the need for huge amounts of water in a drought and reduce the number of appliances needed on site.<br/>But the Fire Brigades Union says new training and techniques are not enough to tackle the rising challenges of climate change. It says more crews are needed after years of cuts that have seen the loss of thousands of firefighters since 2010.<br/>Matt Wrack, the Fire Brigades Union's general secretary, called for more funding from the government, saying: \"Rising temperatures and the systematic underfunding of the fire and rescue service are a recipe for destruction.\"<br/>The government said it was giving fire and rescue authorities around \u00a32.6bn this year, and each authority was able to decide what it spent it on.<br/>A spokesperson said: \"The Home Office works closely with the National Fire Chiefs Council and England and Wales Wildfire Forum to continue to improve our response to wildfires and mitigate them.\"<br/>Warning of 'very high' wildfire risk for Scotland<br/>Caution urged over countryside fire risks<br/>Fire service warning over disposable barbecues<br/>Highland wildfire could be largest ever in UK<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It's a hard volcanic rock that is neither rare nor particularly remarkable. <br/>But through a process known as 'enhanced rock weathering' it could help to cool our overheating planet.<br/>UN scientists are now clear that reducing greenhouse gas emissions alone won't be enough to stop dangerous levels of warming. They say there will need to be some carbon dioxide removal - actively taking it out of the atmosphere. <br/>Planting trees is the most natural way of doing this but has its limitations; the CO2 that's captured is released when the wood rots or burns and there are limits to how widely trees can be planted. <br/>Direct Air Capture (DAC), meanwhile, mechanically sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it underground; it's permanent - but does it make sense to build such an energy intensive process when we're trying to wean ourselves off fossil fuels? <br/>Enhanced rock weathering lies somewhere in between the natural and the man-made. It takes the naturally occurring but very gradual weathering process and turbo-charges it to remove the carbon faster. <br/>I've come to a quarry just across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh to see Jim, whose enhanced rock weathering company UNDO has just secured \u00a312m of new investment and is looking to scale up operations. <br/>Around us the black hillside is being steadily eaten away, scraped by enormous diggers to make concrete and asphalt for roads. The vibe is more post-nuclear apocalypse than saving the planet.<br/>But the tiny pieces of basalt rock that are left over are prized by Jim's company. They have a useful property - when they weather in the rain they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.<br/>For millennia volcanic rocks and cliffs have been removing carbon slowly while weathering in the rain. Enhanced rock weathering uses tiny pieces to increase the amount of contact between the rain and rock and hence the amount of weathering and carbon removal. <br/>As a cliff, or piled up in the quarry, the basalt weathers very slowly. To maximise the carbon removal it needs to be spread across a greater area.<br/>And that's where local farmers come in, helping the planet while getting free fertilizer in return. As well as locking away carbon, the basalt has been shown in trials to improve both crop yields and the quality of grazing. <br/>Half an hour's drive from the quarry I watch it being scattered on a field. <br/>It requires no specialist equipment. A trailer is loaded with 20 tonnes of basalt before a tractor drags it up and down, a rotating wheel at the back scattering the tiny rocks. <br/>\"It's free of charge which is quite important to a farmer,\" John Logan tells me with a chuckle as the basalt is put on his field. He'd seen UNDO's trials on a neighbouring farm. <br/>\"It looks like it's going to make the grass better, so that can only be good for the cattle because they're eating better grass.\"<br/>Some experts worry that carbon removal techniques like this might distract people from the more urgent priority of cutting emissions and even be used as justification to continue living our carbon intensive lives.<br/>\"CO2 reduction has to come first,\" Jim tells me as we watch the tractor move up and down guided by GPS, \"but we also need to be developing these technologies that can do removal at scale. And the nice thing about what we're doing with enhanced rock weathering is it's permanent.\"<br/>The maths, it must be said, are daunting. UNDO's scientists calculate that four tonnes of basalt rocks are needed to capture one tonne of CO2. <br/>With a typical Brit's CO2 emissions estimated at about 7 tonnes a year that means each of us needs about thirty tonnes, or one and half trailer loads of basalt to be scattered annually just to break even. <br/>UNDO has plans to rapidly scale up over the next few years and has attracted some serious supporters. Microsoft has agreed to pay for 25,000 tonnes of basalt to be scattered on UK fields. As part of the deal Microsoft will also help audit the project and verify that it is working as intended. <br/>\"The essential chemistry of it makes sense,\" Dr Steve Smith, an expert in carbon removal from Oxford University, told me.   <br/>\"Measuring how much CO2 would be taken out and where that ultimately goes, is one of the key challenges, and there's no standardized system at the moment.\"<br/>Ultimately Dr Smith thinks the idea could end up just a standard part of the way land is farmed. <br/>\"It's something that can be folded into the way we use land at the moment and deliver a carbon removal benefit alongside other benefits in terms of the way we use land for food and crops,\" he says.  <br/>There are still many questions about just how scaleable it is. UNDO's projects uses by-product from the local quarry - but if this is massively expanded the energy and emissions it takes both to grind up the basalt and then transport and scatter it will need to be factored in.  <br/>\"At this point in time, there's no downside, It's a win win for everybody involved.\" Jim Mann tells me. <br/>This year UNDO is planning to spread 185,000 tonnes of basalt and hopes by 2025 to have removed a million tonnes of CO2. It's still a drop in the ocean compared to emissions. In 2022 its thought the world discharged about 37 billion  tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Countries agreed to \"pursue efforts\" to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C under the 2015 Paris agreement.<br/>Going over 1.5C every year for a decade or two would see far greater impacts of warming, such as longer heatwaves, more intense storms and wildfires. <br/>But passing the level in one of the next few years would not mean that the Paris limit had been broken. Scientists say there is still time to restrict global warming by cutting emissions sharply.<br/>Since 2020 the World Meteorological Organisation has been giving an estimate of the chances of the world breaking the 1.5C threshold in any one year. <br/>Back then they predicted there was less than a 20% chance of breaking 1.5C in the five years ahead. <br/>By last year this had increased to 50%, and now it's jumped to 66%, which the scientists say means it's \"more likely than not.\"<br/>The figure is not a direct measure of the world's temperature but an indicator of how much or how little the Earth has warmed or cooled compared to the long term global average. <br/>Scientists use average temperature data from the period between 1850-1900 as a measure of how hot the world was before our modern reliance on coal, oil and gas. <br/>For decades they believed that if the world warmed by around 2C that would be the threshold of dangerous impacts - but in 2018 they significantly revised this estimate, showing that going past 1.5C would be calamitous for the world. <br/>Over the past few decades our overheating world has nudged the mercury up so that in 2016, the warmest on record, global temperatures were 1.28C above the pre-industrial figure. <br/>Now researchers say that figure is set to be smashed - they are 98% certain the high mark will be broken before 2027.<br/>And in the years between now and then they believe there's a very solid chance the 1.5C limit will be surpassed for the first time. <br/>\"We really are now within reach of a temporary exceedance of 1.5C for the annual mean temperature, and that's the first time in human history we've been that close,\" said Prof Adam Scaife, head of long range forecasts at the Met Office, who compile the data from weather and climate agencies around the world.<br/>\"I think that's perhaps the most stark and obvious and simplest statistic that we've got in the report,\" he told a news conference. <br/>The researchers stress that temperatures would have to stay at or above 1.5C for 20 years to be able to say the Paris agreement threshold had been passed. <br/>\"This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,\" said WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas<br/>\"However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency,\" he said.<br/>There are two key elements - the first is the continuing high levels of carbon emissions from human activities that despite a fall during the pandemic are still going up. <br/>The second, critical part is the likely appearance of El Ni\u00f1o, a weather phenomenon with global implications. <br/>For the last three years the world has been experiencing a La Ni\u00f1a event which has dampened climate warming to some extent. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>El Ni\u00f1o: How does it affect global weather?<br/>But the extra heat that El Ni\u00f1o will bring to the surface of the Pacific will likely push the global temperature to a new high next year.<br/>However there is still uncertainty around the onset and scale of the event.<br/>\"It's worth noting that a lot of our forecasts that are being made now for the El Ni\u00f1o that we think is developing this winter, are showing pretty big amplitude,\" Prof Scaife told reporters. <br/>\"But to actually predict the magnitude, or a subsequent event within the five-year period, we can't give the exact dates of that beyond this one year ahead, so it could be in three or four years from now we get to two and a half degree El Ni\u00f1o and that might be the one that does it. \"<br/>The Arctic will experience warming at a greater level than many regions, with the temperature anomaly expected to be three times as large as the global figure over the next five northern hemisphere winters. <br/>Northern Europe including the UK will likely experience increased rainfall for the May to September period over the next five years, the report says.<br/>Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.<br/>Unexplained ocean warming alarms scientists<br/>Wind is main source of electricity for first time<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Higher temperatures and rising sea levels will impact the youngest alive today far more than older generations. But the power to act is often still in the hands of older people, including parents.<br/>Big changes are difficult, especially when they involve other people. Where do you begin? For this year's Earth Day, we spoke to people who have successfully had tricky climate chats at home. Here are their top tips:<br/>Eating less meat is one of the best ways to reduce our impact on the planet, say scientists. <br/>Ilse, 17, lives in Brighton with her parents Antonia and Sally. They used to eat meat two or even three times a day. When Ilse was 13 she decided to do more about climate change and read that cutting out meat was a good start. <br/>Sally and Antonia were sceptical at first, worried about not getting enough protein or that Ilse was too young to make that decision.<br/>\"I was thinking, you're not doing the cooking. It's a big hassle for us,\" says Antonia, saying she worried about how to cook \"nice\" Chinese vegetarian meals. After a one-day-a-week trial, they quickly scaled up and after a year were totally meat-free. <br/>\"It was daunting at the beginning, but now it's really good. There's a million recipes out there,\" Antonia adds. Ilse jumps in to say her favourite now is vegetarian fajitas, and they cook a lot of roast vegetables or lasagne. <br/>Sally says that seeing the emotional impact of the topic on her daughter helped to persuade her it was the right thing for her family. \"It's actually seeing her really stick to that commitment, even though we knew that she liked the taste of meat. That made me stop and think,\" she explains. <br/>Ilse is part of Teach the Parent, a national campaign that encourages these conversations between generations. It was started by young people frustrated with the lack of international climate action and their feelings of powerlessness, says Melanie Kee from Students Organising for Sustainability UK who helps to run the project.<br/>Even if the first conversation goes badly, Ilse says keep going. \"Big lifestyle changes take time. If you bring it up every so often, it shapes people's attitudes in the long term.\"<br/>How we travel is a major source of carbon emissions, but switching from driving or flying can potentially limit family holidays and cost more.<br/>Phoebe L Hanson, a 21-year-old student from Stafford, persuaded her family to go to Cornwall instead of flying abroad. Facts are important but she advises focussing on the reasons why you care. <br/>\"Say something like, 'I'm really scared about my future, these are the reasons I want to do something',\" she suggests.  Her mum Tracy explains that as Phoebe got older, their relationship changed from Tracy explaining facts to her to meeting in the middle to share knowledge.<br/>Present a solution, not just a problem, Phoebe explains. \"Give them options for something fun or exciting.\" <br/>\"Saying 'let's do this thing instead' is really good way to communicate,\" she suggests.  <br/>She also says one answer to concerns about money is to discuss what type of world parents want children to inherit. \"People talk about how expensive trains are, but think about what the carbon emissions from taking a plane mean in the long term for us,\" she says.<br/>Radically reducing what we buy and throw away can improve our carbon footprint, but it can be time-consuming and difficult.<br/>Becky Little, who is 20 and a community carer in Worcester, persuaded her parents Rob and Ellen to reduce food waste and think more carefully about what they buy.<br/>\"Be well-informed about the things you want your family to start changing so they can see you care and have done some research,\" she says.<br/>Her parents were concerned about convenience but she focussed on the positive impacts. \"Explain why it will make their lives easier or cheaper,\" she suggests.<br/>\"Make connections with things they care about,\" she advises. Her family like to volunteer so they made meals using leftover food to donate to people in their local community.<br/>\"It's important to not go into it expecting them to change their whole lives. Small things can make a difference,\" she explains.<br/>Ilse, Phoebe and Becky all say that the conversations can be challenging at times but worth it. \"Taking action as an individual mean I've managed to feel a lot more in control of my future,\" Phoebe explains. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It's an important summary of six key pieces of research completed over the past five years. Our environment correspondent Matt McGrath considers the critical messages.<br/>The sober tones of this study by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make clear that there is very little chance of keeping the world from warming by more than 1.5C. Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid that. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s, despite all the political speechmaking.<br/>\"It has always been clear in the IPCC and in climate science, that it's not very likely that we always will stay below 1.5C,\" said Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team.<br/>Dr Geden and his colleagues now argue that coming back down as quickly as possible after overshooting this mark is where the focus should be. <br/>Overshooting is risky, as the report acknowledges, because it might trip tipping points that can't be uncrossed, such as the melting of permafrost that would in turn release vast amounts of warming gases.  <br/>Coming back from overshooting will need expensive, unproven technology to pull CO2 from the air, something known as carbon capture.<br/>It also means that it's even more urgent to get as quickly as possible to net zero - where the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere does not increase. Every increment of global warming and every year that goes by really matters. <br/>While the report doesn't definitively say it, there are some clear indications that there's no future for coal, oil and gas on a liveable planet.<br/>It highlights how renewable forms of energy such as wind and solar are now cheaper and that sticking with fossil fuels may be more expensive in many places than switching to low carbon systems.<br/>\"The message in terms of urgency, I think, is stop burning fossil fuels as fast as humanly possible,\" Dr Friederike Otto, one of the report's authors told BBC News.<br/>\"It is not because we are lacking some important piece of technology or some important knowledge. It is because so far, the sense of urgency has been lacking in the places where the important decisions are made.\"<br/>While it is easy to think that scientific reports on climate change are all about governments and energy policy, the IPCC has been moving to highlight the fact that the actions that people can take make by themselves make massive difference to the overall picture. <br/>\"We could cut 40 to 70% of projected 2050 emissions with end-use measures,\" said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace, who was an observer at the IPCC approval session.<br/>This includes shifting to plant-based diets, avoiding flights, building more walkable and bikeable cities,\" she told BBC News. <br/>The report nudges governments towards reforming their transport, industry and energy systems so that making these low carbon choices becomes much easier and cheaper for individuals.<br/>It's amazing to think that the decisions we make around the world over the next seven years will echo down the centuries.<br/>The report warns that with sustained warming of between 2 and 3C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost \"almost completely and irreversibly\" over multiple millenia.<br/>Many other thresholds will be crossed at low levels of heating, impacting things like the world's glaciers. <br/>To stop this runaway train of warming, governments need to up their commitments before 2030, to reach net zero by 2050, in order to keep warming in or around 1.5C by 2100. <br/>\"I think our climate system, but also our social systems and our ecosystems, all show us that it's bloody urgent, so that we can still change the world to make it a better place for all of us,\" said Dr Otto.<br/>The real strength of the IPCC is that their reports are agreed with governments - and as such the reports are approved by their representatives in the presence of the scientists who research and write them.<br/>But the future of fossil fuels is becoming more and more a political question. <br/>Last November in Sharm el-Sheikh, a number of countries tried but failed to get the UN to agree to phase out oil and gas as well as coal. <br/>This argument is not going away - with the EU now openly supporting such a move.<br/>This new IPCC report will be central to it when countries meet again at COP28 in Dubai later this year. <br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

These targets are supposed to rapidly cut the greenhouse gas emissions that warm our planet's atmosphere.<br/>\"There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all,\" the report states.<br/>Governments had previously agreed to act to avoid global temperature rise going above 1.5C. But the world has already warmed by 1.1C and now experts say that it is likely to breach 1.5C in the 2030s.<br/>The UK government responded that the report makes it clear that countries must \"work towards far more ambitious climate commitments\" ahead of the UN climate summit COP28 in November.<br/>\"The UK is a world leader in working towards net zero, but we need to go further and faster,\" a spokesperson said. <br/>Small islands in the Pacific are some of the countries expected to be worst hit by climate change. <br/>Responding to the report, the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru said: \"While our people are being displaced from their homes and climate commitments go unmet, the fossil fuel industry is enjoying billions in profits. There can be no excuses for this continued lack of action.\" <br/>The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the scientific body that advises the UN on rising temperatures - is agreed on by all governments involved.<br/>Their new study aims to boil down to one slim volume several landmark findings on the causes, impacts and solutions to climate change that have been released since 2018. <br/>It outlines the significant impacts that climate change is having on the world already, and explains that these will get much worse. <br/>By 2100 extreme coastal flooding that used to happen once-a-century is expected to occur at least annually in half of the world's tidal gauge locations - places where sea level recordings are made.<br/>Concentrations of the warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere are at their highest in 2 million years. The world is now warmer than at any time in the past 125,000 years - and will likely get warmer still over the next decade. <br/>\"Even in the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5C even under the very low greenhouse gas scenario,\" the report states.<br/>\"If we aim for 1.5C and achieve 1.6C, that is still much much better than saying, it's too late, and we are doomed and I'm not even trying,\" Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College, a member of the core writing team for this report, told BBC News.<br/>\"And I think what this report shows very, very clearly is there is so much to win by trying.\"<br/>The synthesis shows that projected emissions of CO2 from existing fossil fuel infrastructure, such as oil wells and gas pipelines, would bust the remaining carbon budget - the amount of CO2 that can still be emitted - for staying under this key temperature threshold. <br/>And while not explicitly mentioning new projects like Willow oil in the US or the Cumbria coal mine in the UK, the scientists involved have few doubts about their impact. <br/>\"There's not a cut-off day (for fossil fuels), but it's clear that the fossil fuel infrastructure we already have will blow through that carbon budget,\" Dr Oliver Geden, from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs and a member of the report's core writing team, told BBC News.<br/>\"The remaining carbon budget in opening new fossil fuel infrastructure is certainly not compatible with the 1.5C target.\"<br/>The document argues strongly that going past 1.5C will not be the end of the world as this may only be a \"temporary overshoot\". <br/>The authors say that they are optimistic that dramatic changes can be achieved rapidly, pointing to the massive falls in the price of energy made from solar and wind. <br/>They also argue that changes driven by consumers in terms of diet, food waste and switching to low carbon transport can achieve significant cuts in emissions from many sectors. <br/>But the report also acknowledges that in addition to getting to net zero emissions as soon as possible, large scale use of carbon dioxide removal technology will be needed.<br/>Some observers have their doubts. \"We know what needs to happen, but the carbon removal part and carbon capture and storage ideas are a massive distraction,\" said Lili Fuhr, from the Centre for International Environmental Law, who attended the approval session.<br/>Responding to the report's call for more urgent action, the UN secretary general is calling for countries to bring forward their plans for net zero by a decade. <br/>\"Leaders of developed countries must commit to reaching net zero as close as possible to 2040, the limit they should all aim to respect,\" he said in a statement. He also calls on the likes of India and China who have announced net zero plans for beyond 2050 to try and bring them forward by a decade as well.<br/>Father and son among Titanic sub missing as search continues<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The boss of Leeds and Reading Festivals has previously said he was concerned it could give people false confidence.<br/>Meg is a DJ who's worked on welfare teams at festivals with on-site drug testing and events without it.<br/>\"I've had some experiences before where I've been looking after 16-year-old girls who've taken way more than they thought they had,\" she says.<br/>\"Or that pill that they've taken is not exactly what they thought it was going to be. <br/>\"And it's really scary.\"<br/>Meg says these situations are \"massively reduced\" when there's testing on-site because it means more information is available.<br/>\"And then we know how to deal with it,\" she says.<br/>If the substance has been tested on-site the welfare teams will know if it's extra-strong or isn't what the person thought it was.<br/>\"Because there's plenty of times where that could happen and it can cause serious harm to the person who's taking the drug,\" says Meg.<br/>BBC Newsbeat asked the Home Office to respond to Sacha Lord's suggestion it had u-turned on back-of-house testing.<br/>It said the need for a licence was \"long-established\". <br/>\"We have been clear that where parties providing drug testing services are undertaking activities with controlled drugs they need to apply for a Home Office licence,\" a spokesperson said.<br/>But Sacha says it's \"ridiculous\" to claim that nothing has changed, and the industry is considering taking legal action against the government.<br/>The Loop - which has provided most back-of-house testing at UK festivals - told Newsbeat it couldn't comment.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.<br/>Parklife operation saw 33 arrests, police say<br/>'Festival drugs tests could have saved Georgia'<br/>'First' drug testing at UK festival<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

I didn't know who I could trust,\" he said, adding that he started to treat friends with the same level of suspicion he had received from colleagues.<br/>Closing his cross examination, MGN barrister Richard Munden asked Mr Turner about his claim that he'd been labelled a \"mole\" by fellow Coronation Street actor Craig Charles.<br/>Mr Turner said he was \"mortified\" by the claim, adding: \"Being a mole and leaking is one of the worst things you could do in our business.\"<br/>Asked how long Mr Charles had been in the cast of the soap at the time of the alleged exchange, Mr Turner told the court he was \"very new\" and may have been there only nine to 10 months.<br/>When asked as a final question how he came to think he may have been a victim of phone hacking, over a decade, by journalists at MGN, Mr Turner said: \"It just seems to be a few coincidences, let's say.\"<br/>Mr Turner said he only became aware he may have a claim against MGN in May 2020, when Ms Dynevor called him and alerted him to it.

This person had just come down from one of the chairman's lunches. My colleague started by saying, 'you'll never guess what Piers just said at Victor's lunch',\" Mr Seymour told the court.<br/>\"They then told me that Piers Morgan had mocked/taunted Ben Verwaayen, the CEO of BT who was present, saying something like, 'you need to tell your customers to change the PIN numbers on their mobile phones from factory settings, because otherwise you can just get into their voicemail messages'.\"<br/>When asked in court by Andrew Green KC, who was defending MGN, that the \"thrust of your evidence is that Piers Morgan knew how to hack a phone\", Mr Seymour responded: \"He explained it!\"<br/>Further pressed on the unlikelihood that Mr Morgan would explain how to hack a phone if indeed he had done it or had the knowledge, Mr Seymour said: \"Piers Morgan was an extremely boastful person... he would've enjoyed\" telling BT's chief executive.<br/>Mr Morgan has not given evidence during the case.

These have included running five marathons in five days and cycling from Land's End to John O'Groats.<br/>The Yukon, which takes place in July, will see him kayak down the Yukon River from Whitehorse in Canada through the Arctic Circle to Dalton Highway Bridge in Alaska in the US. With only 10 days to complete the 1,000 mile race, 28 two-person crews will need to be able to survive in the wilderness - there are no support teams accompanying them, although their progress will be monitored. <br/>Ashley and his teammate, Gary Johnson - a personal trainer, hope to complete it in seven to eight days - which means they will need to cover 120-125 miles (193-201km) each day.<br/>\"That will involve 18 hours a day kayaking with one hour to change, pitch your tent and find a safe place to eat your food in case you're in wolf or grizzly bear territory,\" he says. \"Then five hours' sleep - if you can sleep - to start the day again.\"<br/>As well as the threat of bear and wolf attacks, challengers also face the risk of hypothermia if they fall into the turbulent waters. \"I'm willing to risk my life\", says Ashley.<br/>\"There's a lot of things that go against you out there,\" he says, \"especially as I'm going to be the least-experienced person by miles to have ever attempted it. I've only been kayaking since February.\"<br/>Known for his speed and power, Ashley says these long distance challenges that involve endurance don't suit him.<br/>He explains: \"I'm big, I'm stocky, it goes against me, but in hospital [with Azaylia] I realised that life is a battle of endurance.\" <br/>To make it through, all you can focus on is your next step he says - and in every challenge, Azaylia is the reason he keeps taking that next step.<br/>\"When I'm struggling, I look up to her and she gives me the strength that I need,\" he says.<br/>Ashley has written a memoir, which will be published on 22 June, about the relationship with his daughter, her fight for life and the struggles he has faced since she died.<br/>\"After Azaylia passed away and I spoke her eulogy, I found myself spiralling a little bit into alcohol,\" he says.<br/>\"When I woke up one morning, I was in tears because I felt ashamed, I felt embarrassed. I thought, 'If this is the person that my daughter's looking down on, I need to hang my head.'\"<br/>He says he could lie to his parents about whether he had drunk alcohol, but he could not lie to himself or Azaylia.<br/>\"That's when I knew I needed to be changed\u2026 I needed to keep the promises that I'm making, not only to me, but to her.\"<br/>With his ex-partner, Safiyya Vorajee, and the foundation they created in their daughter's name, Ashley is determined to fundraise and increase awareness of childhood cancer. He says it is an area of research that is severely underfunded.<br/>\"If there is no new research, it means there are no new cures, if there are no new cures, it means there are no better statistics,\" he says.<br/>No child should have to go through what his daughter experienced, Ashley says, adding she taught him how to be brave when life was frightening.<br/>The TV star says his Christian faith was tested throughout her illness, but he refuses to let Azaylia's short life be in vain.<br/>\"There has to be a reason why what happened, happened, and I'm not going to be that person that turns to stone as a result. I am going to be the hero of my story for her, for myself and for other people around me,\" he says.<br/>Working seven-day weeks and 18-hour days, Ashley describes his schedule as relentless. Currently single, he says it wouldn't be fair to start a new relationship because he is committed to the path he is on. For now, he also cannot see himself having another child.<br/>\"I find it hard to be able to imagine that I could love anyone or anything else as much as I love Azaylia,\" he explains.<br/>By pushing himself to the limits, Ashley says he is not running away from the pain of his loss, but running \"head on into it\". He wants to show others \"no matter how tough your struggle was, there is strength at the other side.\"<br/>He has chosen to go to the extremes, risking his life in challenges such as the Yukon 1000, because he wants to make the greatest impact for Azaylia.<br/>\"I will do something with that incredible and beautiful life and I will make her name live on for many more years.\"<br/>Strong, by Ashley Cain, is published on 22 June.<br/>If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this story, support and advice is available via the BBC Action Line.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

They were using it [only] for album updates and links to videos.\"<br/>Members of the band often used these conversations and live streams to open up about their own struggles and vulnerabilities, creating a connection with fans.<br/>\"BTS were right in there, just chatting. You could get replies so it really felt like there wasn't that wall that K-pop used to have.\"<br/>Taylor thinks that BTS' success has \"opened the door\" for other Korean artists and made the K-pop world global.<br/>Groups like Blackpink have played at Coachella and are due to play in London this summer, while Red Velvet have been booked for a European tour.<br/>\"This is something very few K-pop idols could do prior to BTS.\"<br/>Though the group isn't making music right now, fans such as Mel James, currently based in Seoul, have been going all out in the past week to celebrate the birthday.<br/>The 26-year-old English teacher says the scenes of purple in the city, representing the band's colour, is \"amazing to see\".<br/>\"There are shows everywhere and Banpo Bridge which is in over the Han River is purple with fountain shows.<br/>\"There are deals going on in supermarkets.

He will be dearly missed by all of us,\" Ellsberg's family said in a statement obtained by NPR.<br/>For decades, Ellsberg was a tireless critic of government overreach and military interventions. <br/>His opposition crystallised during the 1960s, when he advised the White House on nuclear strategy and assessed the Vietnam War for the Department of Defense.<br/>What Ellsberg learned during that period weighed heavily on his conscience. If only the public knew, he thought, political pressure to end the war might prove irresistible.<br/>The release of the Pentagon Papers - 7,000 government pages that exposed deceptions by multiple US presidents - was a product of that rationale. <br/>The papers contradicted the government's public statements on the war and the damning revelations they contained helped bring an end to the conflict and, ultimately, sowed the seeds of President Richard M Nixon's downfall.<br/>Ellsberg was \"the grandfather of whistleblowers\", the former chief editor of The Guardian newspaper, Alan Rusbridger, told the BBC.<br/>His intervention \"radically changed the public opinion in the Vietnam War\", Rusbridger said on Radio 4's World Tonight programme. The case against him set a precedent and \"no US government has ever tried to injunct a paper on grounds of national security since\", he said.<br/>The Pentagon Papers created a First Amendment clash between the Nixon administration and The New York Times, which first published stories based on the papers - cast by government officials as an act of espionage that compromised national security. The US Supreme Court ruled in favour of the freedom of the press.<br/>Ellsberg was charged in federal court in Los Angeles in 1971 with theft, espionage, conspiracy and other counts. <br/>But before the jury could reach a verdict the judge threw out the case citing serious government misconduct, including illegal wiretapping.<br/>The judge said that in the middle of the case he had been offered the job of FBI director by one of President Nixon's top aides.<br/>It also emerged that there had been a government-sanctioned burglary of Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office.<br/>Ellsberg was born in Chicago on 7 April 1931, and grew up in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. Before reaching the Pentagon, he was a Marine Corps veteran with a Harvard doctorate who had worked for the Defense and State departments.<br/>According to Rusbridger, recent whistleblowers such as Julian Assange and Edward Snowden were \"moulded by\" Ellsberg. <br/>He told the BBC that the Pentagon Papers case had prompted him to think \"who gets to define the national interest: is that the government of the day or people with a conscience like Daniel Ellsberg?\"<br/>Ellsberg continued his quest to hold the government accountable years after the Pentagon Papers leak. <br/>During an interview in December 2022, he told BBC Hardtalk that he was the secret \"back-up\" for the Wikileaks documents leak. <br/>In the Wikileaks case, Julian Assange's organisation published more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables, provided by a US Army intelligence analyst, in 2010.<br/>Ellsberg said he felt Mr Assange \"could rely on me to find some way to get it [the information] out\".<br/>In the wake of a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in February, in which doctors told Ellsberg he had three to six months to live, he spent recent months reflecting on the Pentagon Papers and whistleblowing more broadly. <br/>In a March 2023 email obtained by the Washington Post, Ellsberg wrote: \"When I copied the Pentagon Papers in 1969, I had every reason to think I would be spending the rest of my life behind bars. It was a fate I would gladly have accepted if it meant hastening the end of the Vietnam War, unlikely as that seemed.\"<br/>Politico released an interview with Ellsberg on 4 June and, within it, the publication asked him whether whistleblowing is worth the risk despite his view that it has not made the government any more honest.<br/>\"When we're facing a pretty ultimate catastrophe. When we're on the edge of blowing up the world over Crimea or Taiwan or Bakhmut,\" he replied.<br/>\"From the point of view of a civilization and the survival of eight or nine billion people, when everything is at stake, can it be worth even a small chance of having a small effect?\" he said. \"The answer is: Of course...

It means whatever you want it to mean.\"<br/>Padam Padam is the second song to be taken from the star's upcoming album Tension, which is due for release in September.<br/>After the disco vibes of her last record, and the country-pop songs of 2018's Golden, she said the musical reference point for her new material was her slow-burning and sensual 2003 single Slow.<br/>Coincidentally, that song was Kylie's last number one in the UK. <br/>But with streams of Padam Padam increasing week-on-week, the singer could return to the top five very soon.<br/>Elsewhere in the charts, One Direction star Niall Horan achieved his second number one album with The Show, closely followed by McFly, with their seventh studio album, Power To Play.<br/>Dave and Central Cee have the number one single for a second week with the laid-back summer jam, Sprinter.

Both Ms Gray and Labour have said they will abide by Acoba's recommendations. <br/>The committee has no powers to enforce its recommendations or to punish MPs - or former MPs - who have broken the rules, but it can issue public rebukes. <br/>Earlier, an Acoba spokeswoman told the BBC \"newspaper columns are not considered significantly problematic\", but Mr Johnson was still meant to seek its advice. <br/>Mr Johnson's first column details his experience with the anti-obesity medication Ozempic, which he used to try and control his weight.<br/>\"It's a cinch, said the doctor,\" he wrote. \"All you need to do is inject a tiny dose of clear Ozempic fluid into your abdomen, once a week, and hey presto \u2014 no more raiding the fridge at 11.30pm for the cheddar and chorizo washed down with half a bottle of wine.\"<br/>While the ex-PM hoped he was \"going to become an ex-glutton\" and \"start to resemble chiselled whippet\", things \"started to go wrong\" after a month of injections, which he puts down to \"constantly flying around the world and changing time zones\". <br/>\"For now I am back to exercise and willpower,\" he added. <br/>The Daily Mail Online Twitter account described Mr Johnson as \"one of the wittiest and most original writers in the business\". <br/>In a video shared by the paper, he said: \"I am thrilled to have been asked to contribute a column to the Daily Mail.<br/>\"It is going to be completely unexpurgated stuff.<br/>\"I may even have to cover politics, but I'll obviously try to do that as little as possible unless I absolutely have to.\"<br/>In his opening column, the former prime minister made good on that promise, steering clear of politics and the events of the past week altogether. <br/>Instead, he wrote of his experience trying a weight-loss drug which, he said, worked \"miraculously\" for one of his cabinet ministers, but not for him.<br/>\"I was going to search for the hero inside myself - the one that was three stone lighter. I was going to locate that svelte and dynamic version of Johnson, imprisoned for decades in pointless extra body weight, and I was going to set him free,\" wrote the former MP.<br/>He said he had to give up injecting the fluid into his stomach once a week \"because they were making me feel ill\", but still believed such drugs could be \"transformative\".  <br/>Mr Johnson has declared millions of pounds in earnings outside Parliament since leaving No 10 last September, most of it from making speeches. <br/>In February, the total was nearing \u00a35m.   <br/>Now that he has stood down as an MP, he will not have to declare his earnings in the register of members' interests.<br/>The committee previously found Mr Johnson broke the rules by taking up a \u00a3275,000 a year column with the Telegraph weeks after standing down as foreign secretary.<br/>It said it was \"unacceptable\" Mr Johnson had not sought its advice before signing the contract.<br/>His Telegraph column became an important platform for his opposition to then-Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plans, and for building support for his own leadership ambitions. He stopped writing it when he entered Downing Street in July 2019. <br/>His new role with the Mail could give him the chance to take public pot shots at Rishi Sunak, with whom he has recently clashed over his resignation honours list. <br/>Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Mail titles, was rumoured to have been nominated for a peerage by Mr Johnson, but was reportedly one of the names removed during the House of Lords vetting process. <br/>Meanwhile, Mr Johnson has asked his supporters not to vote against a report that found he deliberately misled Parliament over Partygate. <br/>Several of his allies, including Nadine Dorries, had said they would oppose the Privileges Committee's findings in a Commons vote on Monday.<br/>Its main recommendation is that Mr Johnson should be suspended from Parliament for 90 days, but he has already resigned as an MP.<br/>Johnson's Telegraph contract broke rules<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It makes the audience feel part of an uncomfortable conversation.<br/>\"There's a woman, she's sitting on the edge of the bed, she's got my face but it's not my mouth, she's [doing a sexual act]\u2026 the woman's skin is a lot more tanned than mine would be, and this woman has exactly my tattoo. <br/>\"She's looking at some text... an invitation to humiliate the person in the picture, which is me.\"<br/>In the text, Helen is described as \"My blonde GF\", short for girlfriend, which becomes the title of the documentary.<br/>Morris tells the BBC she wanted to explore the impact the images had on Helen, including terrifying, graphic recurring nightmares and paranoia.<br/>In the film, Helen says she often feels as if \"people on the street somehow knew about the pictures, and they knew this horrible secret about me, which suddenly felt like my horrible secret\".<br/>This isn't the first time she has spoken about this though, and there have been other documentaries on deepfake porn, so how is Morris's film different? <br/>\"My film doesn't pay any attention to the perpetrator - I'm not interested in the headspace of the person that did it,\" the director says. \"My main goal was I want you to walk alongside Helen in this story. <br/>\"You are with her at every stage - when I met her she was still processing it, and trying to work it out. So the only way to get you to really feel it, is if you're alongside her the whole time.<br/>\"What struck me when I met Helen was that you can sexually violate somebody without coming into any physical contact with them. <br/>\"That's the thing that motivated me.\" <br/>The trauma of being used for deepfake porn is very real. Prof Clare McGlynn at Durham University, an expert in image-based sexual abuse, tells the BBC: \"The impact can be life-shattering and devastating. <br/>\"Many victims describe a form of 'social rupture', where their lives are divided between 'before' and 'after' the abuse, and the abuse affecting every aspect of their lives, professional, personal, economic, health, well-being.\"<br/>Helen says in the film: \"I did feel as if those were real images, and it's hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen that with their own pictures, what is it really - they've done nothing to me. <br/>\"But they've planted all this stuff in my head, these pictures, I can't unsee any of the images. I can't even see the perfectly unaltered pictures in the same way either. <br/>\"I now look at that picture [an image of her in a dress] and if I saw it independently, I feel like it's a picture of an assault.\"<br/>Morris talks about the impact of the images on Helen. <br/>\"The most disturbing aspect is that I don't think you can separate image from memory very easily, like photographs. You know, if you look back, you don't know if you remembered the moment or you remember the photograph of it. <br/>\"So what's happened to Helen is these images, which are attached to memories, have been reappropriated, and almost planted these fake, so-called fake, memories in her mind. And you can't measure that trauma, really.<br/>\"It's like being psychologically attacked by this, it's to do with the emotional attachment to the original image.\"<br/>Professor Erika Rackley, from Kent Law School, tells the BBC that a few years ago she and some colleagues interviewed victim survivors of image-based sexual abuse.<br/>\"One of them commented in the context of deepfakes that the picture was 'still a picture of you \u2026 it's still abuse',\" she says.<br/>A 2019 report by Sensity AI, a company that monitors deepfakes, found that 96% were non-consensual sexual images and, of those, 99% were of women.  <br/>Prof McGlynn agrees, saying: \"Women are far more likely to face this abuse, and it is mainly men perpetrating it. <br/>\"Society does not have a good record of taking crimes against women seriously, and this is also the case with deepfake porn. Online abuse is too often minimised and trivialised.\" <br/>Helen also speaks in My Blonde GF about the unimaginable worry of not knowing who created the images.<br/>\"In every single one of those pictures it's my eyes staring at the camera,\" she says. \"But through it all, this person, this profile creator, this image hoarder has no face.\"<br/>She was even more horrified when she found that police were unable to do anything to prosecute whoever had made the images. <br/>They told her there was nothing they could do, as no crime had been committed. It is not illegal to make deepfake images. <br/>The law in Scotland already allows police to investigate it, but current law in England and Wales does not. <br/>The forthcoming Online Safety Bill, which is currently being scrutinised in the House of Lords, is going to make sharing non-consensual deepfake porn images illegal. <br/>Prof McGlynn says the \"changes in the bill are long overdue,\" but for it to really be effective, \"it needs to name online violence against women and girls as a priority problem, and include measures to ensure internet platforms take these abuses seriously\". <br/>The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, which is responsible for the bill, advised the BBC it is expected to become law this year. <br/>Morris concludes that she is \"trying to ask questions\" with her film, adding: \"I don't have solutions, but I really feel it's something we need to pay attention to\".<br/>She says the importance of documentaries cannot be under-estimated, adding: \"I think they give you a window into other people's lives.<br/>\"I feel like now, because of social media, we're so into our own experience, and how we represent ourselves.<br/>\"It's so important to think about how other people live and experience the world.\"<br/>Sharing pornographic deepfakes to be illegal<br/>Deepfaked: \u2018They put my face on a porn video\u2019<br/>Deepfake pornography could become an 'epidemic'<br/>'Deepfake porn images still give me nightmares'<br/>Bella Thorne fighting back on deepfake pornography<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It was one day before the funeral.<br/>\"And there, in the sauna, my granny revealed my grandfather had actually betrayed her with another woman. <br/>\"She said how difficult it was... and she released all the emotions connected to that. It took hours. <br/>\"And then we went out - and there was peace.\"<br/>This is what we see over and over in the film, as the seasons change and the women keep returning to their \"safe space\".<br/>They talk about their relationships with their mothers, laugh about sex, and discuss how they feel about their bodies. <br/>One woman talks about the moment she came out as gay to her parents, while another expresses how it felt growing up in a culture that favoured boys.<br/>When something distressing comes up - there are some no holds-barred conversations about sexual assault and cancer - the women listen intently, absorbing all that is said.<br/>Emotions pour out, like the constantly flowing water of the sauna. <br/>The women sing and repeatedly chant their support: \"Take the pain away,\".<br/>Then we see them plunge afterwards into the icy pool dug into a frozen lake outside. <br/>It looks painful as they pad over the ice, naked except for socks, but they all look rejuvenated afterwards.<br/>\"All of us have stories inside,\" Hints says. \"As you sweat, first there is more [on the] surface and then there's dirt coming out - and it's the same with emotions.\"<br/>She talks about how \"all of us have those stories and deeper layers of experiences\".<br/>\"Something magical happens when you're there, naked in the darkness, with this community around you. And when you share something, nobody starts to teach. <br/>\"When you share, another listens, and that is a huge power. That is part of the healing itself.\"<br/>Hints also offers the audience at her film screening in Sheffield a new experience, just before it begins.<br/>She stands at the front and sings a traditional welcome, inviting us to join in: \"All your fears in cold water, All your shame in cold water, All your pain in cold water.\"<br/>This doesn't spark a huge singalong, but it does get a warm round of applause, and helps give an indication of the film to follow. <br/>Hints explains that in order to shoot the footage, the technical equipment had to be acclimatised.<br/>\"It's really a challenge,\" she explains.<br/>\"The average temperature was 80 degrees, and the average session lasts four hours, and then you go out and then you'll come back in.\"<br/>The camera lens had to be prepared in advance, by being put on the floor of the sauna two hours before filming started, to adjust to the heat.<br/>There was also a second lens outside, as the camera inside the sauna could not be used outdoors due to temperature difference.<br/>She says they had two lenses break during their seven years filming the documentary, which is perhaps not surprising.<br/>\"I had to, as director, not just hold the space in emotional terms, but also physically, checking that everyone is hydrated and we don't wait too long to go out,\" she adds. <br/>With the camera's focus so firmly on the women, Hints talks about how important it was for her how their bodies were filmed.<br/>She had a male cinematographer, and was at pains to avoid the film portraying the women in a sexualised way. <br/>\"So he's very sensitive, but in the beginning, when we were finding the language, there was a male gaze, and he was not aware of that,\" she says. <br/>\"It became a growth journey, of being aware that actually he is used to watching female bodies in a certain way. <br/>\"And then adjusting that, and starting to look beyond desire or judgement.\"<br/>Gayle Sequeira wrote in Film Companion that Hints achieved her goal, saying: \"The gaze isn't sexual, but empathetic. These bodies are the maps on which the history of these women's lives has been written.\" <br/>Variety's Jessica Kiang added that \"the small, smoky, steamy miracle of this film is how it creates something so intangible, so lyrical, from the absolutely elemental: Fire, wood, water and lots of naked female flesh\".<br/>Vox's Alissa Wilkinson called the film, which has a 100% rating on film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, a \"gorgeously captured space, carved out away from the world of men\".<br/>Hints ends by telling another anecdote, about a woman who learned to feel positive about her body having seen the film.<br/>\"She wrote to me afterwards that she booked a photographer,\" she says. <br/>\"She had been so angry about her body throughout her life, she hated her body.<br/>\"And now, enough. <br/>\"She's just gonna do some beautiful pictures and accept her body the way it is.<br/>\"That was so nice.\"<br/>Will the UK warm to Finland's naked sauna diplomacy?<br/>Estonians convert old car into sauna<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Sun cream: check. The next thing: what am I going to wear? <br/>With Glastonbury 2023 ready to start, festival season is well under way. <br/>The festival prides itself on being eco-conscious, but how do fans plan their outfits sustainably? <br/>Festival and concert fashion has become a huge part of event planning: a quick scroll on TikTok and you'll see cowboy hats and feather boas as the uniform for Beyonc\u00e9 and Harry Styles concerts.<br/>Jess Potter, 36, from Cardiff, will be going to Glastonbury with her online second-hand clothing business. <br/>At the festival she will be hosting the second-hand style awards, where festival-goers will be judged on their best sustainable looks from the weekend.<br/>Jess confesses she has not always been sustainable. During her first Glastonbury in 2014 she bought everything new, she used to be a \"retail addict\". That's where she met her now husband and business partner Davey, and they are now \"on a journey to sustainability together\".<br/>The idea for UsedandLoved.com - a search engine tool that allows you to search for second-hand items all under one roof - came from a sleepless night idea, said Jess. <br/>She said second-hand shopping was \"all about finding your own style\", and seeing content creators styling the outfits was key to changing people's attitudes on buying them.   <br/>In her spare time, Jess goes around Cardiff picking up bags of clothes that are left on the side of the road, which she sifts through and gives a new lease of life.<br/>\"I've found stuff from Ralph Lauren and Zara in them, all in really good condition,\" she said.<br/>She plans to put the clothes found on the streets of Cardiff on display at Glastonbury with the idea that \"they are free again and their destiny has been changed because they are going to get another life, and that clothes can live on for so long if you let them\".<br/>Bethany Lewis, from Swansea, planned her whole festival wardrobe via second hand shops and went on online clothes site Vinted for the In It Together festival in Margam, Neath Port Talbot. <br/>When she booked for In It Together, she was adamant she would not buy anything new.<br/>\"I've never done a festival in that kind of heat before so I kind of took all the  basics out of my wardrobe, so I mostly managed to use things I already owned,\" she said.<br/>\"But then, if I was looking for something specific, like I wanted like a mesh top to wear under an outfit so I went on Vinted, looking for stuff specifically.<br/>\"Rather than buying it new, I knew that I got it cheaper. I was also reducing my impact on the environment by buying it.\"<br/>Cost plays a part too, with tickets for festivals not cheap. <br/>A ticket to Glastonbury would set you back \u00a3335 this year - and that's without buying your camping essentials like tent, wellies and booze (if that's your thing) - so many people try to use second-hand sites to get their outfits. <br/>Caitlin Smith, a fashion blogger from Church Village, Rhondda Cynon Taf, who's based in London, said: \"I don't tend to buy anything that doesn't work with at least five pieces in my wardrobe. So, if I'm looking for a festival 'fit, I'll only buy items that I know I'll wear again.<br/>\"I blame being a Capricorn for my frugality, so I don't like feeling like I've wasted money on something I'll wear once.\"<br/>\"I also tend to look for accessories or builder pieces that I can layer over things I already own. Accessorising and layering are such fun and easy ways to change up your look without having to buy a completely 'new' outfit.\"<br/>Rachel Cosgrove-Pearce, the head of retail operations for Oxfam, said shopping second-hand was a great way to express individuality. <br/>\"For the festival season, a lot of the (Oxfam) shops will pull together festival-style windows to help people choose their outfits for going. They'll have festival displays inside and the beauty of shopping second-hand with Oxfam is that you can be your own stylist.\"<br/>\"You can go in, you shop in a variety of brands, you're not being influenced around the latest trends, and you can literally go and choose the pieces and create your own look unique for you. <br/>\"Everyone is more conscious than ever now about sustainability and by shopping with Oxfam not only are you going to look fabulous, and you know you're going to feel fabulous.\"<br/>So that's the fashion advice. But what to do about the weather?<br/>With Glastonbury predicted to be a scorcher, the advice is to try and pack for the heat - and if it does rain, trusty wellies and a raincoat will always be in style. <br/>Love Island could change second-hand buying habits<br/>'Everyone' has to face fashion's climate impact<br/>Rise in sales of second-hand party outfits<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Last year, it resisted calls to cut ties with its controversial star Joe Rogan, who reportedly received $200m in 2020 for giving the streamer exclusive listening rights.<br/>But Mr Rogan's show offers several multi-hour episodes each week, which reportedly command an average audience of 11 million people. <br/>Meghan by contrast delivered just 12 episodes of her Archetypes podcast last year.<br/>The joint statement announcing the split said the Sussexes and Spotify were \"proud\" of the material they made together. <br/>And a string of accolades showed why.<br/>Archetypes' debut last year hit the top of Spotify's charts in six markets, including the US and UK. The show, in which Meghan interviewed fellow celebrities such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling, also won a People's Choice Award.<br/>But crisis communications guru Mark Borkowski says the show may not have been compelling enough when Spotify reviewed the numbers.  <br/>\"It's always about the content.... clearly there hasn't been a big enough audience for it,\" he says. \"If you can't deliver your fee, no one's going to pay it.\"<br/>Mr Borkowski says there is little doubt that the duke and duchess still have value as a media brand. But it may not be what it once was. <br/>Polling for Newsweek earlier this year suggested the couple's popularity in the US suffered following the publicity blitz surrounding their Netflix documentary series and the publication of Harry's memoir, Spare. \"The more Prince Harry and Meghan say, the less Americans like them,\" was Newsweek's headline.<br/>Mr Borkowski says the pair, who stepped back as working royals in 2020, will have to \"think hard\" about what they can offer in whatever they do next.<br/>\"It's a thread that's been pulled out of the brand,\" he says of the Spotify break-up. \"If they want to stop it unravelling they've really got to think hard. The biggest question is are they going to learn from this setback or are they going to ignore it as just a blip.\"<br/>A spokesperson for the Hollywood talent agency now representing the duchess told the Wall Street Journal this week: \"Meghan is continuing to develop more content for the Archetypes audience on another platform.\"<br/>Max Willens, senior analyst at Insider Intelligence, says Spotify is not the only tech giant that spent heavily in recent years to sign talent who failed to live up to the promise implied by the money they commanded. <br/>Those heady days ended last year, as economic sentiment soured and share prices sank. <br/>But shares in Spotify, which continues to add users and has seen its catalogue of podcasts jump to more than five million, are up nearly 90% this year, as investors welcome Mr Ek's promises to stay focused on \"efficiency\". <br/>In announcing the \"next phase\" for its podcasting business this month, the company signalled it would embrace lower-cost, third party creators, while pushing investment towards \"always on\" programming. <br/>\"The platforms that have gotten into [podcasting] had to take some time to figure out what constituted a good investment,\" Mr Willens says. He calls the decision by Spotify and the duke and duchess to part ways an \"understandable and natural part of that that process\". <br/>\"Those were big, big deals designed to generate buzz and grab headlines and they accomplished that.

We can have amazing conversations. It's almost like a little book club,\" he says.<br/>A long-time scary movie fan, Sammy said it was a logical jump to streaming scary games.<br/>He started with first-person shooter Doom, and things have built up from there.<br/>\"At the beginning I was very much like 'most people aren't going to watch this.

Alisa would try to comfort her, making her oatmeal and talking her back to sleep.<br/>But her anxiety had deeper roots than the pandemic.<br/>All four Aces were brought up in Provo, a deeply religious town in the US state of Utah, about 45 minutes away from the headquarters of the Mormon church.<br/>\"If you're not familiar with Mormonism, it's just intense Christianity, really,\" says Cristal. \"But it's a way of life in Utah. It's the world you live in. We didn't know people that weren't Mormon in high school.\"<br/>The sisters, who were \"tomboys from the time we were little kids\", were \"constantly reminded we don't fit in,\" says Alisa. <br/>\"The culture is super homophobic, super patriarchal,\" agrees McKenna. \"There's a blueprint you're supposed to follow, as women especially, of getting married young, having a family, not having a career. <br/>\"Just for some context, Utah has the highest suicide rate among LGBTQ youth in the whole country. So it's a really big issue, how they isolate queer youth, especially.\"<br/>Cristal had her first crush on another girl in kindergarten but she squashed her feelings, believing they were sinful. She tried praying to be straight and dated boys in high school before coming out to her sister at the age of 18. <br/>Alisa didn't bat an eyelid before replying, \"Oh, same.\"<br/>As soon as they could, they disavowed Mormonism and fled Utah for Los Angeles. But though their bandmates supported them, they were still tied to the church.<br/>So when, in 2016. the sisters presented the band with a song called Loving Is Bible - a \"grand declaration\" that God is tolerant of all sexualities - it caused a certain amount of internal friction.<br/>\"That song almost didn't come out because it was really upsetting to Kenna and Katie,\" says Alisa.<br/>\"The church conditions you to be scared because your salvation is on the line,\" McKenna explains. \"I was really scared of what other people would think.\"<br/>Five years later, things have changed. Katie has also come out as queer and left the church. McKenna, the band's only straight member, also stepped away from Mormonism despite getting married in the LDS Temple in 2019.<br/>\"I really didn't have a good experience there [at the temple]. That was kind of the catalyst of me leaving.<br/>\"But my biggest issue was when the girls came out to me. I was like, 'This feels real and what the church is teaching doesn't. There's something wrong with the church.'\"<br/>I've Loved You For So Long is the first album The Aces have recorded where they're all on the same page. But it was only possible after the solitude of the pandemic forced them to confront their past.<br/>\"As sisters, it started clicking that we'd spent the last six years running away from our hometown and trying to not be associated with our upbringing,\" says Alisa. <br/>\"We were ashamed about it and embarrassed about it. It deeply affected our mental state and and it's still affecting us to this day.\"<br/>At first, Cristal was reluctant to share those feelings in her lyrics. <br/>\"I was like, 'I don't want to talk about that'. I want to go to studio and not talk about it because that's my whole existence, all the time, and it's miserable.\"<br/>The breakthrough came when they were working on, of all things, a sexually-charged pop song about lust at first sight. Originally called Don't Speak, Alisa texted her sister, suggesting she change the lyrics to \"don't freak\" and making it about her panic attacks.<br/>\"I was like, 'Wait, that's actually really cool',\" says the 27-year-old. \"And it opened up these big conversations about mental health and anxiety and identity.\"<br/>Don't Freak came out as a standalone single in 2021, but its confessional approach reverberates throughout The Aces' new album.<br/>\"Everything I love / I'm told I shouldn't touch / Cause good girls love Jesus / Not that girl from Phoenix,\" sings Cristal, reliving her childhood with justifiable anger on the punky Suburban Blues.<br/>I Always Get This Way was written as Cristal's mental health unravelled, addressing her guilt at \"falling apart\", and the way it affects her relationships.<br/>But the album ends with the gorgeously catchy jangle-pop of Younger, where the singer tells her 14-year-old self: \"I wouldn't change anything.\"<br/>\"When I was 14, I was in so much pain about my identity, about what my life was going to look like, but all I needed was someone to say 'You're okay and you're gonna figure it out',\" she says.<br/>United by their experiences, the band tear into their new songs with a fresh musical ferocity. <br/>The spiky guitars on Girls Make Me Wanna Die are a direct callback to their beginnings, playing Paramore covers in a neighbour's garage before they were even teenagers. Other tracks draw on The Cure and Depeche Mode, who they'd hear around the house growing up.<br/>Katie, the most reserved in conversation, is the band's musical backbone, playing funky, staccato guitar riffs on the poppy title track, and shimmering shoegazy lines on the more introspective Person.<br/>\"That's really what elevated our band, was when we added Katie,\" says McKenna. \"That's when everything got better.\"<br/>\"It's just so cool to watch her chase sounds, chase tones,\" agrees Cristal. \"She's such an amazing musician that we're always just like, 'Yeah, let's throw solo in there. She'll make the song better.'\"<br/>Unsure how to handle the praise, Katie whispers to herself: \"What is even happening?\"<br/>That camaraderie, that mutual love, is what makes The Aces unique. <br/>Most bands push their lead singer to the foreground, and Cristal could certainly dominate if she wanted to, but The Aces are a gang. <br/>At Maida Vale, they move as a pack, trading goofy jokes and dancing to their own songs, having previously forced their Uber driver to play the new album at full blast on the way over. (\"We'd better get a five-star passenger rating,\" laughs Cristal).<br/>\"It's scary to think where I'd be without this band,\" says Alisa.<br/>\"What brought us together was that intrinsic feeling of not belonging, and wanting to create something where we could hang out together and feel like we did belong.\"<br/>\"It's just been this incredible support system for our entire lives,\" agrees her sister. <br/>\"People ask us, 'How did you not break up?' and, to me, that's the craziest question because it didn't even feel like an option. <br/>\"It was just like, 'We are The Aces. We were born to do this.'\"<br/>The Aces: 'We were told not to sing about girls'<br/>The Aces: 'Not all girl bands are the same'<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

But Jackson was not easily flattered.<br/>Famously prickly, her view of Tinseltown often bordered on contempt. \"If I'm too strong for some people,\" she said, \"that's their problem\".<br/>And, at the height of her acting power, she gave it all up for a career in politics.<br/>Glenda May Jackson was born on 9 May 1936 in Birkenhead, in Wirral, the daughter of a bricklayer. <br/>She attended the local grammar school, leaving at 16 to work at Boots.<br/>Bored, she joined a YMCA drama group. \"I had no real ambition about acting,\" she later recalled.  \"But I knew there had to be something better than the bloody chemist's shop.\"<br/>Two years later, she won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA).<br/>It was, according to one reviewer, her \"intense, sexually-charged talent\" that won her a place at the prestigious academy.<br/>She made an impression while still at RADA, when she appeared in a production of Terence Rattigan's Separate Tables. <br/>She followed this up with the traditional actor's apprenticeship, doing six years in rep.  She also had a small role in the 1963 film, This Sporting Life.<br/>By this time she had married actor and art dealer Roy Hodges. The couple had a son, Dan, who is a noted political commentator. <br/>She joined the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1964. A year later, her big breakthrough came in Peter Brook's stage production of Marat/Sade.<br/>Jackson played the lunatic asylum inmate who finds herself acting the role of Charlotte Corday, the assassin of the French revolutionary, Jean Marat.<br/>David Edgar described her performance as that of a \"waif-like narcoleptic unable to control her behaviour, but also - completely believably - the differently-mad person playing Corday\".<br/>Jackson transferred with the production to Broadway and, in 1967, appeared in a film version - also directed by Brook.<br/>In 1969, she won her first Oscar, for best actress, in Ken Russell's adaptation of the DH Lawrence novel, Women in Love.<br/>The beautifully shot film became notorious for its nude scenes which, Jackson later recalled, she played with \"a prevailing sense of coldness\".  <br/>Her co-star Oliver Reed - hardly a shrinking violet himself - memorably described acting alongside her as like \"being run over by a Bedford truck\".<br/>The movie sparked Jackson's admiration for director Russell. Russell reciprocated, casting her in The Music Lovers, his biopic of Tchaikovsky.<br/>The film, which revolved around the relationship between the homosexual composer and his nymphomaniac wife - played by Jackson - was not a commercial success. <br/>But, according to one critic, the film was worth watching \"thanks largely to a powerhouse performance by Glenda Jackson, one actress who can hold her own against Russell's excess\".<br/>In 1971, having appeared as Elizabeth I in the historically dubious film, Mary, Queen of Scots, she reprised the role in BBC TV's Elizabeth R.<br/>The six-part series saw her play the Virgin Queen from princess to ailing old woman.  <br/>Jackson played the part with her customary intensity, even shaving her hair to accommodate the make-up required as her character aged.<br/>She was now firmly established as one of the world's foremost dramatic actresses.  She responded by sending herself up.<br/>One interviewer described her as \"so defiantly charmless that there is something oddly engaging about her, even vulnerable\".<br/>\"As for her sense of humour,\" they went on, \"it's by no means non-existent, but you often need long tweezers to find it.\"  But that did not mean she lacked comic timing.<br/>In 1971, she made her first appearance on the Morecambe and Wise Show - playing a comedy Cleopatra.  <br/>\"All men are fools,\" she declared with a flourish, \"and what makes them so is not having beauty like what I have got.\"  The audience loved it, and Hollywood took note.<br/>Soon she found herself cast opposite George Segal in a romantic comedy, A Touch of Class.  <br/>Jackson plays a British divorcee who has an affair with a married American, and falls in love. Her classy, understated performance won her a second Oscar.<br/>\"Stick with us,\" cabled Morecambe, \"and we will get you another one\". But - as with her previous Academy Award - she refused to go to Hollywood to pick up the statuette.  <br/>\"You don't do a play to compete for an award, \"she explained. \"I didn't win them. They were given to me.\"<br/>Jackson's marriage ended in 1976, after Jackson's husband sued for divorce on the grounds of adultery.  <br/>She did not deny it, but later noted that she had never been involved in a non-violent relationship.<br/>\"When I have to cry,\" she later said, \"I think about my love life. And when I have to laugh, I think about my love life.\"<br/>She returned to the RSC in the title role of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler, directed by Trevor Nunn.  She was Oscar-nominated for the subsequent film version, which Nunn also directed.<br/>She also received plaudits for her role in Howard Barker's play, Scenes from an Execution, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1984 - which subsequently transferred to the stage.<br/>Jackson wowed the critics on Broadway when she appeared in Eugene O'Neill's melodrama, Strange Interlude.  It required her to be on stage for four hours, as her character aged from a naive teenager to embittered mother. <br/>The New York Times was ecstatic: \"She's equally mesmerizing as a Zelda Fitzgerald-esque neurotic, a rotting and spiteful middle-aged matron and, finally, a spent, sphinx-like widow happily embracing extinction.\"<br/>She joined forces with Russell again in 1989, with an appearance in The Rainbow.<br/>At the age of 56, Jackson announced she was quitting acting - to stand as a Labour parliamentary candidate in the 1992 general election.<br/>\"The best theatre is trying to tell the truth,\" she said. \"And the best politics is trying to tell the truth.\"<br/>In an otherwise miserable election for her party, she won a notable victory in Hampstead and Highgate, which had been a Conservative seat for two decades.<br/>When Labour came to power in 1997, Jackson became a junior minister with responsibility for London Transport.<br/>She resigned two years later, to make a bid to become Labour's candidate for the London mayor, but was defeated by Frank Dobson.<br/>A left-winger by inclination, she became a fierce critic of Tony Blair's New Labour project and spoke out against the invasion of Iraq.<br/>In 2005, she threatened to stand against Blair for the party leadership unless he announced his intention to stand down.<br/>With boundary changes, Jackson clung on to her seat in the 2010 general election with a wafer-thin majority of 42.<br/>But the most controversial moment in her political career came in April 2013, when Parliament was recalled to pay tribute to the former prime minister, Margaret Thatcher.<br/>Lady Thatcher had just died. But Jackson saw no reason to rein in her criticism of a woman she believed \"had inflicted heinous social, economic and spiritual damage upon the country\".<br/>Conservative MPs were furious when the Speaker refused to rule her remarks out of order. One political commentator accused the Labour left of being \"petty\", \"childish\" and \"self-indulgent\" with its ungracious attacks on the Iron Lady's memory. The writer was Jackson's son, Dan Hodges.<br/>Jackson decided not to defend her seat at the 2015 general election. And - at the age of 79 - she returned to acting.<br/>She played the 104-year-old Adelaide Fouque in a BBC Radio 4 production entitled Emile Zola: Blood Sex and Money.  <br/>And, in 2016 - a full quarter of a century after last treading the boards - took on the role of King Lear at the Old Vic.  <br/>\"My fear,\" she said, \"was that I would not have the physical or vocal strength\" to play one of Shakespeare's most challenging parts.  <br/>But the Daily Telegraph described her performance as \"one of those 11th-hour feats of human endeavour that will surely be talked about for years to come\".<br/>Two years later, she won a Tony Award on Broadway in a revival of Edward Albee's Three Tall Women.<br/>Chain-smoking and often barbed, she tolerated no fools. \"No-one does scorn like Jackson,\" said one shell-shocked interviewer.  <br/>But the writer Marilyn Stasio best summed up the experience of watching her act:  \"It is like looking straight into the sun,\" she wrote in Variety magazine.  <br/>\"Her expressive face registers her thoughts while guarding her feelings. But it's the voice that really thrills. <br/>\"Deeply pitched and clarion clear, it's the commanding voice of stern authority.  Don't mess with this household god or she'll turn you to stone.\"<br/>Jackson was winning accolades for her acting work as recently as 2020, when she won a Bafta TV Award for best leading actress for her performance in Elizabeth is Missing, about a woman suffering from dementia.<br/>Shortly before her death, Jackson completed filming The Great Escaper, in which she co-starred with Michael Caine.<br/>Sir Michael Caine leads tributes to Glenda Jackson<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

It was one of several songs on a cassette labelled \"For Paul\" that Lennon had made shortly before his death in 1980. <br/>Lo-fi and embryonic, the tracks were largely recorded onto a boombox as the musician sat at a piano in his New York apartment.<br/>Cleaned up by producer Jeff Lynne, two of those songs - Free As A Bird and Real Love - were completed and released in 1995 and 96, marking the Beatles' first \"new\" material in 25 years.<br/>The band also attempted to record Now And Then, an apologetic love song that was fairly typical of Lennon's later career, but the session was quickly abandoned.<br/>\"It was one day - one afternoon, really - messing with it,\" Lynne recalled.<br/>\"The song had a chorus but is almost totally lacking in verses. We did the backing track, a rough go that we really didn't finish.\"<br/>Sir Paul later claimed George Harrison refused to work on the song, saying the sound quality of Lennon's vocal was \"rubbish\".<br/>\"It didn't have a very good title, it needed a bit of reworking, but it had a beautiful verse and it had John singing it,\" he told Q Magazine.<br/>\"[But] George didn't like it. The Beatles being a democracy, we didn't do it.\"<br/>There were also said to have been technical issues with the original recording, which featured a persistent \"buzz\" from the electricity circuits in Lennon's apartment.<br/>In 2009, a new version of the demo, without the background noise, was released on a bootleg CD. Fans have speculated that this recording may not have been available in 1995, suggesting it was stolen from his apartment, along with other personal effects, after his death.<br/>In the intervening years, Sir Paul has repeatedly talked about his desire to finish the song.<br/>\"That one's still lingering around,\" he told a BBC Four documentary on Jeff Lynne in 2012. \"So I'm going to nick in with Jeff and do it. Finish it, one of these days.\"<br/>It would seem that technology has now afforded the musician a chance to achieve that goal.<br/>The turning point came with Peter Jackson's Get Back documentary, where dialogue editor Emile de la Rey trained computers to recognise the Beatles' voices and separate them from background noises, and even their own instruments, to create \"clean\" audio.<br/>The same process allowed Sir Paul to \"duet\" with Lennon on his recent tour, and for new surround sound mixes of the Beatles' Revolver album to be created last year.<br/>\"He [Jackson] was able to extricate John's voice from a ropey little bit of cassette,\" Sir Paul told Radio 4's Martha Kearney. <br/>\"We had John's voice and a piano and he could separate them with AI. They tell the machine, 'That's the voice. This is a guitar. Lose the guitar'. <br/>\"So when we came to to make what will be the last Beatles' record, it was a demo that John had [and] we were able to take John's voice and get it pure through this AI. <br/>\"Then we can mix the record, as you would normally do. So it gives you some sort of leeway.\"<br/>However, the musician admitted that other applications of AI gave him cause for concern. <br/>\"I'm not on the internet that much [but] people will say to me, 'Oh, yeah, there's a track where John's singing one of my songs', and it's just AI, you know? <br/>\"It's kind of scary but exciting, because it's the future. We'll just have to see where that leads.\"<br/>The star was talking to Radio 4 ahead of the launch of a new book and accompanying photography exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery.<br/>Titled Eyes Of The Storm, the project features portraits taken by Sir Paul on his own camera, between December 1963 and February 1964, as the Beatles were catapulted to global fame.<br/>Beatles' Revolver: How AI has revived a classic<br/>McCartney's Glasto show revealed in unseen photos<br/>Sting: AI-written songs don't impress me at all<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

She described the findings as \"quite novel and quite exciting\".<br/>Napping has been shown to be critical for development when we are babies, becomes less common as we age and then goes through a resurgence in popularity after retirement, with 27% of people over 65 reporting having a daytime nap. <br/>Dr Garfield says advice to nap is \"something quite easy\" to do in comparison to weight loss or exercise which are \"difficult for a lot of people\".<br/>The brain naturally shrinks with age, but whether naps could help prevent diseases like Alzheimer's will still need extra research. <br/>Overall brain health is important for protecting against dementia and the condition is linked to disturbed sleep.<br/>The researchers suggest poor sleep is damaging the brain over time by causing inflammation and affecting the connections between brain cells. <br/>\"Thus, regular napping could protect against neurodegeneration by compensating for deficient sleep,\" researcher Valentina Paz said.<br/>However, Dr Garfield is not about to find a comfy spot to snooze at work and prefers other ways of looking after her brain.<br/>\"Honestly, I would rather spend 30\u00a0minutes exercising than napping, I'll probably try and recommend that my mum does it.\" <br/>Studying napping can be a challenge. <br/>Napping might boost health, but the reverse is also true as your health can leave you so tired you need to nap more. <br/>So the researchers used a clever technique to prove that napping is beneficial. <br/>They used a gigantic natural experiment based on the DNA - the genetic code -  with which we are born. Previous studies have identified 97 snippets of our DNA that either make us more likely to be nappers or to power through the day. <br/>So the team took data from 35,000 people, aged 40 to 69, taking part in the UK Biobank project and simply compared those genetic \"nappers\" and \"non-nappers\".<br/>The results, published in the journal Sleep Health, showed a 15 cubic centimetre difference - equivalent to 2.6 to 6.5 years of ageing. Total brain volumes were about 1,480 cubic centimetres in the study. <br/>\"I enjoy short naps on the weekends and this study has convinced me that I shouldn't feel lazy napping, it may even be protecting my brain,\" Prof Tara Spires-Jones, from the University of Edinburgh and the president of the British Neuroscience Association, told me.<br/>She said the \"interesting\" findings study showed a \"small but significant increase in brain volume\" and \"adds to the data indicating that sleep is important for brain health\".<br/>The researchers did not directly study having a big sleep in the middle of the day, but said the science pointed towards a cut off of half an hour. <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

I took that option as I wasn't just doing it for myself. <br/>\"After donating I started to feel quite guilty. I wasn't sure that I had done the right thing.

Finding out a child was born made those guilty feelings go away,\" she said.<br/>Ms Henry went on to have her own children with a new partner, and never used her frozen eggs, which have now been disposed of.<br/>\"I fell pregnant naturally and quite quickly and had my first daughter at age 39 and I am currently on maternity leave again having had my son last December, aged 44,\" she said.<br/>\"This will be an ongoing conversation with my two children that they have a genetic sister out there in the world.

She has also kept three as unfertilised eggs, which have a 10% chance.<br/>She shared her feelings throughout the treatment, saying there was \"not enough genuine, honest information out there\".<br/>Success is strongly dependent on the age of the woman at the time of freezing her eggs, the HFEA said, with higher success rates in those aged under 35.<br/>Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Bassel Wattar said more work was needed to inform patients and support them through their fertility journey.<br/>\"Unfortunately, there is limited public awareness on the pros and cons of this treatment and how it could be best planned to optimise chances of starting a family in the future,\" he said.<br/>Are you freezing your eggs?

They were ordered to suspend their practice for six months, and were fined 1.4m Taiwanese dollars (\u00a335,989, $46,121).<br/>Amid growing public concern, Taipei City Hospital has also begun offering free blood tests for preschool children to check for traces of sedatives.<br/>The measures come after the scandal first emerged in May, when parents at a private preschool in New Taipei City accused staff of feeding their children \"unknown drugs\".<br/>Mike, a father of a five-year-old child, told BBC Chinese that parents had noticed what appeared to be withdrawal symptoms in their children over the long Lunar New Year holiday period in February.<br/>\"Some parents found their children, over the vacation, had become irritable, restless and screamed when sleeping, and even cried out with leg cramps,\" he said.<br/>After speaking to the children, parents learnt that their teachers had fed them an \"unknown potion\". Complaints were filed with police in April and May.<br/>Following more complaints from parents in June, local authorities launched an investigation, and found at least eight children with trace amounts of phenobarbital and benzodiazepines - a class of psychoactive drugs - in their system. <br/>The kindergarten at the centre of the controversy, a franchise of the Kid Castle Educational Institute, was ordered to shut down on 12 June. Its directors have been fined 150,000 Taiwanese dollars(\u00a33,800 $4,872).<br/>The principal and five teachers were arrested and questioned by police but have since been released on bail. A criminal investigation is underway. <br/>Local media reported that the staff said the parents had consented to a list of medicine provided by the school but some parents in response questioned the medicines used by the school.<br/>A Taiwanese pharmacist told local media that, although rare, some cough and gastrointestinal medicine contain phenobarbital.  <br/>Drugs containing phenobarbital are mostly used in the treatment of epilepsy and or used as surgical anaesthesia, and are difficult to obtain. <br/>Benzodiazepines are a class of depressant drugs most commonly used to treat severe anxiety.<br/>The drugs are highly addictive, and overdose may lead to drowsiness and shortness of breath. <br/>China and Taiwan: A really simple guide<br/>Taiwan sees MeToo outpouring after Netflix show<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

She's sitting in the back of court,\" Mr Johnson said.<br/>Focusing on specific babies in the case, Mr Johnson later asked the jury to consider the evidence of the mother of Child E. <br/>She told the court in November last year that she went to feed her son, who subsequently died, on the night of 3 August 2015. <br/>Child E's mother said she heard her son making \"horrendous\" sounds when she arrived on the neonatal unit and found him with blood around his mouth.<br/>She told the court that she saw Ms Letby stood near a work station on the unit and when she alerted her to the blood, she was told it was due to a feeding tube. <br/>Ms Letby in her evidence denied having this interaction and said no blood was sighted in Child E's mouth before 22:00 that night. <br/>\"Have [the parents] made that up, to get at Lucy Letby? Are they in on it? Are they a sub-gang of two?\" Mr Johnson asked. <br/>Mr Johnson said this was \"a head on credibility contest\" and either Child E's mother was \"lying\" or Ms Letby was \"lying\". <br/>He said of the mother's account: \"It's powerful evidence - independent of the medical evidence - that Lucy Letby murdered [Child E]\". <br/>The trial continues.<br/>Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Fertility can be triggering and it doesn't always end in happiness. I tried to be sensitive but I wasn't prepared for some people to be so cruel.\"<br/>Vicky, who found fame on the reality show Geordie Shore in her native Newcastle, had to take a break from social media.<br/>\"People were saying 'why don't you just have a baby now you've got a boyfriend?' It is so toxic and outdated. I know so many people who had children with the wrong men because they were scared that they were running out of time.<br/>\"Why aren't we celebrating women who say 'this isn't the right time and I want to give my future children the best start in life'? It is so important we all know there are many different routes to motherhood.\"<br/>Breaking down in tears, she recalls the message that made her realise she had made the right decision to be so open.<br/>\"This woman said 'none of my friends have gone through this and I was feeling scared and alone and I hated the injections but every night after I had done it I came on social media to see if you had done yours'. <br/>\"It made her feel less alone and I thought 'I am in a very small way providing people with some comfort'.\"<br/>The author and podcaster won I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in 2015 and appeared on Loose Women shortly after, declaring that she did not want children.<br/>\"I've never been a maternal person, I've always been very career focussed,\" she explains. \"I kept waiting for this moment that I would have this burning desire to have children, but it never really came. <br/>\"The older I got, the more scared I became that it would kick in at an age when my body wasn't able to have children naturally.\"<br/>Vicky started looking into the process of egg freezing in her early 30s, after finding herself single again. Then she met her fianc\u00e9 Ercan Ramadan and \"became really happy\".<br/>\"I started to want things that I had never wanted before, like a house rather than a flat in London and dogs and a slower pace of life and wanting children came on my radar.<br/>\"But, even though I'm in a happy relationship, it is still in its infancy and Ercan is younger than me, he's not ready either. It was a mutual decision. We are in love but we don't want that pressure.\"<br/>An egg-freezing cycle involves taking drugs to boost your production of eggs, which are later collected while you are under general anaesthetic or sedation, and frozen for future use.<br/>Egg freezing has increased tenfold in the past decade in the UK, from just under 230 treatment cycles in 2009, to almost 2,400 in 2019.<br/>In 2021, the most common age for egg freezing was 35, with success strongly dependent on the age of the woman at the time of freezing her eggs, with higher success rates in those aged 35 and under.<br/>Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority<br/>Vicky had to make another difficult decision when it came to how many eggs to have fertilised with Ercan's sperm.<br/>\"I have been hurt before and it would be foolhardy to not have a back-up plan so I decided to keep some to myself. I'm safeguarding my future happiness,\" she says.<br/>\"I convinced myself it would be an awkward conversation but Ercan was so supportive.\"<br/>The couple started having tests at The London Women's Clinic in Brentwood last October but had to pause treatment after they found a cyst on one of Vicky's ovaries.<br/>\"I was crestfallen because I had this big plan. I was putting too much pressure on myself and my body. I'm so grateful for social media because I had this community to get advice from.\"<br/>They had to wait until April for the egg collection, but it was not a smooth process for Vicky. <br/>\"At about day ten my follicles were not where they needed to be so the solution is to up your hormones. I was struggling anyway but I would sit and burst into tears randomly. It is such a turbulent time for your body and mind.<br/>\"I tried my best to show the good and bad days. I was so stressed about the injections but they weren't too bad where as I underestimated how hard the hormones would be.\"  <br/>Three of Vicky's eggs were turned into embryos, which she was told have a 20% chance of resulting in a baby, and she decided to keep three as unfertilised eggs, which have a 10% chance.<br/>\"It has taken the pressure off loads. We are planning a wedding and we want to enjoy married life. This has given us the luxury of time and options,\" she says.<br/>The process is expensive, she adds, with the NHS only funding egg freezing for certain medical reasons, for example in advance of cancer treatment. <br/>\"I feel so grateful to be in a position to do it. I do think it should be available to more women. <br/>\"I had spent my whole life in a rush to be loved so I could do all the things I thought a woman was meant to do but now I'm doing things when they are right for me so I feel really empowered.\"<br/>Vicky has created a video diary of the whole process, which will be shown on ITV1's Lorraine.<br/>\"My hope is that it will help women struggling with their own journeys and also encourage a little more understanding and compassion around the subject, as well as helping women realise their own options.\"<br/>Watch Vicky Pattison - My Journey To Motherhood on Lorraine from 9am on Tuesday 20 June on ITV1 and ITVX<br/>Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

That's one million more people than five years previously, NHS prescribing figures show. <br/>The new figures on long-term use - for the period 2018-2022 - were provided to BBC Panorama by the NHS, following a Freedom of Information request. The data gives an overall picture but does not reflect the circumstances of individual patients, some of whom could be on antidepressants long-term for good reason. <br/>The investigation also uncovered evidence that a leading drug company attempted 27 years ago to conceal possible withdrawal effects that one drug could cause.<br/>Modern antidepressants - called SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors) - arrived from the late 1980s, including Prozac. They were quickly heralded as wonder drugs compared with earlier medications, some of which had serious side effects.<br/>They were thought to treat depression by fixing an imbalance of the mood-regulating chemical serotonin in the brain. Researchers are now not clear how they work. One theory is that they simply change how you think or feel, rather than rectifying an underlying problem.<br/>The NHS recommends antidepressants as a treatment for more severe depression. Talking therapy as well as exercise and lifestyle changes might be recommended instead of, or in combination with, the medication. <br/>\"Throughout my long and extensive career, I have seen people benefit from antidepressants,\" said Prof Wendy Burn, former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists.  <br/>\"I see them working in my clinical practice, I see lives being changed by them.\"<br/>But she added: \"People are staying on antidepressants longer, and we don't really have long-term studies that support that.\"<br/>There has long been a debate about how effective antidepressants are. The most comprehensive research, from the University of Oxford, suggests antidepressants do help some people, at least in the short-term. <br/>But on average, their benefits are relatively modest, and the way people respond varies, with some not responding at all, according to the researcher who led the study.<br/>And there is some evidence to suggest that long-term antidepressant use may be linked to some health risks, such as heart problems and diabetes. It is also thought that long-term use may lead to a higher risk of withdrawal symptoms in some people.<br/>Withdrawal can happen when you stop a drug that your body has become used to. <br/>Taking that drug away too quickly, before the brain has had time to adjust, can lead to symptoms - including low mood and feelings of anxiety. Some symptoms overlap with the original condition the drug was prescribed for, which means the withdrawal can sometimes be confused with relapse.<br/>The symptoms depend on the individual, which drug they were taking, and for how long. Many patients can stop taking antidepressants without experiencing any problems.<br/>If you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line<br/>Panorama has uncovered evidence to suggest that one major drug company which manufactured SSRI antidepressants had become increasingly aware of a whole range of withdrawal symptoms from the mid-1990s, but was reluctant to share this information with the public and medicines regulators.<br/>A copy of a confidential 1996 memo from firm Pfizer - which originally sold sertraline, now the UK's most common antidepressant - shows employees discussing what the drug company would tell regulators in Norway. <br/>\"We should not volunteer to describe the withdrawal symptoms, but have an agreed list prepared in case they insist,\" the memo says. <br/>Some of the withdrawal reactions the memo refers to include sensory disturbances, sweating, nausea, insomnia, tremors, agitation and anxiety.<br/>Pfizer no longer produces sertraline. Responding to Panorama's findings, a spokesperson said the company \"monitored and reported all adverse event data\" to licensing authorities, \"in line with its legal and regulatory obligations and updated sertraline labelling as required.\" <br/>It added: \"Public health organisations and professional medical bodies throughout the world have recognised sertraline and other SSRIs as the treatment of choice for adult depression.\" The company said the drug's label warned about withdrawal and had been updated \"as required\".<br/>The Royal College of Psychiatrists published updated information on withdrawal in 2019 - overseen by Prof Burn, who was its president at the time. It came after she heard testimony from patients who had experienced severe withdrawal effects.<br/>Until then, guidance used by the NHS and the college maintained withdrawal was mostly mild and short-lived - lasting no more than about a week. <br/>Now NHS guidance reflects that it can be severe and longer-lasting for some, and withdrawal can last many months.<br/>Information on stopping antidepressants <br/>A Royal College of Psychiatrists spokesperson told the BBC: \"Medicine continuously evolves, as does our knowledge of treating mental illness. As a result, the college updates its guidance when new evidence comes to light.\"<br/>A lack of awareness about withdrawal difficulties has meant that even medical professionals who prescribe the drugs have struggled to stop taking antidepressants themselves. <br/>Dr Mark Horowitz, who tried to stop the antidepressants he had taken for 15 years in 2015, said: \"It led to complete havoc in my life,\" he says. \"I would wake up in the morning in full panic, like I was being chased by an animal.\"<br/>The panic he felt would last until late into the evenings and he took up running as a distraction. <br/>\"I ran until my feet bled, because it gave me a slight reprieve from that panic sensation.\" <br/>He said it was worse than the symptoms that led him to take antidepressants in the first place. <br/>The Antidepressant Story<br/>Panorama examines whether the current generation of antidepressant drugs have lived up to their promises, following patients who have suffered serious side effects.<br/>Watch The Antidepressant Story on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 19 June (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) and on BBC iPlayer afterwards (UK only)<br/>He is concerned that far more work has been done on how to start patients on antidepressants - and much less on stopping. <br/>\"To me, it's the same as allowing cars to be sold without brakes,\" he said. <br/>\"We should know how to start the car and how to stop it.\"<br/>Now Dr Horowitz runs England's only NHS antidepressant deprescribing clinic - a pilot scheme set up in London in 2021 to help people struggling to stop taking their medication.  <br/>At the moment he is seeing about 25 patients.<br/>Despite withdrawal guidance having been updated, Dr Horowitz thinks patients are still struggling to get tailored advice. Guidance for doctors now recommends that people reduce the dose of their medication in stages, but it does not specify how long it should take. It's different for everyone. <br/>The Royal College of GPs told Panorama that family doctors were \"highly-trained to have frank and sensitive conversations\" with patients about the risks and benefits of antidepressants. <br/>\"Amid intense workload and workforce pressures,\" it said it was, \"increasingly difficult to offer patients the time they need within the constraints of a standard 10-minute consultation.\" <br/>The companies behind the most widely used antidepressants told Panorama that many clinical trials and studies, including ones conducted by independent researchers, had shown their drugs to be effective. <br/>They said the drugs had been taken by many millions worldwide for potentially devastating and sometimes life-threatening conditions. <br/>As with all medicines, they said, antidepressants have potential side effects which are clearly stated in the prescribing information. They added that their drugs are considered to be safe, with a positive benefit-risk ratio by doctors, patients and regulators around the world.<br/>Follow BBC Panorama on Twitter<br/>Antidepressants exit must be slow - says watchdog<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Established and funded by government, they are led by an independent chair.<br/>An inquiry has the power to make people appear as witnesses and can demand evidence. <br/>No one is found guilty or innocent, but conclusions about lessons learned are published. Inquiries can make recommendations although these do not have to be adopted by ministers. <br/>The Covid inquiry, launched by Boris Johnson in May 2021, covers decision-making during the pandemic in both Westminster and the devolved administrations.<br/>At the time, Mr Johnson said all aspects of the UK's response would be \"under the microscope\". <br/>It is being chaired by Baroness Heather Hallett, a retired judge and crossbench peer.<br/>She previously led the inquests into the 7/7 London bombings.<br/>The inquiry has no formal deadline but is due to hold public hearings across the UK until at least 2025.<br/>At the first public hearing in London, Baroness Hallett said she planned to publish updates and reports \"as we go along\" on the inquiry's website. <br/>Public hearings are streamed on the inquiry's YouTube channel, and witness transcripts will be published on its website.<br/>Members of the public can apply to attend public hearings in person. <br/>The inquiry is split into different parts.<br/>Work in four areas has already begun:<br/>Future strands - with hearings due in 2024 and 2025 - will look at:<br/>Scotland is also holding a separate inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett's team is expected to focus on the biggest and most controversial aspects of the government's response, including:<br/>The inquiry is also expected to consider whether too many restrictions were imposed as the pandemic progressed. <br/>Over the course of 80 days in autumn 2020, for example, England went from the so-called \"rule of six\" to a tiered system of regulations, then into a national lockdown and then back to tiers.<br/>The government's policy towards schools is also likely to be on the agenda. Schools closed to most pupils in March 2020 and then again in January 2021.  <br/>The first public hearings have taken evidence from independent experts, including infectious-diseases specialist Prof David Heymann, and some government officials. <br/>Former Prime Minister David Cameron and former Chancellor George Osborne will appear before the committee in the second week of hearings, as will the current Deputy Prime Minister, Oliver Dowden, and Chancellor (and former Health Secretary) Jeremy Hunt. <br/>Sir Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser during the pandemic, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser will also give evidence. <br/>Members of the public have been invited to share their experiences through the inquiry's Every Story Matters project.<br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign group - which has been critical of the government's handling of the pandemic - has urged the inquiry to ensure these voices are heard.<br/>The inquiry asked to see unredacted WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and 40 people. <br/>They include former No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and former chancellor and current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. <br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Baroness Hallett said it was her job to decide if material was relevant.<br/>However Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. He said earlier messages were not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and had not been used since. <br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>Covid-19 Public Inquiry<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Although, they are not truly \"synthetic\", as the starting material was cells cultured from a traditional embryo in the laboratory. <br/>\"It's beautiful and created entirely from embryonic stem cells,\" Prof Zernicka-Goetz told the Guardian newspaper.<br/>She has already developed synthetic mouse embryos with evidence of a developing brain and beating heart. <br/>Meanwhile, scientists in China have implanted synthetic monkey embryos into female monkeys - although, all the pregnancies failed. <br/>The synthetic embryos do not behave in exactly the same way as normal embryos. And it is unclear how their use in research should be governed.<br/>Prof Briscoe said: \"On the one hand, models of human embryos made of stem cells might offer an ethical and more readily available alternative to the use of IVF-derived [in-vitro fertilisation] human embryos. <br/>\"On the other hand, the closer stem-cell-derived models of human embryos mirror human embryos, the more important it is to have clear regulations and guidelines for how they are used.\" <br/>Most countries use the 14-day rule in human-embryo research. This allows an embryo created by fertilising a human egg to be grown for 14 days.<br/>However, these \"embryo models\" are not legally \"embryos\" and are not governed by the same laws.  <br/>Dr Ildem Akerman, from the University of Birmingham, said: \"These findings suggest that we would soon develop the technology to grow these cells beyond the 14-day limit, with potentially more insights to gain into human development. <br/>\"Nevertheless, the ability to do something does not justify doing it.\" <br/>Legal and ethical experts in the UK are drawing up a voluntary set of guidelines for how to proceed.  <br/>Researchers hope these synthetic embryos will further understanding of the earliest stages of human's lives.<br/>Prof Roger Sturmey, from the University of Manchester, said: \"We know remarkably little about this step in human development but it is a time where many pregnancies are lost.<br/>\"So models that can enable us to study this period are urgently needed to help to understand infertility and early pregnancy loss.\" <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

But most people find this very difficult.<br/>Experts, such as the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT), generally recommend some sort of gradual approach.<br/>One tip for vapers is to reduce the nicotine strength of their e-liquid in two to four-week stages, working down to 0% solutions.<br/>This can be trickier with disposable vapes, which tend to come in higher strengths.<br/>But zero-nicotine versions are available, and the NCSCT says using one alongside your regular vape can help.<br/>Failing that, a temporary switch to a tank-style vape, giving you access to different e-liquids, might be better. <br/>Other reduction strategies include:<br/>Another option is Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) - patches, gum and sprays used instead of a vape.<br/>Nicotine pouches that go between the gum and lip are starting to appear on some shop shelves but these aren't currently recommended by the NHS.<br/>Like smoking, if you've been vaping a long time you're likely to have formed habits around it.<br/>Certain situations or times of day - triggers - will have got you used to reaching for your vape. <br/>This can be hard to snap out of, so it can help to figure out what they are.<br/>It's also a good idea to try and fill this time with something else to distract you, like exercise.<br/>If you are a former smoker, the NCSCT says it's worth keeping a vape on hand for emergencies.<br/>Because, if you do relapse, it's better than reaching for a cigarette.<br/>Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.<br/>Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here<br/>High lead and nickel levels found in illegal vapes<br/>Free vapes to be handed out in anti-smoking drive<br/>Vaping - is it a risk-free option?<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

In England just 61% of patients start treatment in that time against a target of 85%.<br/>Growing delays are, in part, the flip side of a medical success story.<br/>Scientific progress in cancer care has been remarkable, with cutting-edge drugs offering hope where previously there was little that could be done.<br/>New techniques are more effective but often far more complex for doctors to deliver.<br/>At the same time the UK population is getting older - and as cancer risk is strongly linked to age it means more more demand for expensive scanners, along with more staff to analyse those scans, and more specialist doctors and nurses. <br/>The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) describes the situation as a perfect storm - and says the workforce is struggling to keep up.  <br/>Across the four UK nations, it calculates there is now a 15% shortfall of specialist cancer doctors - or clinical oncologists - who deliver chemotherapy and radiotherapy. <br/>Without action, it says this gap will grow to 25% - or a shortage of 368 full-time consultants - by 2027.<br/>Just as concerning is an even larger shortage of consultant radiologists - highly trained doctors who interpret scans to diagnose cancer or monitor its progression.<br/>The RCR says for each month a patient waits to start cancer treatment, the risk of death is increased by about 10%. <br/>In its annual survey, 44% of cancer service managers say they are now \"highly concerned\" about patient delays, up from 29% in the previous year.<br/>\"There are examples in almost every cancer centre where parts of the service just aren't running as well as we would like,\" said Dr Tom Roques, a consultant oncologist and vice-president of the RCR.<br/>\"We're having to tell patients all the time that we can't quite treat them as quickly as we would like, or in the way that we'd like, and that's a stressful thing to have to do.\"<br/>Kevin O'Hara, 60, from County Durham, broke five ribs in a motorbike accident last November. <br/>A scan of his upper body also picked up a shadow near one of his kidneys that was later diagnosed as cancer.<br/>He was offered drug treatment meant to slow the growth of the tumour and - in early February - was told the waiting list for surgery would be three to four months. <br/>That period has now been and gone but he is still waiting for a date for his operation. <br/>\"Every day you are waiting and waiting and nothing changes,\" he said. <br/>\"I come home from work and go to the door and, when there's no envelope that says NHS on the top, I just get so depressed.\" <br/>There is another trend in cancer care which is often overlooked.<br/>The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in people coming forward to get checked after spotting a possible symptom such as an unusual lump, strange mole or unexplained weight loss.<br/>The reasons for that are complex and include a bounceback in demand since Covid, stronger guidance for GPs to refer to cancer specialists, major NHS publicity drives and the work of campaigners such as \"Bowelbabe\" Deborah James.<br/>Cancer doctors view the spike in demand as a \"very good thing\", as a growing proportion of patients are now diagnosed earlier when cancer is easier to treat.<br/>But it also puts more pressure on NHS services, with waiting times for diagnosis and other scans one of the key bottlenecks in the system.<br/>Since Christmas there have been some signs of progress, with the NHS in England reducing the backlog of long waits for treatment and hitting one of its other standards - for faster diagnosis - for the first time. <br/>This video can not be played<br/>In Blackpool, the NHS has hit its skin cancer targets by changing the way patients are diagnosed, in an approach which is now being rolled out across England. <br/>The RCR also says there is a \"chink of light\" - with recruitment of oncologists rising over the last three years, particularly in parts of the country with the worst staff shortages.<br/>It wants each UK nation to increase medical school places and training posts, and says more also needs to be done to stop experienced staff cutting their hours or leaving the profession early. <br/>The Department of Health said that the total number of full-time staff in the cancer workforce in England had risen by 51% to 33,093 since 2010.<br/>A spokesman added: \"We want to build on this progress and will publish a workforce plan shortly to ensure we have the right numbers of staff, with the right number of skills.\"<br/>The Scottish government is also expected to publish its new 10-year cancer strategy within weeks, setting out ways to attract and retain more staff.<br/>The Welsh government recently published a cancer improvement plan and says it is now investing heavily to train more staff and build more diagnostic and treatment centres.  <br/>In Northern Ireland, the health department said it is \"extremely disappointing\" that cancer targets are being missed. It has recently opened two new rapid diagnostic centres and started a \"cancer strategy workforce review\". <br/>Data visualisation by Liana Bravo.<br/>Follow Jim on Twitter.<br/>Has your treatment been affected by the junior doctor strikes?

Check on those who may be more vulnerable, such older people and babies.<br/>Here's what you need to know about the effects of heat on the body and how to stay cool.<br/>As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body.<br/>This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. <br/>At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. <br/>This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include:<br/>If blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.<br/>Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we're in a snowstorm or a heatwave.<br/>It is the temperature our bodies have evolved to work at. <br/>But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down.<br/>It opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating.<br/>As the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin.<br/>The UK Health Security Agency has some tips:<br/>Use thin sheets, cool your socks in the fridge before putting them on and stick to your usual bedtime routine, experts say.<br/>If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.<br/>NHS advice says: <br/>However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heat stroke.<br/>It is a medical emergency and you should call 999.<br/>People with heat stroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 40C and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. <br/>Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body.<br/>Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. <br/>Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it.<br/>People who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures.<br/>Yes - but people should keep taking their medication as normal and need to make more effort to stay cool and hydrated.<br/>Diuretics - sometimes called \"water pills\" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure. In high temperatures, they increase the dangers of dehydration and imbalances in key minerals in the body.<br/>Antihypertensives - which lower blood pressure - can combine with the blood vessels that are dilating to cope with the heat and cause dangerous drops in blood pressure.<br/>Some drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson's can block sweating and make it harder for the body to cool itself.<br/>And other drugs such as lithium or statins can become more concentrated and problematic in the blood if there is too much fluid loss. <br/>There are about 2,000 deaths caused by high temperatures in England every year.<br/>Most of these will be heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.<br/>The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C.<br/>However, the evidence suggests the deaths tend to be caused by higher temperatures in spring or early summer rather than \"peak summer\".<br/>This could be because we start to change our day-to-day behaviour as summer progresses and we get more used to dealing with the heat.<br/>The evidence from previous heatwaves is the increase in deaths happens very quickly - within the first 24 hours of the heatwave. <br/>Follow James on Twitter.<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

both epidemiologists - said a coronavirus had already jumped to humans on a significant scale twice in the 21st Century, in the form of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).<br/>And it had been \"a reasonable bet\", before 2020, another one might follow, infectious-diseases expert and former professor of international public health Jimmy Whitworth said.<br/>By mid-January 2020, people in the international public-health community had been aware the Covid-19 outbreak had been \"out of the ordinary\", he said.<br/>\"It wasn't going to die away - it was something bigger than that,\" Mr Whitworth said.<br/>And by end of January, people in public health had been very clear it had been \"an impending wave that was coming to UK\".<br/>\"For those of us who had memories of Sars, the parallels were something that gave us shivers\", Mr Whitworth added.<br/>Asked about the dangers of a virus being leaked, deliberately or accidentally, from a laboratory, Cambridge University fellow in emerging infectious diseases Dr Charlotte Hammer said she was aware of four incidents involving the Sars virus. <br/>But when it came to controlling an outbreak once it had started to infect thousands of people, the virus's origins mattered \"very little\".<br/>What is the UK Covid-19 inquiry?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss, in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe, in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered -

or module - will examine how well prepared the UK was for Covid up to January 2020. <br/>Mr Keith said: \"Even at this stage, before hearing the evidence, it is apparent that we might not have been very well prepared at all.\"<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Bereaved families express their loss in a film shown to the inquiry<br/>Chair Baroness Hallett pledged that the inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus pandemic would be the \"thorough investigation\" that the public deserves.<br/>The former High Court judge paid tribute to a \"dignified vigil\" of bereaved family members holding a silent protest outside of the building. <br/>Lady Hallett said there were three key questions to be answered for the \"millions of people who have suffered and continue to suffer\": <br/>This first part of the inquiry will hear from key politicians, civil servants, scientists, unions, health and care organisations, groups representing victims and their relatives and more. <br/>The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group has criticised the inquiry's timetable and says people have been \"excluded from sharing key evidence\".<br/>They branded the inquiry's Every Story Matters project - where members of the public can share their experience with the inquiry through a website - an \"inadequate\" process because stories will be anonymised and summarised and possibly \"open to bias and interpretation by third parties\".<br/>Addressing critics of the inquiry, Lady Hallett said she hoped they would understand the difficult balance she has had to strike.<br/>\"I am listening to them, their loss will be recognised, they will be able to contribute to the inquiry.\"<br/>Mr Keith, counsel to the inquiry, said UK was \"taken by surprise\" over \"significant aspects\" of the pandemic, including lockdowns. <br/>\"Extraordinary though it may seem, given that it's a word that's forever seared in the nation's consciousness, there was very little debate pre-pandemic of whether a lockdown might prove to be necessary in the event of a runaway virus, let alone how a lockdown could be avoided.<br/>\"Very little thought was given to how, if it proved to be necessary, how something as complex, difficult and damaging as a national lockdown could be put in place at all.<br/>\"Equally, there appears to have been a failure to think through the potentially massive impact on education and on the economy.\"<br/>He said the UK had been preparing for an outbreak more similar to flu, and questioned how well placed and funded the NHS was to cope.<br/>\"No amount of foresight or planning can guarantee that a country will not make mistakes when a disease strikes, but that does not mean that we should not strive to be as ready as we sensibly can be,\" Mr Keith said.<br/>\"No country can be perfectly prepared, but it can certainly be underprepared.\"<br/>Mr Keith highlighted \"shocking\" data showing that Covid mortality was two-and-a-half times higher in some of the most deprived parts of the UK than the richest, with people in some ethnic minority groups or with a disability far more likely to be infected or die of the disease.<br/>To what extent those outcomes could and should have been foreseen and mitigated would be a \"big question\" in module one, he said. <br/>The wider political environment will also be considered including the possible impact of Brexit on emergency planning.<br/>\"Did the attention paid to the risks of a no-deal Brexit - Operation Yellowhammer as it was known - drain resources and capacity that should have been continuing the fight against the next pandemic?\" Mr Keith asked.<br/>\"Or did that generic and operational planning, in fact, lead to people being better trained and well-marshalled, and in fact better prepared to deal with Covid?<br/>\"On the evidence so far... we very much fear that it was the former.\"<br/>The inquiry will also examine if the collapse of the power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland damaged the ability of authorities to plan and respond to the pandemic. <br/>Mr Keith said it was unlikely we will ever know how Covid started - whether it emerged from a lab leak or from farmed wild animals that were sold in Wuhan. Nor when the first human infection happened, he said. <br/>\"For this inquiry's purposes, this knowledge does not matter.\" <br/>In his opening remarks, Pete Weatherby KC, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the \"closest to an overall plan\" to deal with Covid in 2020 was a 2011 document drawn up to protect the UK from an outbreak of influenza. <br/>\"With a pandemic, time is of the essence and lost time is measured in lives,\" he said. <br/>\"The families expect the evidence will show\u2026 little or no ministerial leadership and the chaos of committees which led to poor planning and ultimately a reactive rather than a proactive response to the virus.\" <br/>In response to the Brexit claims, a spokesperson for the prime minister said the government would not be responding to every issue raised in the inquiry.<br/>He added that it would be up to the government to respond at the appropriate stage.  <br/>Lady Hallett has asked to see ex-prime minister Boris Johnson's unredacted WhatsApp messages between him and around 40 politicians and officials, but this is being challenged by his successor, Rishi Sunak.<br/>The Cabinet Office launched a legal challenge against the request, arguing some of the messages were irrelevant. This is thought to be the first time a government has taken legal action against its own public inquiry.<br/>Mr Johnson said he was \"perfectly content\" for the inquiry to have WhatsApp messages sent after May 2021. Earlier messages are not available because his mobile phone was involved in a security breach and has not been used since.<br/>Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said he was happy to share his messages, although many of these have already been leaked by the journalist Isabel Oakeshott, who helped Mr Hancock write his book, Pandemic Diaries.<br/>In a statement about the back-and-forth over the messages, Rishi Sunak's spokesperson said it \"is still ongoing\" and will \"obviously... be resolved through the normal process\".<br/>\"Broadly, we continue to provide tens of thousands of pieces of information to the inquiry, 55,000 documents over the past 11 months and we will do so in the spirit of transparency and candour.\"<br/>The UK saw one of the worst first waves of Covid in Europe in spring 2020. <br/>In April and May that year, about 160,000 deaths were registered: 60,000 more than you'd expect based on the years just before the pandemic. <br/>But by that winter the UK had been overtaken by many countries in eastern Europe who had seemed to escape the first wave. <br/>The UK's Office for National Statistics has continued to analyse these figures for Europe and, as of July last year, put the UK  in the middle of the pack. <br/>According to Department of Health figures, 227,321 people died across the UK with Covid recorded on their death certificate.<br/>Covid vaccines have prevented many deaths and serious illness from the virus - more than 151m doses have been given in the UK. <br/>The questions we want the Covid inquiry to answer<br/>What is the UK Covid inquiry and how long will it take?<br/>UK Covid-19 Inquiry<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

Now, with the FBI adding its voice, the politics and division behind the hunt for the truth are being laid bare.<br/>There are few scientific debates as divisive and toxic as the question of Covid's origin. <br/>While researching for the upcoming podcast I'm making for the BBC about it, I've heard virologists question the motives and professionalism of colleagues with whom they disagree over two alternative possibilities.<br/>They are whether the virus infected its first human in a Wuhan market, or in a Chinese government-controlled lab. <br/>\"I wouldn't want [him] to be doing that experiment,\" one eminent virologist said dismissively of another who had raised questions about the risks of the Wuhan scientists' work. <br/>Professional relationships have been damaged and friendships lost. Some have simply had enough. <br/>\"Nothing personal, but I'm not prepared to take part in anything that gives air time to the lab leak conspiracy horseshit,\" one virologist said to me when I invited him to take part in our series. <br/>It should be no surprise then that US intelligence agencies and government departments have also struggled to reach a consensus on Covid's origins.<br/>The recent news that the US Department of Energy has changed its intelligence assessment to conclude - apparently with low confidence - that the virus came from a lab, brings the number of agencies supporting that view to two. <br/>It had already been reported that the FBI had come to the same conclusion - with a \"moderate\" level of confidence - and now FBI Director Christopher Wray has spelled out in public that the bureau believes \"a potential lab incident\" was to blame.<br/>Four US intelligence agencies are said to still believe the evidence points to the virus coming from nature, and two remain undecided. <br/>The intelligence assessments are based, of course, on classified information.  The different agencies are part of what's known in the US as the \"intelligence community\", with each one drawing on different expertise and sources of information, from human intelligence to the work of government scientists.<br/>The Department of Energy's Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence, for example, can call on scientific and technological know-how from the 17 national laboratories that are overseen by the department.<br/>The agencies' work can overlap but it's unclear how much they've collaborated on the question of the origin of Covid.<br/>There were claims during the days of the Trump administration that several researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a national-level research facility known to have been studying and experimenting with coronaviruses, had become sick in November 2019, leading them to seek hospital treatment. <br/>But no details have been released about the sourcing of that intelligence.  <br/>And the US government has said the symptoms were consistent with both Covid-19 and common seasonal illnesses - making it difficult for anyone to independently assess the true relevance of the claim. <br/>In early 2020, the lab-leak theory's association with President Donald Trump led some to treat it as disinformation: a deliberate, even xenophobic attempt to deflect blame for his administration's own handling of the pandemic.  <br/>But there were scientific arguments too - with claims that an examination of the genetic structure of Sars-CoV-2 proved conclusively that it couldn't have come from a lab.  <br/>Later, others would argue that analysis of the early patient data around that Wuhan market where the disease first emerged went even further to prove a natural origin beyond all doubt - and we will hear from some of those scientists in our podcast. <br/>These scientists may wonder whether politics are once again at play in the timing of the comments from the FBI director, a Trump appointee, just as the Republican Party, now in control of the US House of Representatives, begins to turn its attention to the lab-leak once again.<br/>On the other hand, under President Biden the lab-leak theory has been largely freed of its associations with his predecessor.<br/>Which is perhaps why other scientists are increasingly willing to speak out about their concern that the theory may have been too swiftly dismissed. <br/>Professor Larry Gostin, from Georgetown University and an advisor to the World Health Organization \u00a0- although himself favouring a natural origin - does not believe there is yet enough evidence to definitively rule out a lab-leak and thinks it was a mistake to try to do so. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"Science shouldn't discount the public interest like that,\" he told me. He suggests that Donald Trump, who has indulged in conspiracy theories across a range of other issues, may in fact have been right to question this narrative. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\"I mean, yes, you do have conspiracy theories. But was he, you know, wrong in wanting that information about the lab? No.\"<br/>Some experts hope that Congress may now be able to uncover new information.  <br/>US scientists have collaborated closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology and there may yet be data held by government agencies or research archives that could prove useful.  <br/>Meanwhile the Chinese government of course pushes back at any and all suggestions that the virus came from China - via a market or a lab.  <br/>My own attempts to examine those possibilities led, at least in part, to my forcible departure from the country, under threat of legal action by the authorities in 2021.  <br/>State media accused me of \"stigmatising China as being the origin of the novel coronavirus\" and of having \"maliciously incited hostility from the international community to China.\" <br/>The question of Covid's origin is likely to remain shrouded in bitterness, acrimony and politics in both Washington and Beijing.<br/>The lack of information is both why President Biden ordered his intelligence agencies in 2021 to use \"every tool\" to look again for answers, and also why they're finding them so hard to come by. <br/>John's podcast on the hunt for the origin of Covid is coming soon on BBC Sounds and BBC Radio 4<br/>Covid origin likely China lab incident - FBI chief<br/>Covid origin studies say evidence points to market<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

That's a good thing for communication, for families and for most people.\"<br/>Face coverings were first recommended in healthcare settings in June 2020.<br/>The requirement to wear them in other places, such as on buses and in shops, was then introduced later as the country opened up after Covid lockdown measures. <br/>This legal requirement ended in April last year but guidance for health and social care settings was kept in place.<br/>Now staff, patients, service users and visitors will no longer be routinely asked to wear face masks in these settings.<br/>The BBC has heard from people with health conditions who have concerns about the latest relaxation of the rules.<br/>Brian Keeley, from Aberdeen, had a heart transplant in 2013 and takes medication every day to suppress his immune system and prevent organ rejection.<br/>Although he expects medics in immunotherapy settings will continue to wear masks, Brian frequently has appointments in other healthcare settings where he fears people may not be as careful.<br/>He said: \"I go to clinic every six months, but I also have to go to the GP, to respiratory appointments, local clinics to give blood samples, vaccinations clinics that are full of people.<br/>\"These are things we have to do anyway and nobody there knows the level of vulnerability of people. <br/>\"I was at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary recently and everyone there was wearing face masks.

The BBC has not seen or independently verified the WhatsApp messages nor the context in which they were sent.<br/>After congratulating the then education secretary Sir Gavin Williamson on delaying A-level exams for a few weeks - a shorter period than some teaching unions called for - Mr Hancock had some choice words. <br/>On 1 October 2020, Mr Hancock messaged Sir Gavin: \"Cracking announcement today. What a bunch of absolute arses the teaching unions are.\"<br/>Sir Gavin replied: \"I know they really really do just hate work.\"<br/>In response, Mr Hancock returned two laughing out loud and a bullseye emoji. <br/>Mr Hancock texted his old boss George Osborne, ex-chancellor and then-Evening Standard editor, on 28 April 2020 to \"call in a favour\" asking for a favourable front page, as he tried to reach his own deadline to reach 100,000 daily Covid tests. <br/>Mr Osborne replied: \"Yes - of course - all you need to do tomorrow is give some exclusive words to the Standard and I'll tell the team to splash it.\"<br/>After replying with a quote, Hancock later writes in capital letters: \"I WANT TO HIT MY TARGET!\"<br/>The editor answered bluntly: \"I gathered.\"  <br/>In another interaction, on 9 November 2020 Mr Hancock asked for an explanation about Mr Osborne calling for Boris Johnson to make testing his number one priority and insisted: \"OK but mass testing is going very well.\"<br/>\"No-one thinks testing is going well, Matt,\" Mr Osborne replied. <br/>Sir Gavin, messaging Mr Hancock, on 10 May 2020 ahead of schools reopening, asked for the health secretary's help in getting personal protective equipment (PPE) for schools \"as a last resort so they can't use it as a reason not to open\". <br/>The education secretary texted: \"All of them will [open] but some will just want to say they can't so they have an excuse to avoid having to teach, what joys!!!\"<br/>Boris Johnson had misgivings about the government's shielding advice in discussions with the chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty. In August 2020 the then-prime minister suggested that if renewed lockdown restrictions were needed over-65s be offered a choice on shielding.<br/>Mr Johnson, addressing Sir Chris in a WhatsApp group on 9 August, said: \"If you are over 65 your risk of dying from Covid is probably as big as your risk of falling down stairs. And we don't stop older people from using stairs. What do you think?\"      <br/>Sir Chris conceded that he \"would think twice before shielding unless it threatened the NHS\". Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance replied: \"We haven't found shielding easy or very effective first time round.\"<br/>Only a few days previously, shielding had ended for more than two million clinically vulnerable people in England, Scotland and Wales. Since March 2020 they had been advised to stay at home to avoid contracting Covid. Shielding later returned. <br/>Helen Whately, who was social care minister at the time, travelled 50 miles to a Covid test centre so a relative could be tested in September 2020, according to the Telegraph. There were restricted numbers of home testing kits and the public had to book a slot at a testing centre, where they could swab themselves and it would be sent to a laboratory. <br/>Speaking of the experience on 19 September, she messaged Mr Hancock: \"So my mystery shopping shows the system is definitely working, at least for some.\"<br/>Mr Hancock enthusiastically replied \"for MOST!\", despite UK labs struggling to keep up with demand and people being asked to travel hundreds of miles to get tested. <br/>Mr Hancock clashed with Sir Gavin over whether to close schools ahead of their return January 2021. <br/>In private WhatsApp messages with a special adviser, he said he had to take \"rear guard action\" to ensure schools did not open, while the then-education secretary was battling to keep children in school. <br/>During a meeting on Zoom on 28 December 2020 to decide on the fate of students, Mr Hancock and his special adviser Emma Dean appeared to send each other messages commenting on the call, according to the Telegraph. <br/>Ms Dean said: He's [Sir Gavin] freaking out. You can tell he isn't being wholly rational.\"<br/>Mr Hancock got his way as schools closed days later amid a national lockdown.<br/>In an earlier exchange in September the pair took aim at Sir Gavin following the education secretary being forced to abandon A-level and GCSE students being given grades by algorithm. <br/>Replying to Ms Dean's suggestion Gavin looked awful and questioning if the education secretary was OK, Mr Hancock said: \"He needs a haircut and a holiday somewhere other than Scarborough!\"<br/>During the May 2020 drive to hit the 100,000 tests per day target, trucks full were bought from Amazon.<br/>Mr Hancock was worried the government could look \"flaky\" if it was accused of using them to pad the stats.<br/>But there was jubilation when the target was hit - not least from Gina Coladangelo, the aide with whom Mr Hancock had an affair.<br/>She messaged: \"Drinks cold in fridge at [Department for Health]. Feel free to open them before we are back [beer emoji]\".<br/>But problems continued. Mr Johnson admitted in June he was \"going quietly crackers\" over capacity, asking \"what is wrong with us as a country that we can't fix this?\".<br/>In September, Mr Hancock was advised to avoid an interview with Andrew Neil \"because he could go hard on testing\".<br/>One set of messages shows Boris Johnson getting in a muddle over statistics.<br/>He flagged a Financial Times article stating the global case fatality rate had fallen below 0.04. Mr Johnson wanted to know why the British death rate appeared to be much higher at 4%.<br/>Chief scientific officer Sir Patrick, chief medical officer Sir Chris, aide Dominic Cummings, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case and Mr Hancock all chipped in.<br/>When Mr Vallance eventually pointed out the FT figure is a probability, not a percentage, the PM replied \"Eh\" followed by another message reading simply \"?\".<br/>He offers \"five marks\" to whoever can explain the difference and asks them to \"show working\" - before Mr Cummings assures him it is a \"common confusion\".<br/>In the same exchange, Mr Johnson says he \"knows what I would prefer\" if he was 80 and given a choice between exposure to Covid-19 and \"destroying the economy\".<br/>A collection of more than 100,000 messages sent between former Health Secretary Matt Hancock and other ministers and officials at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic have been obtained by the Telegraph.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) has been studying coronaviruses in bats for over a decade.<br/>The institute is a 40-minute drive from the Huanan wet market where the first cluster of infections emerged.<br/>Those who entertain the theory say it could have leaked from a WIV lab and spread to the wet market. Most argue it would have been an unaltered virus collected from the wild, rather than engineered.<br/>The controversial theory first emerged early on in the pandemic, and was promoted by then-US President Donald Trump. Some even suggested it could have been engineered as a possible biological weapon.<br/>While many in the media and politics dismissed these as conspiracy theories at the time, others called for more consideration of the possibility. The idea has persisted, despite many scientists pointing out there is no evidence to back it up.<br/>A classified US intelligence report - saying three researchers at the Wuhan laboratory were treated in hospital in November 2019, just before the virus began infecting humans in the city - began circulating in US media in 2021.  <br/>But it was reported the Biden administration had shut down a state department investigation, set up by President Trump, into the lab-leak theory.<br/>\"That possibility certainly exists, and I am totally in favour of a full investigation of whether that could have happened,\" Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, told a US Senate committee hearing in May 2021.<br/>President Biden says he asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office in 2021, \"including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident\".<br/>In May 2021, Mr Biden ordered intelligence officials to \"redouble\" their efforts on this.<br/>The issue is still hotly contested.<br/>A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation was supposed to get to the bottom of it, but many experts believed it produced more questions than answers.<br/>A team of WHO-appointed scientists flew to Wuhan in early 2021 on a mission to investigate the source of the pandemic. After spending 12 days there, which included a visit to the laboratory, the team concluded the lab-leak theory was \"extremely unlikely\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Dr Peter Daszak: \"Our focus needs to shift to those supply chains to the (Huanan Seafood) Market\"<br/>But many have since questioned their findings. <br/>A prominent group of scientists criticised the WHO report for not taking the lab-leak theory seriously enough - it was dismissed in a few pages of a several-hundred-page report.<br/>\"We must take hypotheses about both natural and laboratory spillovers seriously until we have sufficient data,\" the scientists wrote in Science Magazine.<br/>They're not the only experts who called for the laboratory leak to be looked at more closely.<br/>Even the WHO's own director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for a new investigation, saying: \"All hypotheses remain open and require further study.\"<br/>And Dr Fauci said in 2021 he was \"not convinced\" the virus originated naturally. That was a shift from a year earlier, when he thought it most likely Covid had spread from animals to humans.<br/>China has hit back at suggestions the virus may have escaped from a laboratory by calling it a smear. State media have consistently accused the US government and Western media of spreading rumours about the source of the pandemic.<br/>Responding to Mr Wray's remarks, China's foreign ministry spokesperson accused US intelligence agencies of politicising the investigation into the origins of the virus.<br/>The US intelligence community had a history of \"misdeeds\" involving \"fraud and deception\", Mao Ning told a press briefing. As such, she said, their conclusions regarding the origins of Covid-19 had no credibility.<br/>China has pushed another theory, suggesting the coronavirus may have entered Wuhan in food shipments of frozen meat from elsewhere in China or South-East Asia. <br/>The Chinese government has also pointed to research published by one of its leading virologists into samples collected from bats in a remote, abandoned mine. <br/>Prof Shi Zhengli - often referred to as \"China's Batwoman\" - a researcher at the Wuhan Institute, published a report in 2021 revealing that her team had identified eight coronavirus strains found on bats in the mine in China in 2015. The paper says that coronaviruses from pangolins pose more of an immediate threat to human health than the ones her team found in the mine.<br/>Added to this is an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory long pushed by Chinese propagandists - and repeated by Mao Ning at the foreign ministry briefing on 1 March 2023 - suggesting  the coronavirus was made and leaked from Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, about 80km (50 miles) north of Washington DC.<br/>Once the centre of the US biological weapons programme, Fort Detrick currently houses biomedical labs researching viruses including Ebola and smallpox.<br/>Yes, and it's called the \"natural origin\" theory.<br/>This argues the virus spread naturally from animals, without the involvement of any scientists or laboratories.<br/>Supporters of the natural origin hypothesis say Covid-19 emerged in bats and then jumped to humans, most likely through another animal, or \"intermediary host\".<br/>This video can not be played<br/>Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more?<br/>That idea was backed by the WHO report, which said it was \"likely to very likely\" that Covid had made it to humans through an intermediate host.<br/>This hypothesis was widely accepted at the start of the pandemic, but as time has worn on, scientists have not found a virus in either bats or another animal that matches the genetic make-up of Covid-19, leading some to doubt the theory.<br/>Nevertheless, following FBI Director Wray's remarks, many scientists who have studied the virus have stressed there is no new scientific evidence pointing to a lab leak.<br/>A natural origin is still the more likely theory, said Professor David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow.<br/>\"There's been an accumulation of evidence (what we know about the viruses biology, the close variants circulating in bats and locations of early human cases) that firmly points to a natural origin centred on the Huanan market in Wuhan city,\" he said.<br/>Prof Alice Hughes from the University of Hong Kong agreed. She said the US Department of Energy's conclusion that the virus was most likely the result of a lab leak in Wuhan \"appears not to be based on new evidence, and remains the weaker of the two main hypothesis of the origin of the virus\". <br/>Given the massive human toll of the pandemic - with the recorded deaths of about 6.9 million people worldwide - most scientists think understanding how and where the virus originated is crucial to prevent it happening again.<br/>If the \"zoonotic\" theory is proved correct, it could affect activities such as farming and wildlife exploitation. In Denmark, fears about the spread of the virus through mink farming led to millions of mink being culled.<br/>But there would also be big implications for scientific research and international trade if theories related to a laboratory leak or frozen food chains were confirmed. <br/>Any confirmation of a leak may also affect how the world views China, which has already been accused of hiding crucial early information about the pandemic, and place further strain on US-China relations.<br/>\"From day one China has been engaged in a massive cover-up,\" Jamie Metzl, a fellow at the Washington-based Atlantic Council who has been pushing for the lab-leak theory to be looked into, told the BBC in 2021<br/>\"We should be demanding the full investigation of all origin hypotheses that's required.\"<br/>But others have cautioned against pointing the finger at China too quickly.<br/>\"We do need to be a bit patient but we also need to be diplomatic. We can't do this without support from China. It needs to be a no-blame environment,\" Prof Dale Fisher, of Singapore's National University Hospital, told the BBC.<br/>China hits back as US revisits Covid lab theory<br/>Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO<br/>Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

That figure is three times higher than officially recorded deaths from the disease.<br/>Separate analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates about 15 million excess deaths due to coronavirus over a similar period.<br/>Nearly every nation in the world is now administering vaccines and publishing rollout data, while at least 157 countries and territories have moved on to booster jabs. <br/>The map below, using figures collated by Our World in Data - a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity - shows the total number of doses given per 100 people, mostly first doses.<br/>According to that data, more than 64% of people have been fully vaccinated on every continent apart from Africa, where the figure is about 20%.<br/>\n                        Percent of people fully vaccinated\n                    <br/>\n                            Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive\n                        <br/>\n                    This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place. \n                <br/>\n                    Source: Our World in Data\n                <br/>\n                    Last updated: 5 July 2022, 13:28 BST\n                <br/>Some countries have secured more vaccine doses than their populations need, while other lower-income countries are relying on a global plan known as Covax, which is seeking to ensure everyone in the world has access to a vaccine. <br/>Of those countries that have moved on to booster campaigns, Chile, Uruguay and Singapore have currently vaccinated the highest proportion of people. <br/>Daily global cases fell after a spike in the spring but are now rising again, with the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of the Omicron variant.<br/>Studies suggest that Omicron - which quickly became dominant in numerous countries - is milder than the Delta variant, but far more contagious. The subvariants are even more contagious. <br/>Asia<br/>Asia, which was the centre of the initial outbreak that spread from Wuhan in China in early 2020, shows a mixed picture.<br/>North Korea, which admitted its first Covid infections in May of this year, has now seen 4.75 million symptomatic \"fever cases\" according to the state news agency. <br/>China appears to have recovered from a recent spike which earlier saw thousands of cases reported each day and millions of people placed under lockdown in large cities such as Shanghai. However, a fresh outbreak appears to be under way in eastern Anhui Province.<br/>In Japan, after two years of closure the government reopened its borders to visitors from 98 countries and regions but with strict limitations. <br/>It marked the most significant moment so far in the country's slow relaxation of its Covid-19 entry restrictions.<br/>Europe<br/>Reported daily cases are rising in several European countries, due to the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Testing is also now more limited than at previous points in the pandemic.<br/>In the UK, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show a 32% jump in infections last week. Hospitalisations are also increasing. <br/>North America<br/>The US has recorded 87 million cases and more than a million deaths - the highest figures in the world. <br/>However, daily cases and death counts have now fallen to lower levels than during much of the pandemic. <br/>Latin America<br/>Latin America is seeing some pockets of rising cases, though infections are at low levels among the countries which were hardest hit previously.<br/>Mexico and Guatemala are among countries seeing a rise in June.<br/>Brazil has been the worst-hit country in the region overall, recording more than 32 million cases and 672,000 deaths - the world's second-highest official death toll. <br/>In Peru, there have been over 213,000 deaths and the country has the world's highest number of deaths by population size - more than 657 deaths for every 100,000 people.<br/>Africa<br/>Africa has seen more than 12 million cases and 255,000 deaths - but the true extent of the pandemic across the continent is not known as testing rates are low.<br/>According to the official figures, South Africa has been the worst-hit country with more than 4 million confirmed cases and more than 100,000 deaths. <br/>South Africa was the first country to identify the new Omicron variant and it led to a sharp increase in infections - the fourth wave of infections in the country.<br/>Middle East<br/>Several countries in the Middle East have seen severe outbreaks of the virus since the pandemic began, though levels are currently at their lowest this year.<br/>The official death toll in Iran, the region's worst-hit country, is more than 140,000 and it has seen over seven million confirmed cases. <br/>Neighbouring Iraq has seen 25,000 deaths and in excess of two million confirmed cases.<br/>In January Israel was hit by the Omicron wave seen across the world, but infections have now come down. Its vaccination rollout has been highly successful at minimising the number of hospitalisations and deaths in the country. <br/>Oceania<br/>Early in the pandemic, Australia and New Zealand were widely praised for their response to Covid but both saw an increase in cases at the start of the year. <br/>So far, Australia has seen more than 8 million confirmed cases, with spikes in January and April. It has also recorded more than 10,000 confirmed deaths due to coronavirus.<br/>Daily cases are rising in New Zealand following a fall. So far it recorded 1.3 million cases, but only 1,535 deaths.<br/>In early May the country opened its borders to international visitors for the first time in two years.<br/>Covid-19 was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019 but the outbreak spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.<br/>It was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020.<br/>A pandemic is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. <br/>The data used on this page comes from a variety of sources. It includes figures collated by Johns Hopkins University as well as national governments and health agencies.<br/>When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind that not all governments are recording coronavirus cases and deaths in the same way. This makes like for like comparisons between countries difficult.<br/>Other factors to consider include: different population sizes, the size of a country's elderly population or whether a particular country has a large amount of its people living in densely-populated areas. In addition, countries may be in different stages of the pandemic.<br/>The map, table and animated bar chart in this page use a different source for the UK from that used by Johns Hopkins University.

More than 49 million - 85% of over-12s - have had both doses.<br/>While uptake of first and second doses dropped off late last year, there was a steep rise in people having boosters.

The more Covid that is circulating, the more chance there is for the virus to mutate. <br/>But new variants can pop up anywhere - the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India have all been the likely origins of previous variants of concern.<br/>So will the new Covid test restrictions make any difference?<br/>Several countries are asking travellers from China to produce a negative Covid test in order to gain entry. <br/>The US said this would \"slow the spread\" of the virus, while scientists worked to identify any potential variants that may emerge. But no-one is suggesting that this will stop Covid cases coming in. <br/>Italy has gone further, and is imposing mandatory post-arrival PCR tests on travellers from China. Those that test positive will need to quarantine for several days. <br/>This has the advantage of enabling genomic sequencing of the virus, and so aids the search for new variants. But it will also add to airport congestion.   <br/>Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that those travellers from China who have tested positive so far are carriers of \"Omicron variants already present in Italy\". Italy wants an EU-wide approach on the issue - but the EU's disease agency says, for many reasons, that is \"unjustified\".<br/>In the UK, there is plenty of Covid about. Probably well over a million people a week are getting infected, either at work, home or socialising - in other words anywhere people gather. The latest ONS survey estimated that around 1 in 45 people had the virus earlier this month.<br/>But most of the UK population is very well protected from severe illness, via a combination of vaccines and repeated natural infection.<br/>That means Covid - while still a potential danger here - is no longer the threat it once was.  <br/>This video can not be played<br/>Watch: Hope and worry as Beijing relaxes zero-Covid policy<br/>How many Covid cases are there in China?<br/>US demands Covid tests for visitors from China<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.

The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. <br/>There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. <br/>The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave.<br/>They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe.<br/>They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants.<br/>Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. <br/>In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. <br/>Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. <br/>Australia has reported cases too.<br/>Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. <br/>Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall.<br/>But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily.<br/>This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. <br/>Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.<br/>BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. <br/>A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths.<br/>As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. <br/>Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. <br/>They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. <br/>Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. <br/>Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested.<br/>Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. <br/>Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. <br/>If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. <br/>The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. <br/>How many people have had boosters so far?<br/>Covid map: Where are cases the highest?<br/>Rescue teams race to find five people missing on Titanic sub<br/>Watch: Inside Titanic sub before it went missing.
