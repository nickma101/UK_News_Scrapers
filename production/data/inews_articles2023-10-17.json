At the same time, we are all grown up enough to continue to enjoy the films we love with appropriate insight. As a feminist whose favourite film, no question, is , I feel comfortable with articulating this position.  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "As Curtis said to his daughter, nobody at the time felt that any of these unsavoury references were malicious. This is, of course, part of the problem with them. The women internalising the fact that Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as Bridget Jones was \u201ca little bit fat\u201d as a size 10 didn\u2019t think it was malicious, either \u2013 they thought it must mean they were fat, and that that was bad. But it\u2019s also true that these movies were part of a broader landscape: one in which women were under intense pressure to be thin and to get married, and, to speak to broader matters of \u201cdiversity\u201d, where having an accent like Hugh Grant\u2019s in was inherently charming. As for the \u201cinappropriate boss behaviour\u201d: I need not point out that sometimes, in films, people are murdered, nor that Grant\u2019s flirting in  is a deliberate object of humour and sexiness, nor that Bridget Jones specifically flirts with her boss, Daniel Cleaver (also played by Grant), by asking: \u201cHow dare you sexually harass me in this impertinent manner\u201d. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is clear, therefore, that much of these so-called indiscretions were satirical, or at least self-aware; reading them kindly, they were observations of the very real standards they were subjected to at the time. When films age they become artefacts, vignettes of the period in which they were made, that can be enjoyed or not according to audience choice. When I watch , or , I am aware that I\u2019m watching something made 20 years ago, that it\u2019s going to be very middle class, that it\u2019s going to have a posh, rogueish male lead, and that its female cast are going to be hung up on love and body image \u2013 in the same way that when I read a Jane Austen novel, I know that its characters are going to be a lot more concerned about finding a husband by age 23 and getting a dowry than it would be acceptable to be in 2023.

Spoiler alert: old ones rarely meet those criteria.
