The story is told through the eyes of Alice, a 30-something socially detached near-genius slacker, who hates her job, has an imaginary friend and communicates with her mother in Morse code. In the not-so-distant future New Zealand, where rich \u201cwealthugees\u201d fleeing a global climate crisis are buying land, violence and protests are rife on the streets, food prices are spiralling upwards and water is rationed, lazy Alice remains apathetic and remote. But when the mysterious 15-year-old Erika \u2013 clever, assertive and capable \u2013 suddenly enters her life, Alice is swept up into the terrifying pursuit of radical change. McDougall\u2019s humour, pointed social observations and shocking plot twists combine with moving insights on self-knowledge, family and friendship to make this a darkly compelling and enjoyable tale.8/10(Review by Tom Pilgrim)"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "3. Murder On The Dance Floor by Shirley Ballas is published in hardback by HQ on October 12, priced \u00a318.99 (ebook \u00a39.99).\u00a0"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Shirley Ballas uses her expert knowledge as head judge on Strictly Come Dancing to write a gripping debut novel about violence, death and sex in the not-so genteel world of ballroom dancing. The book takes a dramatic twirl when a promising young Eastern European female dancer drops down dead mid tango \u2013 and dance legend Lily Richmond turns to former student Susie Cooper, now a private detective, to solve what she is convinced is a murder. The dance detective duo delve deeper into the competitive world of dancing to try to unmask a killer who is keeping two quick steps ahead of them. In an impressive switch of skills from the so-called Queen of Latin Ballroom, the book will delight lovers of crime novels \u2013 and probably shock Strictly fans.8/10(Review by Alan Jones)"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "4.

Starting with the often violent \u201cart of succession\u201d, Beard masterfully navigates the traitorous historical evidence, using both fact and fiction to shed light on key aspects of the emperor\u2019s role and daily life, from his palace and official job description, all the way down to the nitty gritty of his deadly dinner parties, sexual fantasies and medicine cabinet. Many of the questions raised by Beard\u2019s historical excavation surrounding the endless struggle for power, self-serving narratives and the lost but important voices of slaves and women, still resonate today. The book appropriately ends with the emperors\u2019 alleged final words, which like much of what we know about the Romans, sound more like a theatre play than reality.8/10(Review by Tom Campbell)"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "5.

These are names that are traditionally seen as \u2018difficult\u2019 to pronounce in the West, but Ho emphasises the importance of getting it right (with a handy pronunciation guide at the end for those who need it). The sweeping lyricism of the book is matched by Khoa Le\u2019s sumptuous illustrations, transporting readers to different lands.

Few girls went to university, and married women in middle-class households were expected to stay at home. Medical and law schools discouraged young women; so did parliament, the seat of all decision-making, where a total of 38 women were elected as MPs before 1945.

Last month, a poll by Girlguiding found the happiness of girls and young women at its lowest level since 2009.
