Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA long-awaited merger of Vodafone and Three will bring \u201cthe biggest shake-up in the UK mobile market for over a decade,\u201d experts say \u2013 with significant consequences for all anyone in Britain using a device.The \u00a315bn deal will see the two firms combine to make one of Europe\u2019s biggest operators, with about 27 million customers and more than 11,500 staff.Margherita Della Valle, chief executive of Vodafone, called the deal a \u201cgame-changer\u201d that will create a more sustainable business that supports the cost of rolling out upgrades to 5G.RecommendedVodafone and Three are merging \u2013 is it time for a better mobile phone deal?But will it benefit customers or harm them? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about how the deal might shake up the mobile market.What is happening?Vodafone and Three \u2013\u00a0both relatively small phone networks in the UK \u2013\u00a0will merge, with Vodafone owning 51 per cent of the combined business. It\u2019s not clear yet what the new company will be called.Regulators still have to approve the deal, so the merger is not guaranteed.If it goes ahead, it will be completed before the end of 2024, the companies said.\u201cThis long-awaited megamerger represents the biggest shake-up in the UK mobile market for over a decade,\u201d said Kester Mann, director of consumer and connectivity at CCS Insight.Trade union Unite said the government \u201cmust step in and stop this reckless merger\u201d, arguing it will lead to job losses and push up bills.What does it mean for customers?The companies are looking to position the deal as great for their customers. They say that it will immediately lead to a \u201cbetter network experience with greater coverage and reliability at no extra cost, including through certain flexible, contract-free offers with no annual price increases, and social tariffs\u201d.Over the long term, it is not clear how the new company intends to bring those customers together. When EE and T-Mobile merged into EE, for instance, the two customer groups initially stayed separate and then gradually became integrated.Paul Carter, CEO of mobile intelligence provider GWS, said Vodafone and Three are \u201cboth lagging in terms of internet performance between broadband and mobile services,\u201d while \u201cVirgin Media O2 are currently leading the way in terms of the overall combined connectivity consumers\u2019 experience.\u201dHe added: \u201cOn paper, this merger makes sense for two companies looking to close the gap on competitors. However, it remains to be seen whether it will bring success.\u201dWhat does it mean for people who aren\u2019t Three or Vodafone customers?Those behind the merger argue that it will help everyone else, too. Della Valle insisted the merger is \u201cgreat for the country and great for competition\u201d, thanks to the \u00a311bn investment the new company has promised for the UK, to help \u201ccreate one of Europe\u2019s most advanced standalone 5G networks\u201d. It is argued that the mobile market will become more competitive with the presence of another large operator. In theory, that could lead to better prices and deals for everyone \u2013\u00a0though there is, of course, no guarantee of that.Will prices go up for existing or new customers?It\u2019s difficult to know this far out. Bigger companies have more power, which they can use to try and drive prices higher \u2013\u00a0but they also have more scale, which they can use to be more efficient and reduce prices.Both companies have recently increased prices significantly, above inflation, which might be a clue to how they intend to behave in the future. But they may argue that the deal would allow them to avoid similar rises in the future.This will be the question that regulators grapple with as they decide whether the deal should go ahead. If they cannot be convinced that the merger will lead to better conditions for customers, then they will look to stop it.Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said: \u201cReducing the number of network providers from four to three risks reducing the choices available to consumers, raising prices and lowering the quality of services available.\u201cThe Competition and Markets Authority needs to conduct a thorough assessment to determine whether this merger will be harmful to consumers.\u201dWill the deal go ahead?There is still a good chance that regulators will stop the deal from going ahead. They did the same when Three attempted to take over O2 in 2016, citing the risk that the deal would lead to higher prices.RecommendedBreakthrough could soon allow us to actually use quantum computers, scientists sayMajor finding boosts hope for finding alien life in our solar systemStrava responds to alarming report suggesting that it could be used to track you down\u201cThis will be a hard sale, given that both companies have been outperforming the market for the last year or so,\u201d said Paolo Pescatore, from PP Foresight.\u201cLet\u2019s see if the authorities have a change of heart. Both parties need to demonstrate that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and consumers for it to have a chance of getting over the line.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6489ff5c51ac3318d5fe4e68", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/independent-winner-drum-awards-b2357379.html", "primaryCategory": "Home News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The Independent crowned Brand of Year at Drum Awards for Online Media 2023", "lead": "<p>The Independent also picked up a Highly Commended award in the Publisher of the Year category</p>", "author": "Joe Middleton", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 17:04:21 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:56:44.087324", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T17:04:21+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/12/thumbnail_IMG_4923%20copy.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

No, because it\u2019s about trying to make sure that the budget is sustainable and that we can deliver proper, quality public services as we move forward in Northern Ireland that are sustainable and financially affordable,\u201d he said.Mr Heaton-Harris said the instruction to civil servants was to provide information to a future executive and he does not have the power to implement such revenue-raising measures.He did, however, say he will not rule anything out if the devolved government does not return.\u201cI do have the powers to go to consultation on some of these matters in the future but I do not have the power to ask for revenue to be raised in Northern Ireland,\u201d he said.\u201cI actually truly believe that should be something that locally elected politicians should do.\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t rule out anything for the future if there was no executive in place.\u201dMr Heaton-Harris is currently in negotiations with the DUP in relation to the restoration of the

would be beneficial for everybody, which is when the executive is up and running and local decisions are being made by local people,\u201d he said\u201cBut it has its frustrations too.\u201dMr Heaton-Harris confirmed on Wednesday he has used new powers provided through passage of the Northern Ireland (Interim Arrangements) Act 2023 for the first time to request information and advice on the revenue-raising measures.His letter said he asked for information on measures such as introducing domestic water charges and drug prescription charges and increasing tuition fees.There is currently no charge to the public for medical prescriptions in the region and Northern Ireland students who study at local universities pay \u00a34,630 a year in tuition fees, compared with a maximum of \u00a39,250 in England.When asked about the impact of water and prescription charges on poorer households, Mr Heaton-Harris said the \u201copportunities and costs\u201d of revenue-raising procedures will be evaluated.\u201cI mean, it would be much better if we did have an executive to be doing this and actually this information will be useful to any future executive in any choices that it might want to make,\u201d he said.\u201cBut, you know, these are important elements to understand that get a feeling for what can be raised, how it can be raised, what are the benefits and costs, opportunities and costs of doing any of these benefits \u2013 or all of them?\u201d\n\nAnd if you want a prosperous city of your nation's capital it needs to expand and bring in the wealth and bring

I was obviously fragile. How could they do that to someone?\u201dHer barrister David Sherborne previously said Mr Whitehouse and Ms Wightman, who have two daughters together, met at a very young age and married in 1992.The comedian, who rose to fame in The Fast Show comedy TV programme, later formed a relationship with a work colleague who became pregnant, the court was told.Ms Wightman and Mr Whitehouse separated in 2000 and were divorced three years later.In his evidence in support of his ex-wife\u2019s claim, Mr Whitehouse described the intrusion Ms Wightman faced as \u201cbeyond belief\u201d.The comedian later alleged that MGN journalists were monitoring the landline of their family home in north London.\u201cIt is disturbing. MGN\u2019s journalists were digging into Fiona, myself and our family members, who had nothing to do with anything,\u201d Mr Whitehouse said.Mr Whitehouse later said: \u201cIt is called a private life for a reason \u2026 MGN\u2019s journalists overstepped the mark.\u201dMs Wightman is bringing her claim against the publisher over two Daily Mirror articles, including one from October 2000 which her lawyers say involved journalists unlawfully obtaining \u201chighly private details surrounding the breakdown of her marriage to Mr Whitehouse\u201d.In her written evidence, she described the first piece, published on October 30 2000, as an \u201cextremely intrusive article about the breakdown of my relationship\u201d.Ms Wightman added: \u201cIt took years for me to regain my confidence. I was trying to get strong again and for MGN to publish something like this \u2013 so incredibly private \u2013 at a time when I was trying to recover my health really is despicable.\u201dDiscussing the second article about the couple\u2019s separation, published in April 2002, Ms Wightman said: \u201cAt the time, I was livid and heartbroken. But I certainly would not have said that to the press. Paul took care of us; he was funny and kind, and still is.\u201dAndrew Green, for MGN, told Ms Wightman the publisher had admitted \u201cthere were a number of occasions when journalists instructed private investigators to obtain your personal information unlawfully\u201d.He added that MGN \u201cunreservedly apologises\u201d for this, adding: \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have happened, it did and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201dHowever, Mr Green said there was \u201csimply no evidence whatsoever\u201d that Ms Wightman\u2019s voicemails were intercepted, adding of Mr Whitehouse that there was also \u201cno evidence that he was ever hacked\u201d.MGN also say Ms Wightman\u2019s claim has been brought too late.The court heard Ms Wightman was told about her ex-husband\u2019s relationship with another woman in 1998, with the barrister suggesting MGN journalists were \u201cnot particularly quick\u201d to learn about the separation.\u201cMr Whitehouse having an affair and a child with another woman would have been a very much bigger story,\u201d he said.He said the October 2000 article \u201cgets the reason for the separation entirely wrong\u201d, adding that \u201cif MGN\u2019s journalists had intercepted your voicemails at this time they would have been writing a very different article\u201d.Ms Wightman\u2019s case is one of four representative claims being heard in London, alongside similar claims brought by the Duke of Sussex, Coronation Street actor Michael Turner, known professionally as Michael Le Vell, and Hollyoaks actress Nikki Sanderson."}, {"_id": "6489ff5d51ac3318d5fe4e6f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/police-scotland-durham-constabulary-northumbria-police-angela-constance-county-durham-b2357343.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Police Scotland appoints first female chief constable", "lead": "Jo Farrell, who is currently in charge of Durham Constabulary, will succeed Sir Iain Livingstone.", "author": "Neil Pooran", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 16:28:11 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:56:45.812826", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T16:28:11+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/12/66d0415c4fb4df5a4d40b88885e7750cY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2ODI2Njc1-2.44763682.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Bars and pubs could only serve alcohol alongside \u201csubstantial\u201d meals.Sources said the Tory-majority Privileges Committee, chaired by Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman, had signed off on its report into Mr Johnson and will publish on Thursday morning.They have investigated whether Mr Johnson committed a contempt of Parliament by misleading MPs either recklessly or deliberately by denying rule-breaking parties in No 10.The former prime minister was himself fined by the Metropolitan Police, which issued 126 fixed-penalty notices for Covid breaches across Downing Street and Whitehall.Mr Johnson has railed against the committee he has criticised as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d and stood down as an MP on Friday after receiving their findings.The former Conservative leader\u2019s resignation means he will not serve the lengthy suspension likely to be recommended.If it was at least 10 days and approved by the Commons, then a by-election in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency could have been triggered.Instead, his constituents will go to the polls next month in a major electoral challenge for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak because of the resignation.\n\nThis a typical distraction tactic from Boris Johnson that doesn't change the fact he broke the law and lied about it.Daisy Cooper, Liberal Democrat Deputy LeaderMr Johnson\u2019s ally Nigel Adams also resigned and his arch-supporter Nadine Dorries has announced she will quit as an MP too.The former prime minister has publicly clashed with Mr Sunak, accusing him of \u201ctalking rubbish\u201d over his resignation honours list.Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Daisy Cooper said: \u201cThis a typical distraction tactic from Boris Johnson that doesn\u2019t change the fact he broke the law and lied about it.RecommendedPrincess of Wales to reopen National Portrait GalleryJunior doctors join picket lines over \u2018unbearable\u2019 working conditionsIn Pictures: UK swelters as hot weather continues \u2013 for now\u201cThe Conservative Party is now in a full blown civil war, while people struggle to afford to pay their mortgage or get a GP appointment.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman accused of posing as a man to prey on a short-sighted teenage girl has been found guilty of sexual assault by kissing and cleared of 16 other sex offences.Georgia Bilham, 21, was cleared by a jury of all but one of the alleged offences after about three hours of deliberations following an eight-day trial.She made no reaction as the verdicts were delivered at Chester Crown Court on Wednesday.Judge Michael Leeming told Bilham: \u201cYou have been convicted of count one, an allegation of sexual assault.\u201cI\u2019m going to adjourn sentencing for a pre-sentence report to be prepared.\u201cIt should not be taken by you as an indication of a non-custodial sentence \u2013 all options are open.\u201dBilham, from Alpraham, Cheshire, will have to sign the sex offenders register and will be sentenced on July 19.Her trial was told she created an online Snapchat persona in the name of George Parry to trick the 19-year-old complainant into thinking she was a man.\u2018George\u2019 always wore a hood over his head, even in bed, while with the teenager, who, the court was told, is severely short-sighted.\u2018George\u2019 claimed to be \u201cparanoid\u201d because of his involvement with Albanian gangsters.\n\nI think they told her I was female. It was not George, it was GeorgiaDefendant on police officer called to crashBilham said after the first time they met in person the complainant messaged her to say, \u201cThere\u2019s something weird about you,\u201d and blocked her on Snapchat.But there continued to be an online \u201clove-hate relationship\u201d, which became \u201ctoxic\u201d at times, the court heard.Bilham said she believed her cover was blown after crashing her mother\u2019s car into a hedge while out for a drive with the teenager on May 11 2021.Jurors convicted her of sexually assaulting the girl by kissing her that evening.Bilham told jurors she believes a police officer called to the scene revealed her true identity to the complainant after checking her driving licence.She said: \u201cI think they told her I was female. It was not George, it was Georgia.\u201dThe defendant said from that point she believes the teenager knew she was really a woman.Giving evidence, the complainant\u2019s mother said her daughter told her about seeing someone called George, who she said had social anxiety so kept his hood up.Bilham admitted being caught up in a \u201cweb of lies\u201d but denied getting a \u201cbuzz\u201d out of deceiving the teenager, maintaining throughout that she thought the woman she had sex with believed she was a woman.She told the court she had been \u201ca bit of a tomboy\u201d when she was younger and had a difficult relationship with her mother after her parents split when she was a teenager.\n\nIt was a way of not being meBilhamBilham said she never wanted to change gender but questioned her sexuality and that her mother would \u201cnot be happy\u201d if she was in a same-sex relationship.Asked why she set up the fake Snapchat account pretending to be a boy, Bilham replied: \u201cI just was not happy in myself. I just\u2026 it was just more like an escape. I don\u2019t know.\u201cI was not confident in myself. It was a stupid thing to do.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFour British women who accuse Andrew Tate of violent sexual and physical assaults are planning to launch legal action against the misogynistic influencer.Lawyers representing the alleged victims delivered a legal letter to Mr Tate, a former kickboxing world champion turned \u201csuccess coach\u201d, at his home on the outskirts of the Romanian capital of Bucharest where he is under house arrest for separate alleged sex and trafficking crimes, on Wednesday morning.The letter outlines allegations made by the four women, including violent rapes, serious physical assaults, as well as controlling and coercive behaviour, with the women claiming they endured injuries and psychiatric damage.Jack Beeston, an associate at McCue Jury & Partners, a UK law firm behind the pending legal action, told The Independent: \u201cMr Tate refused to accept delivery of the legal letter so we posted it through the gate so it was left on his premises. It was translated to us by a Romanian journalist that Mr Tate was instructing his security guard to tell us to f*** off.\u201dRecommendedWoman claims Andrew Tate said he \u2018wanted to kill her\u2019 after sexFigures that lay bare the shocking scale of toxic influencer Andrew Tate\u2019s reach among young menOne in four young men agree with Andrew Tate\u2019s views on women, poll findsA spokesperson for Mr Tate told The Independent the influencer \u201ccategorically denies the veracity of the accusations\u201d brought by lawyers on behalf of the women.The alleged victims told Mr Tate that - depending on how he answers - legal proceedings will be initiated against him at London\u2019s High Court in forthcoming weeks.Two of the women claim they were recruited for Mr Tate\u2019s webcam business, while the other women allege they had personal relationships with him.One claimant said: \u201cWhile this experience has been extremely traumatic for us, we have taken strength in the fact that we have decided to take a stand.\u201dRecommendedAndrew Tate: A timeline of his rise and fallHere\u2019s how to beat toxic men like Andrew TateIt comes after one of Mr Tate\u2019s alleged victims, involved in the pending civil legal action, who has accused him of raping and strangling her until she lost consciousness last week told The Independent she feared the social media star was going to kill her.The 30-year-old said Mr Tate told her he owned her and wanted to kill her after they had sex.Matthew Jury, a managing partner of McCue Jury & Partners, said: \u201cDespite Tate\u2019s outrageous claims that these women aren\u2019t even real, on reading the papers, he should now recall how real they are. Talk of the \u2018Matrix\u2019 and \u2018false flags\u2019 hold no weight in court. The survivors look forward to seeing him there.\u201dA spokesperson for Mr Tate highlighted that three of the women had filed criminal complaints that the UK authorities chose not to pursue, and questioned: \u201cWhat new evidence could have appeared nine years later that would overturn the court\u2019s decision?\u201dThe representative added: \u201cConsidering the collective approach of the four women, and the channels chosen for communications, the opportunistic character of this endeavour becomes obvious, as justice is sought in the court, not in the press.\u201dRecommendedAndrew Tate trial: Why Romania wants to remind the world the toxic influencer is BritishExperts warn of \u2018copycat Andrew Tates\u2019 as influence continues to grow from behind barsCourses for teachers on how to tackle Andrew Tate\u2019s views sell outThe spokesperson noted that \u201cdespite these alleged events taking place in 2014, no legal action has been taken to cover the alleged damages suffered and no proof of such damages has been brought forward until after Andrew became an international public figure.\u201dThe claimants involved in the proposed UK civil legal action, who are aged in their late twenties and early thirties, claim the offences occurred between 2013 and 2016 while the controversial influencer was based in Britain.McCue Jury & Partners have so far raised \u00a318,500 to fund court proceedings via crowdfunding. The victims hope police in the UK will reopen their investigation into Mr Tate.Mr Tate, who has been banned from a number of social media platforms for hate speech and voicing misogynistic views, was arrested in Romania in late December alongside his brother, Tristan Tate, and two other suspects. They are accused of human trafficking, rape and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.The influencer was released from jail with his younger brother at the beginning of April after they won an appeal to be held under house arrest.

None of them did, it\u2019s a tragedy.\u201dNottinghamshire Police said a 31-year-old man was tasered and arrested on suspicion of murder after the trio were stabbed to death.UoN\u2019s vice-chancellor, Professor Shearer West, said Ms O\u2019Malley-Kumar, 19, had been \u201cthriving in her first year of study\u201d \u2013 adding that she had been \u201cinspired to a career in medicine by work placements in a GP surgery and her volunteering for the nationwide vaccination programme during the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201dMs O\u2019Malley-Kumar\u2019s family described her as a \u201ctruly wonderful and beautiful young lady\u201d.In a statement, they said: \u201cGrace was an adored daughter and sister; she was a truly wonderful and beautiful young lady.\u201cGrace was not just a sister to James but his best friend. He is completely heartbroken. As parents, words cannot explain our complete and utter devastation. She will be so dearly missed.\u201cWe were so incredibly proud of Grace\u2019s achievements and what a truly lovely person she was.\u201cShe was resilient and wise beyond her years. Grace was so happy in life fulfilling her ambition of studying to become a doctor whilst playing top-flight hockey at university.\n\nAt 19 he was just at the start of his journey into adulthood and was developing into a wonderful young man. As parents we are enormously proud of everything he achieved and all the plans he had madeBarnaby Webber's parents\u201cShe leaves behind devastated extended family and friends.\u201dProf West said Mr Webber, also aged 19, had a \u201cparticular personal interest in geopolitics of both the USA and China\u201d \u2013 and that his tutors recalled \u201chis energy as a student and as fun, friendly and full of life\u201d in his seminars.After the pair were found unresponsive in Ilkeston Road, Mr Coates was found fatally knifed in Magdala Road before the suspect is believed to have stolen his van and driven at pedestrians in Milton Street.Three people were injured in the van attack, with one in a critical condition in hospital and two suffering minor injuries.According to reports, the suspect was a west African migrant who had settled in the UK legally and was known to police.It is understood the man has a mental health history.CCTV from a residential care home 100 yards from where Mr Coates was found, appearing to show a man dressed in black attempting to gain access to a bay window, is being examined by detectives.Alex Pridmore, a trustee of the All Saints Shelter charity, which runs the home, said the footage showed someone trying to gain access through a ground-floor window at about 4am on Tuesday.Mr Pridmore said a\u00a0male member of staff at the care home monitored the man seen near the window\u00a0until he had left the property.A resident at the home, who did not wish to be named, said he \u201cpunched\u201d the glass of his bay window to frighten off the man.Police confirmed investigations had revealed that a man \u201cmatching the description of the suspect\u201d had attempted to gain entry to a supported living complex in Mapperley Road but had been denied entry.The force said the incident was not reported to them at the time, and that they had not received any calls about the suspect before the first stabbing in Ilkeston Road.The family of Mr Webber, who played hockey, rugby and cricket for his school and local clubs and was a member of the combined cadet forces, previously said \u201ccomplete devastation is not enough to describe our pain\u201d \u2013 labelling his death as a \u201csenseless murder\u201d.In a statement to the PA news agency, Mr Webber\u2019s family said: \u201cBarnaby Philip John Webber was a beautiful, brilliant, bright young man, with everything in life to look forward to.\u201cAt 19 he was just at the start of his journey into adulthood and was developing into a wonderful young man.\u201cAs parents we are enormously proud of everything he achieved and all the plans he had made.\u201dBancroft\u2019s School, which Ms O\u2019Malley-Kumar attended until last year, said they were \u201cdesperately shocked and saddened\u201d by her death.The talented sportswoman played international hockey for both the under-16 and under-18 England hockey teams as well as the Essex under-15 women\u2019s team.Paying tribute to Mr Coates, Ross Middleton, executive headteacher of Huntingdon Academy and Warren Academy, said: \u201cIan was a much-loved colleague who always went the extra mile for the benefit of our children and will be greatly missed.\u201cAs a school community, it will take time to process this deeply upsetting news.\u201dIf police wish to hold the suspect in custody beyond Wednesday evening without charge they will need to apply to magistrates for permission.RecommendedSNP: Tories and Labour \u2018in denial\u2019 over Brexit link to cost-of-living crisisNHS modernisation \u2018urgent and

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe end of freedom of movement has not led to a significant increase in wages, Government advisers have said.A study of the agriculture, manufacturing, hospitality and transport sectors by the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) found few organisations had increased wages to compete for staff despite the smaller number of workers available after Brexit.In 2021, then-prime minister Boris Johnson argued that labour shortages following Britain\u2019s exit from the EU would be part of a transition to a \u201chigh-wage, high-skill\u201d economy, encouraging firms to invest in the domestic workforce.But the MAC study, published on Wednesday, found few businesses previously dependent on EU workers had increased wages beyond the amount required by the rising minimum wage or the cost of living.It said: \u201cOrganisations often felt unable to pass on the cost of higher wages to their customers and some felt that even with increased wages, they would still struggle to attract and retain the labour pool available to them.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveOffice for National Statistics\">Some, however, had increased wages for specific \u201ctedious\u201d positions or \u201cless desirable\u201d work such as night shifts.Others looked at improving working conditions by focusing more on employee wellbeing or adapting roles to meet the needs of staff, although this was easier in the hospitality sector than in transport, manufacturing or agriculture.Total job vacancies in the UK remain above one million, according to the Office for National Statistics, with figures published on Tuesday showing 1,051,000 vacancies between March and May 2023, in comparison there were 1.3 million unemployed people.Vacancies peaked at almost 1.3 million between April and June 2022 and have been steadily falling since.Wednesday\u2019s MAC report also found employers had sometimes struggled with alternative recruitment strategies.Agricultural businesses found the Seasonal Worker scheme, which allows workers to work in the UK for six months, was not a long-term solution due to the time and money spent training a new workforce every six months.The report said: \u201cHaving new waves of staff every six months meant they were constantly working at lower levels of productivity while new staff were being trained.\u201dEfforts to recruit UK workers had also had mixed results, with a younger and less experienced workforce requiring higher training costs and tough working conditions causing many to leave jobs within weeks.One logistics company told the MAC: \u201cOur core colleagues, 50% of them will leave before 12 weeks, and our agency partners, it\u2019s 80% leaving within 12 weeks. So it\u2019s getting to the point where you need to bring in 10 people to gain by three.\u201dOther businesses found UK applicants \u201cregularly\u201d did not turn up for interviews and had only showed interest for \u201ctick box benefits reasons\u201d.The MAC found automation had not been a \u201cpanacea\u201d either, with businesses finding the high cost of machinery meant the return on investment was limited.RecommendedNHS modernisation \u2018urgent and vital\u2019, shadow health secretary saysBoris Johnson demands Tory quits Privileges Committee on eve of partygate reportNottingham attacks: What we know about the incidents so farThe report added: \u201cOrganisations were unsurprisingly reluctant to reduce their levels of production.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDiscussions about changing and modernising the NHS are \u201ceven more urgent and vital\u201d due to the depth of the crisis the service is facing, shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has said.Speaking at the NHS ConfedExpo on Wednesday, Mr Streeting said \u201cpolitics is part of the problem\u201d.He added: \u201cEven if the NHS weren\u2019t in the midst of the worst crisis in its history, which it objectively is, and even if the public finances weren\u2019t in a terrible mess, which they are, my argument is that we would still need to be talking about how we build an NHS that\u2019s fit for the future \u2013 equipped to deal with the health needs and epidemiology of the Britain of 2048, not 1948.\u201cBut the depth of the crisis in our NHS and the state of the economy makes the conversation about change and modernisation even more urgent and vital.\u201d\n\nThe technology that exists today can instantly free up staff, make their working lives more bearable so they stay in the service, and deliver better, faster care for patients at the same timeWes StreetingRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveMr Streeting acknowledged there are \u201camazing opportunities available to the NHS now and in the coming years\u201d but called for technology to be upgraded to stop the health service \u201cbeing held back by creaking, outdated technology\u201d.It comes after Labour claimed almost 80,000 pagers are still being used in the NHS, despite former health secretary Matt Hancock saying in 2019 that the service would stop using the gadgets in 2021.Mr Streeting said: \u201cThere are now tools which can map radiation therapy onto cancer cells, avoiding organs more precisely than a radiologist working alone. And it does it in seconds, rather than the hour it takes a doctor. This is the standard technology used across the United States. But just one in three radiotherapy planning centres in England use this technology.\u201cThere are between one and two million mammograms done across the UK each year. 96% will not find cancer. But those women are currently left in the dark for weeks, or even months, waiting for the results. Why the hold-up? Because two clinicians are required to check them, and there is a workforce crisis.\u201cBut AI can rule out cancer-free scans in seconds, getting patients their results faster and freeing up clinicians to focus on the tests displaying abnormalities.\u00a0 This has been rolled out across Hungary since 2021, but not across the NHS.\u201cAI can help interpret chest X-rays, saving 15% of a radiologist\u2019s workload. When combined with interpretation by a consultant radiologist, it can reduce missed lung cancer cases by 60%. Yet to be fully adopted by the NHS.\u201dMr Streeting also said the future of the health service \u201cmust see more care taking place in the community\u201d to reduce the burden on hospitals, but \u201cslow adoption is working against that\u201d.Labour has committed to doubling medical school places and training 10,000 more nurses and midwives, which is said it will fund by abolishing the non-dom tax status.However, Mr Streeting said that \u201ccould take years\u201d.He added: \u201cThe technology that exists today can instantly free up staff, make their working lives more bearable so they stay in the service, and deliver better, faster care for patients at the same time.\u201dMr Streeting blamed a \u201cfailure from the top\u201d for keeping the health service in an \u201canalogue age\u201d.He said the Government \u201ccannot effectively reform the health service because it is unwilling, unable, and too distracted\u201d.Mr Streeting also called on Rishi Sunak to negotiate with junior doctors and said his \u201capproach has failed\u201d.RecommendedEnd of free movement did not increase wages, Government advisers sayBoris Johnson demands Tory quits Privileges Committee on eve of partygate reportNottingham attacks: What we know about the incidents so farIt comes as thousands of junior doctors started a 72-hour walk-out on Wednesday in a row over pay.He added: \u201cIt may suit the Conservatives to blame rising waiting lists on strikes, but it doesn\u2019t suit the NHS and it doesn\u2019t suit patients.

We now particularly have very strict requirements on duty of care.\u201cIn 2010/2011, Fremantle would have been dealing with the day-to-day and so (ITV\u2019s chief operations officer) Sarah Clarke put that through to Fremantle because they\u2019re the producer, and said: \u2018Actually, if Rebecca was going to meet with anybody, it should have been Fremantle.\u2019 They\u2019re still alive and well.\u201dDame Carolyn also noted that their duty of care requirements for third party producers has \u201cincreased significantly\u201d since 2019.\u201cThere would always be spot checks, there would always been people on the ground. But I think what we do now is systematic, from selection, to production, to post production \u2013 it\u2019s systematic and it\u2019s written down,\u201d she added.\u201cWe have a duty of care charter, we have a mental health advisory group, we have two medical professionals who work for us, both retained. We have an external advisor\u2026 So we have a huge, comprehensive process of duty of care and it\u2019s systematic.\u201dThe chief executive faced questions about the culture at ITV on Wednesday from MPs alongside Ms Mullins and ITV managing director Kevin Lygo after former This Morning host Phillip Schofield\u2019s exit.A spokesperson for X Factor said: \u201cDuty of care is of the utmost importance to us and we always take contributor welfare extremely seriously.\u201cDuring the 2010 series of The X Factor, there were robust measures in place to ensure everyone involved in the making of the programme was supported throughout their experience and beyond, including a dedicated welfare team made up of psychologists, doctors, welfare producers and independent legal and management advisers with no time limit on aftercare once the show had aired.RecommendedNottingham attacks: What we know about the incidents so farProbiotics may help treat people with depression taking antidepressants \u2013 studyWriter Douglas Stuart and athlete Laura Muir receive honorary degrees\u201cThese measures were under constant review and we have always been proactive in adapting and updating them for future series to reflect the requirements of the show.\u201dThey added that contestants did choose their own independent lawyers to represent them from a selection of leading industry music lawyers."}, {"_id": "6489ff6351ac3318d5fe4e85", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nottingham-taunton-university-of-nottingham-school-usa-b2357444.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The talented students and dedicated school caretaker killed in Nottingham attack", "lead": "Barnaby Webber, Grace Kumar and Ian Coates died in an attack in Nottingham on Tuesday.", "author": "Pa Reporters", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 14:57:37 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:56:51.980693", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T14:57:37+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/11/14103249-effa3f91-946f-47ab-9bdc-9460dd21d924.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

plan, health leaders said that they did not want to inhibit people with poor school grades entering the NHS and the plan would offer \u201calternative channel into professions for people with the talent\u201d.The health service is issuing a call to newly retired doctors to \u201ckeep caring\u201d by performing outpatient appointments in early retirement.Some 1,000 consultants retire from the NHS every year.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveFrom autumn they will be able to sign up to a new digital platform offering their ability either in person or virtually.\n\nThis digital tool will help us to match patients with retired doctors who we know are keen to stay working in a flexible wayAmanda Pritchard, NHS England chief executiveHospitals will be able to use the platform to find consultants they need to help provide care for patients and help cut down their waiting lists.It is also hoped the move will also crack down on expensive agency spend.NHS England said that more than four-fifths of people on the waiting list need an outpatient appointment such as a follow-up for cardiology or rheumatology \u2013 rather than a surgical procedure.Those requiring a face-to-face appointment or follow-up will be seen in the usual way, a spokesperson said.Speaking at the NHS Confed Expo conference in Manchester, Amanda Pritchard, NHS England chief executive, said: \u201cWe will set out how we want to keep people at the end of their career engaged in ways that work for them.\u201cThe experience of the pandemic showed the enormous value of returners in supporting the current workforce.\u201cAnd we have continued to bring back staff through the NHS Reservists Programme to respond to surges in demand or emergency situations when they arise.\u201cWe want to continue to provide routes to return for staff with the skills we need.\n\nCreating this new route back has the potential to help us see patients quicker, give regular doctors more time to spend on the most complex cases and give trusts an alternative to using expensive agency staffAmanda Pritchard, NHS England chief executive\u201cSo as part of that I can announce today that from this autumn, newly retired doctors will be offered the chance to keep caring and to continue tackling the elective backlog.\u201cA new digital platform will allow them to sign up to deliver outpatient appointments \u2013 either virtually or in person.\u201cLocal NHS trusts will be able to upload details of the patients that need to be seen and they will then be matched with doctors, based on their availability and area of expertise.\u201cCreating this new route back has the potential to help us see patients quicker, give regular doctors more time to spend on the most complex cases and give trusts an alternative to using expensive agency staff.\u201cBut just as importantly it gives our most experienced specialists the ability to keep on contributing to the NHS but in a way that fits far better around their lives.\u201dAn NHS spokesperson said that all \u201cappropriate checks\u201d will be carried out before newly-retired consultants become fully registered on the platform and they will need an active registration on the specialist register and the GMC registry.Meanwhile Ms Pritchard said that more work on the retention of staff was also important.\u201cWe can\u2019t invest in training and additional routes to bring more people into the health service if when they get here they find the conditions aren\u2019t right and they leave,\u201d she said.She said the much-anticipated NHS workforce plan would be published \u201csoon\u201d.\n\nWhile this new initiative is needed, 8% of medical posts in secondary care are currently vacant, and so the worry is that it could be little more than a sticking plaster for the much deeper workforce crisis that is hindering what the NHS can deliverDanny Mortimer, NHS EmployersDuring a recent visit to her old school in Durham she met children as young as 11 who expressed a desire to work in the NHS.Ms Pritchard said: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford for that wave of enthusiasm to crash against the closed door of insufficient places on medical or nursing courses.\u201cNeither can we afford for it to crash against a cliff face of high academic requirements if we can provide an alternative channel into professions for people with the talent and the drive to do those roles.\u201dThe NHS has already announced that the workforce plan will include an expansion of apprenticeship roles for both doctors and nurses.Commenting on the announcement, Danny Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, which is part of the NHS Confederation, said: \u201cThe NHS has already been working hard to clear the backlogs but concerted action is needed to help it go even further.\u201cWith demand so high and with 432,000 outpatient appointments having had to be cancelled or rescheduled because of the walkouts over the last six months, health leaders will welcome reinforcements in the form of retired medics rejoining the service to lend their support.\u201cThis is on top of flexibilities that the NHS offers already around retirement and working arrangements so that vital talent can be retained.\u201cWhile this new initiative is needed, 8% of medical posts in secondary care are currently vacant, and so the worry is that it could be little more than a sticking plaster for the much deeper workforce crisis that is hindering what the NHS can deliver.\u201cLeaders are eager to see how the Government will respond to this challenge in its imminent workforce plan.\u201dMeanwhile, Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told the conference that more must be done to create a \u201chealth strategy\u201d instead of \u201cNHS policies\u201d.In his keynote address to the conference, he said: \u201cWe need to have a health strategy, not just policies for the NHS.\u201cIf we are to thrive in the health service\u2026 we know we can\u2019t succeed unless we sort out the terrible crisis unfolding in social care; we know that we need action on smoking, on nutrition, on exercise; also the social determinants of health \u2013 housing.\u201cYesterday I was at the primary care practice down the road, the GP there said to me that in one in four of the people she sees, their problem is not actually a health problem, it is a housing problem.\u201dBut he said that the Government \u201cappears to be going in the wrong direction\u201d, adding: \u201cWe got promised a Health Disparities White Paper across Whitehall, we got promised a Mental Conditions Strategy across Whitehall, we have now got a Major Conditions

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA psychopathic hammer attacker has been jailed for at least 28 years for realising his \u201cdepraved fantasy\u201d to kill a random stranger in a Gothic graveyard.Erik Feld, 37, had a long-standing obsession with extreme violence before he killed Ranjith Kankanamalage in a premediated attack, the Old Bailey heard.Beforehand, Feld fed his fixation by buying a kitten in order to kill it and watching \u201csnuff films\u201d online of men and women being bludgeoned with hammers, the Old Bailey heard.In the early hours of August 16 2021, Feld hid in the shadows behind a monument in Tower Hamlets cemetery in east London before hitting his prey 12 times in the face and head with a claw hammer.The 50-year-old victim was found with catastrophic injuries by a member of the public on a path in cemetery park later the same morning.In his trial, Feld concocted what the judge described as a preposterous \u201ccock-and-bull\u201d story and launched a homophobic rant at the victim, who had an ex-wife and two children in Sri Lanka and an\u00a0ex-civil partner in the UK.Feld was found guilty of murder in March and, on Wednesday, Mr Justice Bryan jailed him for life with a minimum term of 28 years.The judge said it was an \u201chorrific and abhorrent\u201d murder.He said that Feld had picked a \u201ccreepy and Gothic\u201d setting because it fitted in with his long-standing desire to kill a stranger with a hammer and Mr Kankanamalage had the \u201csevere misfortune\u201d to encounter him.Mr Justice Bryan told Feld his \u201cselfish, callous, abhorrent actions carried out to fulfil your depraved fantasy\u201d had a devastating impact on Mr Kankanamalage\u2019s loved ones.\n\n(Mr Kankanamalage) was a senior bank manager in Sri Lanka, a very accomplished athlete who won gold medals and completed two degrees in Sri Lanka as well as academic courses in the UKMr Kankanamalage's daughter, HiruniThe judge agreed with barristers in the case that the starting point for sentencing was 25 years \u2013 rather than 30 years if murder was aggravated by hostility to his victim\u2019s sexual orientation.Feld had 10 previous convictions for 18 offences between 2002 to August 19 2021 including criminal damage, sex assault, battery and possession of an offensive weapon.Among the offences: he had brandished an axe at passengers on the London Underground and sprayed black paint on his face and the word \u201ckill\u201d on a Tube window, the court was told.Feld was arrested on August 20 2021 as he was awaiting sentence for waving a claw hammer outside a Poundland store two days after the killing.A search of his home in Tower Hamlets, east London, uncovered two mallets and a sledge hammer in a hallway cupboard, and a third mallet in a living-room cupboard.He was re-arrested in January 2022 after his DNA was found on bloodstained nail clippings from the left hand of his victim and he was spotted on CCTV footage in the area of the cemetery.In a fresh search of his flat, police found another hammer and a cut-throat razor by Feld\u2019s pillow.Prosecutor Paul Cavin KC read a series of victim impact statements, including one from the victim\u2019s daughter, Hiruni, on behalf of herself, her mother and younger brother who watched the sentencing by video link from Sri Lanka.She described him as a kind and friendly person with life-long love of learning and an ambition to qualify in accountancy.She said: \u201cHe was a senior bank manager in Sri Lanka, a very accomplished athlete who won gold medals and completed two degrees in Sri Lanka as well as academic courses in the UK.\u201dHe was hoping to apply to become a British citizen and resume his career in banking, she added: \u201cBefore his dream came true, he was brutally murdered.\u201dFormer civil partner John Kennedy told how he met Mr Kankanamalage at the Hilton Hotel in Heathrow where the victim was working at the time.He said the realisation of what happened to him \u201chit me like a ton of bricks\u201d and he was consumed be grief, depression and deep sadness.He also felt sad for Mr Kankanamalage\u2019s family in Sri Lanka, saying: \u201cThis was such a cruel and cowardly attack on a gentle and kind man who was just chilling in the park.\u201dIn mitigation, Andrew Morris highlighted Feld\u2019s \u201csevere personality disorder\u201d.The defendant\u2019s mother died when he was aged 11, he had no relationship with his father and grew up in an \u201cabusive household\u201d, Mr Morris said.Feld stood with his arms crossed in the dock and made no reaction as he was sent down.Detective Chief Superintendent James Conway, of Scotland Yard, said: \u201cErik Feld\u2019s actions demonstrated a brutal low of humanity, but the response of the communities across Tower Hamlets following Ranjith\u2019s murder showed the opposite \u2013 people coming together to support each other, with the aim of ensuring the person responsible for this attack was brought to justice.\u201cFrom the outset, our officers investigated this as if it were a hate crime, but throughout the police investigation Feld has never disclosed why he attacked Ranjith with such force. He is clearly a violent and dangerous man and, as demonstrated by comments made during his trial, one who is fuelled by homophobia.\u201dJulius Capon, head of CPS London Homicide, said: \u201cIn this case, the CPS and Metropolitan Police Service gave careful consideration as to whether we had sufficient evidence to prove that this offence came within the definition of homophobic aggravation for the purposes of sentencing. All agreed that we could not prove that Feld\u2019s actions were either motivated by homophobic hostility or that such hostility was demonstrated at the time of committing the offence.\u201dLutfur Rahman, executive mayor of Tower Hamlets, said: \u201cI hope today\u2019s sentence brings some comfort and justice to the friends and family of Ranjith Kankanamalage, whose violent murder deeply affected the community in Tower Hamlets and beyond.\u201cThere is no place for hate in Tower Hamlets and we will continue to come together to oppose extremism and racism in all its forms.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6489ff6451ac3318d5fe4e88", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nadine-dorries-boris-johnson-conservatives-prime-minister-nigel-adams-b2357406.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nadine Dorries could prolong Sunak\u2019s by-election challenge with \u2018unusual\u2019 delay", "lead": "The Prime Minister would welcome \u2018certainty\u2019 for her Mid Bedfordshire constituents as the Tory MP holds out on handing in her notice.", "author": "Sam Blewett", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 14:21:52 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:56:52.706061", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T14:21:52+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/13/3739cb5766fdabb2c5cb2c0c97571eedY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2ODMxNjA0-2.62440640.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He confirmed he met the man, who has not been named, when the younger man was 15 years old during a school visit, but said the affair only began when he was in his early twenties and working on This Morning.Following his admission, 61-year-old Schofield was dropped by his longtime agent YMU and resigned from ITV altogether, having previously stepped down as This Morning co-host following reports of a feud with fellow presenter Holly Willoughby.Appearing alongside her colleagues \u2013 Kevin Lygo, managing director of media and entertainment at ITV, and Kyla Mullins, general counsel and company secretary \u2013 McCall discussed when ITV bosses first became aware of rumours of an inappropriate relationship between Schofield and his colleague, referred to as \u201cPerson X\u201d.\u201cThe imbalance of power, the imbalance of dynamics in that relationship, makes it deeply inappropriate, and we have policies that say that very clearly,\u201d she said.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upShe clarified that ITV\u2019s questioning of the relationship was \u201cnot an investigation\u201d but a review, which began when intense rumours about the former presenter began in February 2020.

The value of a deferred state pension would also be counted.If you have \u00a310,000 or less in savings and investments, this will not affect your Pension Credit, but every \u00a3500 you have stored away above \u00a310,000 counts as \u00a31 income a week, according to DWP rules.You can find out more about Pension Credit eligibility here and access a useful calculator tool here.How much is Pension Credit per week?The benefit is designed to increase a single recipient\u2019s income to a minimum of \u00a3201.05 per week and a couple\u2019s to \u00a3306.85, while a person with a disability or caring responsibilities may receive even more (see below).The money is typically paid directly into your bank account.Taking receipt of even a small Pension Credit award has the added benefit of opening the door to other support measures you may be eligible for, including help with housing costs, council tax, heating bill and cost of living support payments.Does receiving Personal Independence Payment affect your Pension Credit award?Anyone with a severe disability can get an additional \u00a376.40 a week of Pension Credit if they qualify for the daily living component of PIP or, for that matter, AA, the middle or highest rate from the care component of the DLA, an Armed Forces Independence Payment or the daily living component of the ADP at the standard or enhanced rate.Similarly, those responsible for caring for another adult can receive an extra \u00a342.75 a week if they already receive CA or have claimed for it but do not receive it because they already get another benefit paying a higher amount.Those caring for a child or young person aged under 20 in secondary education or in training could get an extra \u00a361.88 per person under their charge. This is increased to \u00a372.31 a week for the first child if they were born before 6 April 2017.If that child or young person is disabled, the carer could receive a further \u00a333.67 if they already receive DLA, PIP or ADP or \u00a3104.86 a week if they are blind or have another severe disability.You can find out more about Pension Credit payments and qualification here and more about PIP here.How can I claim Pension Credit?You can apply online via the government\u2019s website and will need your National Insurance number, records of your savings and investments and your bank details to hand when you do so.If you prefer to apply by phone, you can do so between 8am and 6pm from Monday to Friday via the contact details listed below:Telephone: 0800 99 1234Textphone: 0800 169 0133Relay UK (if you cannot hear or speak on the phone): 18001 then 0800 99 1234To apply by post, print out and fill in the Pension Credit claim form or call the claim line to request that a form be sent to you.

I would say we never feel that we treat anybody, whether it\u2019s a presenter or a member of staff or a junior person that\u2019s coming in for work experience, we would really not treat anyone like a commodity.\u201dFormer Love Island host Flack was found dead in February 2020 at the age of 40, and a coroner later ruled she killed herself after learning that prosecutors were going to press ahead with an assault charge after an incident involving her boyfriend Lewis Burton.Mr Lygo told the committee: \u201cBecause of things going on in her private life, she said \u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019m fit to do the next serious of Love Island\u2019. We said \u2018OK, we understand that\u2019 but made it very clear it was her show, that we would get a stand-in, she could come back when she wanted to because she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong in our eyes.\u201cWe were offering her work and all the rest of it.

That means that those who threw a Downing Street party the night before the late Queen sat alone at her husband\u2019s funeral will now receive awards from the King.\u201cIf he is so tough, why didn\u2019t he block it?\u201d\n\nMy predecessors may not have agreed with Labour\u2019s choices of Tom Watson or Shami Chakrabarti, but the same precedent stood then as it does now.

And this will help us to make the right decisions to get the best out of generative AI in a safe and secure way.\u201dMs Keegan highlighted that there was a shortage of people coming into computing professions and she warned that the gap \u201cwill only get bigger\u201d.The Education Secretary said she hopes the Government\u2019s new Digital and Computing Skills Education Taskforce will make it \u201ceasier\u201d for students to choose computing and digital pathways at school, college and university.Speaking about T-levels qualifications which are technical alternatives to A-levels, she added: \u201cDigital skills matter.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSuella Braverman has admitted that the government does not know how much its new small boats bill will cost in a fiery Commons clash.The home secretary has vocally backed the Illegal Migration Bill, claiming it will deter Channel crossings by allowing the government to detain and deport everyone who arrives in the UK in small boats without considering asylum and modern slavery claims.But practical questions over a lack of detention capacity and deportation agreements continue to mount, and a required document assessing the cost of the law has not been published. She also admitted the bill\u2019s \u201csuccess is contingent on many unknown factors\u201d.The home secretary was grilled on the situation when she appeared before parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Committee on Wednesday, following the arrival of almost 1,200 small boat migrants in two days.In an intense clash with chair Dame Diana Johnson, Ms Braverman claimed \u201cdoing nothing is not an option\u201d but was told to \u201cjust answer the question\u201d.RecommendedSunak vow to detain all small boat migrants \u2018unworkable\u2019 as UK\u2019s immigration detention capacity revealedSuella Braverman accused of fresh ministerial code breaches over undisclosed links to RwandaSmall boats bill \u2018could lead to more dangerous routes and increase trafficking\u2019\u201cIt's 100 days since that bill was introduced in the Commons, it\u2019s gone through all Commons stages and it\u2019s now in the Lords,\u201d Dame Diana asked. \u201cWhy have we still not got any economic impact assessment?\u201cThe bill will have finished all its stages and been given royal assent by the time we get this.\u201dMs Braverman said the government would publish the document \u201cin due course\u201d, but when pressed, she admitted: \u201cThere are many unknown factors on which the bill\u2019s success is contingent, for example the delivery of our Rwanda agreement. We\u2019re currently in litigation and those timelines are out of our control.\u201dThe home secretary said flights would only take off if the government wins the ongoing legal battle, which is currently at the Court of Appeal.The Independent previously revealed that she had failed to disclose her previous work training Rwandan government lawyers to the Home Office, after working for six years as the director of a charity with close links to the Kigali government.Ms Braverman admitted that the government does not yet have a \u201cclear view of the operability\u201d of the Rwanda deal, and will not be able to confirm the economic impact of the bill until it does.Suella Braverman outlines new small boats billShe told the Home Affairs Committee that the cost of detaining all small boat migrants for 28 days, under the bill, was also \u201can unknown\u201d because of fluctuating crossing numbers.\u201cWhen the bill comes into force, we will be able to take a view on how and how quickly we will be able to operationalise our detention and relocation powers, and that will inform the costs,\u201d Ms Braverman added.The home secretary was repeatedly asked whether she would correct the record in parliament, after appearing to claim the overall backlog of asylum decisions had fallen in a period where it rocketed to a new record.Ms Braverman dismissed the questions and told the committee: \u201cAsking questions again and again is not the best use of your time, I humbly suggest to you.\u201dDame Diana replied: \u201cI would respectfully say to you, home secretary, that we decide what we wish to ask you, and how many times we need to ask to get an answer.\u201dThe home secretary was also grilled on Rishi Sunak\u2019s pledge to clear a pre-June 2022 backlog of asylum cases by the end of this year, with Conservative MP Tim Loughton suggesting it was \u201cnot realistic\u201d.He told the committee he had calculated that in order for the target to be met, asylum decisions would have to quadruple.Ms Braverman said \u201cI\u2019m not as pessimistic as you are\u201d, adding that the Home Office was recruiting more caseworkers, increasing productivity and expanding a fast-track questionnaire scheme.Last month, The Independent revealed that the UK has room for just 3,000 people to be detained under the new bill, less than a tenth of those who came across the Channel on small boats last year.Suella Braverman expanded the scope of the Rwanda deal in march  (PA)The entire capacity cannot be dedicated to small boat migrants, because places are also required for people being deported at the end of prison sentences or for immigration offences.By the end of last year, almost 1,200 people were already being held in immigration detention, and the new military bases and barges being turned into asylum accommodation cannot be used as detention facilities.It is unlawful to detain people unless they are being removed in a \u201creasonable\u201d period, meaning that the government will be forced to release small boat migrants without a concrete deportation plan.During a House of Lords debate on the Illegal Migration Bill last week, a government minister said they could only be sent to countries where Britain has struck \u201can agreement to take them back\u201d, adding: \u201cThat is not at present the case, except in relation to Rwanda, but it may in future be the case in relation to other countries.\u201dRecommendedTrafficked women could be removed under migration Bill, Braverman concedesSuella Braverman takes questions from

was unlawful and could lead to asylum seekers taking \u201cmore dangerous routes\u201d to the UK, benefit people smugglers and worsen trafficking.It said the government had not provided any evidence backing its claim that the law would deter Channel crossings, and that \u201cpeople fleeing persecution or conflict have no safe and legal way of getting here\u201d."}, {"_id":

The sap can also lead to blindness if it gets in the eyes.How is it recognised?While giant hogweed typically grows near river banks, canal towpaths, woodland and heathland, experts warn it has spread to gardens, parks and verges in recent years. Plant Tracker \u2013 an Environment Agency-based database of invasive, non-native plants \u2013 reports hundreds of sightings across all four UK nations, as far afield as Inverness, Pembrokeshire, County Londonderry and Kent.It is often mistaken for cow parsley, elderflower, bishop\u2019s lace or hemlock due to its long stems and flat-topped clusters of white leaves.While, like hemlock, its thick, bristly stems can also be pocked with purple blotches, it has fewer ferns and can grow significantly taller than either plant, with flower heads spanning up to two feet wide.How can it be disposed of?Although there is technically no statutory obligation for landowners to rid their properties of the weed, many property owners and local authorities choose to do so due to the dangers posed to the public.It is, however, an offence to allow the weed to spread into the wild \u2013 so it is possible that landowners could be deemed responsible for outbreaks believed to stem from plants growing on their property.Furthermore, landowners who fail to clear it from their land have in the past been handed anti-social behaviour orders.Giant Hogweed can cause severe burns and blisters (Creative Commons)Ideally, always wear gloves, face masks and ensure all skin is covered while dealing with giant hogweed, bearing in mind that anything coming into contact with it \u2013 be that clothing, tools or skin \u2013 will be contaminated and should be washed immediately.Young plants can be pulled up using gloved hands when soil is wet, around May when it has reached a reasonable heigh but before it has produced its flowering spike, according to the Royal Horticultural Society.For larger plants it might be necessary to loosen the roots with a fork first. Larger scale areas should probably be left to professionals to dispose of.\u201cThere is no need to be scared of the plant \u2013 just use common sense \u2013 and take action if you identify it on your property,\u201d a Mersey Rivers Trust spokesperson told The Independent, adding: \u201cKeep children away from the plant until it has died off fully.\u201cThe plant can produce up to 100,000 seeds, and the seed bank can last up to 15 years \u2013 meaning a prolonged period of vigilance for newly emerged seedlings and a prolonged period of treatment.\u201dWhat do I do if I touch giant hogweed?RecommendedBaseball-sized hail hammers Texas as state braces for severe heatwave Four dead as India and Pakistan brace for Cyclone BiparjoyFraming disasters as natural masks societal inequalities, charity saysThe NHS advises covering the area and washing it with soap and water.

This to me is deeply disturbing.\u201dPeers backed a motion to formally \u201cregret\u201d the law, which allowed it to pass but signalled the House of Lords\u2019 unhappiness, by 177 votes to 144.It was brought by Labour\u2019s Lord Coaker, who argued that blocking the law would have breached convention by stopping changes backed by elected MPs.\u201cThe police have the powers to deal with these protests,\u201d he said. \u201cAll protests could be affected across the country, with no opportunity for anyone in parliament to say that these changes go too far \u2026 this is all done without proper consultation.\u201dMoment Just Stop Oil protester thrown to ground during slow marchGovernment minister Lord Sharpe told the House of Lords the changes were necessary to \u201crespond quickly to evolving protest tactics\u201d.\u201cGiven the scale and impact of the disruption caused by slow walks and sit-ins on roads, it is in the public interest to clarify these police powers as a matter of urgency,\u201d he added.The Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023 legally redefine \u201cserious disruption\u201d, which has been the trigger for police protest powers for almost 40 years.They will lower the threshold for imposing conditions on protests in England and Wales, allowing police to take action where there could hypothetically be a \u201cmore than minor hindrance\u201d or \u201cdelay\u201d, to people\u2019s lives.The Liberty human rights group said it had written to the home secretary threatening legal action \u201cfor signing off on legislation she had no power to create\u201d.A pre-action letter said imposing restrictions on protests that cause \u201cmore than minor\u201d would be unlawful and violated constitutional principles because they had already been rejected.Katy Watts, a lawyer for Liberty, said: \u201cThe Home Secretary has sidelined parliament to sneak in new legislation via the back door, despite not having the powers to do so. \u201cThis is yet another power grab from the government, as well as the latest in a long line of attacks on our right to protest, making it harder for the public to stand up for what they believe in.\u201dRishi Sunak and his home secretary Suella Braverman have vowed to crack down on disruptive protests  (AFP/Getty)Police powers have already been expanded to allow officers to stop and search peaceful demonstrators, ban protests by a single person, arrest people for accidentally breaking conditions they \u201cought to have known\u201d about and impose \u201cserious disruption prevention orders\u201d enforceable by a year in prison.Addressing the House of Commons on Monday, Ms Braverman said police leaders had requested \u201cextra clarity\u201d on the law, following years of pressure to deal with disruptive tactics employed by environmental groups.In December, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said it had asked the government for a clearer legal definition of serious disruption in order to \u201cenable officers to take action and make arrests more effectively\u201d.But The Independent understands that senior officers did not request the wording of the law, and official consultation did not cover any significant change to the meaning of \u201cserious disruption\u201d.Opposition MPs said the new law will make policing harder by placing the burden on officers to judge what \u201cmore than minor\u201d disruption looks like, what an affected \u201ccommunity\u201d is, and to add up an entirely new concept of

of double-digit inflation, itself another pay cut \u2013 beggars belief.\u201cWe have made clear that junior doctors are looking for the full restoration of our pay, which has seen a 26% cut.\u201cJunior doctors in England have seen their pay cut in real terms by more than a quarter over the last 15 years.\u201cToday they are demonstrating what that means to the survival of the NHS.\u201dA BMA poll of 1,935 junior doctors in England, published on Wednesday, found 53% are making plans to leave the NHS or are thinking about leaving as a result of the Government\u2019s response to industrial action.Some 67% do not think the NHS in its current form will exist in 10 years and 88% expect the NHS to get worse over the next 18 months.BMA chairman of council Professor Philip Banfield has written to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak urging him to intervene to resolve the dispute.Health and Social Care Secretary Steve Barclay said it is \u201cextremely disappointing\u201d that the BMA is going ahead with further strike action.He said: \u201cThis 72-hour walkout will put patient safety and our efforts to cut waiting lists at risk.\n\n\u201cDuring recent meetings with representatives of the BMA junior doctors committee, we made a fair and reasonable opening offer and were discussing both pay and non-pay issues until they chose to end the talks by announcing new strike datesHealth Secretary Steve Barclay\u201cDuring recent meetings with representatives of the BMA junior doctors committee, we made a fair and reasonable opening offer and were discussing both pay and non-pay issues until they chose to end the talks by announcing new strike dates.\u201cIf the BMA cancels these damaging and disruptive strikes and shows willingness to move significantly from their position, we can resume confidential talks and find a way forward, as we have done with other unions.\u201dDoctors will join picket lines outside their hospitals on Wednesday and the BMA is also holding rallies throughout the rest of the week, including in Oxford, Birmingham, London and Manchester.Rory Deighton, director of the acute network at the NHS Confederation, told the PA news agency he is concerned about the impact of the strike.\u201cThe NHS has become used to managing the disruption caused by industrial action so patients should feel assured their local services are doing everything they can to prioritise those with the greatest clinical need and provide safe services for patients,\u201d he said.\u201cHowever, each wave of strikes chips away at the NHS\u2019s resilience, impacting on staff, internal relationships and their ability to deliver on government pledges to reduce the elective backlog.\u201cA particular challenge this time will be securing the level of consultant cover for absent junior doctors due to ongoing local negotiations on the overtime payments.\u201cIn reality, this means that it is still uncertain exactly how many planned procedures and appointments will need to be scaled back and rescheduled.\u201cThe national advice remains that patients should assume their care will continue unaffected unless told otherwise.\u201cWith the BMA having announced its intention to re-ballot its members for a mandate for a further six months of strikes, and with industrial action from consultants, radiographers and nurses a possibility, the short-term outlook feels gloomy.\u201cA resolution is desperately needed and we urge the Government to search for a resolution to this dispute.\u201d\n\nWhile thousands of appointments are likely to be rescheduled due to strike action, the NHS will continue to prioritise urgent and emergency care, but with the country in the midst of a heatwave, the public can play their part by being sensible in the warm weatherNHS England medical director Professor Sir Stephen PowisEarlier this week, Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, said almost all routine or pre-planned care could be impacted in some way by the latest strike.A similar walkout by junior doctors in April saw 196,000 hospital appointments and pre-planned operations rescheduled.Speaking on Wednesday, he said: \u201cThe NHS is facing significant disruption this week with a three-day strike that is set to be exacerbated by the ongoing hot weather \u2013 with the number of people seeking emergency care increasing as temperatures rise.\u201cWhile thousands of appointments are likely to be rescheduled due to strike action, the NHS will continue to prioritise urgent and emergency care, but with the country in the midst of a heatwave, the public can play their part by being sensible in the warm weather.\u201cFor the vulnerable and elderly, this includes drinking plenty of water, using sunscreen and avoiding prolonged periods in the sun or swimming in unsafe water \u2013 and please do also consider checking in on any vulnerable friends, family members or neighbours who may struggle with the heat and humidity.\u201cPeople with conditions such as asthma should continue to use their inhalers.\u201dIn Scotland, junior doctors plan to strike next month unless an improved pay offer is made, after the latest was rejected.RecommendedTiger cubs explore their enclosure at Norfolk zooNadine Dorries brands Rishi Sunak \u2018privileged posh boy\u2019 who

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA severe cyclone is inching closer to India and Pakistan as the South Asian countries evacuated tens of thousands of people, with four deaths already reported from worsening conditions.Named Biparjoy, which means \u201cdisaster\u201d in Bengali, the very severe cyclone is forecasted to make landfall between India\u2019s Kutch region in Gujarat and Pakistan\u2019s financial capital Karachi tomorrow with more evacuations ongoing.High tides, strong winds, and rainfall is already lashing several regions in western India, including Mumbai. Out of the four deaths reported, three were young boys who drowned off Mumbai\u2019s coast, while a woman was killed due to an accident caused by strong winds in Gujarat.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the cyclone was now packing maximum sustained winds of up to 145kph, gusting up to 150kph.The coastal regions in both countries are on high alert today as storm continues its northwestern journey. It was last spotted about 280 km west-southwest of Gujarat\u2019s Jakhau Port and 340km south-southwest of Karachi.Recent studies show cyclones in the Arabian Sea are getting stronger and wetter as the sea surface temperature increases by 1.2C to 1.4C in recent decades.

But in recent years, the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones has increased, latest researches show.As the global average temperatures continue to increase, the oceans are warming more than usual, creating favourable conditions for more storms.A recent study published in Elsevier's Earth Science Reviews highlights that the Arabian Sea, which historically had cooler temperatures compared to the Bay of Bengal, has undergone a drastic change in character over the past four decades.The sea surface temperatures in the Arabian Sea have increased by 1.2C to 1.4C compared to four decades ago, the study shows.Another research paper published in the journal Nature further supports these findings, demonstrating an increasing trend in the intensity, frequency, and duration of cyclonic storms and very severe CS in the Arabian Sea between 1982 and 2019.According to the study, the frequency of cyclonic storms has increased by 52 per cent in the Arabian Sea during the recent period of 2001 to 2019. Furthermore, the total duration of cyclones in the Arabian Sea has seen an 80 per cent increase over the last two decades, with the duration of very severe cyclones soaring by 260 per cent.These changes have rendered India's west coast more vulnerable to severe cyclones.Despite the north Indian Ocean accounting for only 6 per cent of global tropical cyclones annually, it has witnessed some of the most devastating cyclones, causing significant damage to countries along its rim. One of the factors of increased vulnerabilities of this region is population density and infrastructural vulnerabilities.Waves hit the stalls on the beach during high tide on the Arabian Sea coast in Mumbai, India (AP)Stuti Mishra14 June 2023 14:301686745843Weather forecast for Karachi ahead of cyclone BiparjoyPakistan's southern region of Sindh is bracing is lashed by heavy rains and thunderstorms as cyclone Biparjoy heads towards its coastal regions.In the latest advisory today, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said that Karachi is expected to receive more rain with thunderstorm and strong dust storm today.The weather in Pakistan's financial capital is expected to remain partially cloudy, hot and humid.The very severe cyclonic storm, Biparjoy, is now only 340km away from south-southwest of Karachi, 355km south-southwest of Thatta and 275km south-southwest of Keti Bandar.The impacts of the storm are also being felt in India's Gujarat and as far as Mumbai.The cyclone is expected to make landfall afternoon between Keti Bundar and India's Gujrat with a maximum sustained wind speed of 100-120km per hour (kmph), gusting to 140kmph.Pakistani flood victims cross sea water due to Cyclone Biparjoy approaching to the costal area in Karachi, Pakistan (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Stuti Mishra14 June 2023 13:301686744152Over 65,000 people evacuated in Pakistan ahead of cyclone BiparjoyPakistan's national disaster management authority have moved over 65,000 people from the coasts of the souther state of Sindh to safer locations as cyclone Biparjoy inches closer.The country's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) says the cyclone is only 300km away from the coastal area of Kati Bandar.The cyclone is expected to make a landfall in India's Kutch region of Gujarat but very close to the border with Pakistan.The country is already facing high tides, rains and heavy winds posing a threat to coastal communities. This is first big disaster to threaten Pakistan after the devastating floods of last year which killed 1,700 people.

One boy who accompanied the other three was rescued.While a woman was killed due to an accident caused by strong winds in Gujarat.Both India and Pakistan are highly vulnerable to damages in extreme weather events due to population density and infrastructural vulnerabilities.Stuti Mishra14 June 2023 12:001686739227Trains in Gujarat cancelled as cyclone Biparjoy brings extreme weatherIndia's western railway has partially cancelled some trains to Gujarat as a precautionary measure as cyclone Biparjoy brings high tide, heavy rains and gusts of winds to the province.So far 69 trains have been cancelled, 32 trains short terminated and 26 trains short originated due to the very severe cyclone.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeDescribing disasters as natural masks the systemic inequalities in access to resources and power, the head of a disaster relief charity has said.Sanj Srikanthan, CEO of ShelterBox, said framing catastrophes like earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts and floods as natural disasters undermines the need for preventative action.His comments come on the anniversary of the devastating floods in Pakistan last year, which killed over 1,700 people and 1.2 million livestock while affecting around 33 million people in total.In an open letter addressed to the UK\u2019s media, Mr Srikanthan said the term natural disaster is \u201cmisleading and harmful\u201d and it \u201cperpetuates a dangerous myth that nothing could have been done to prevent people being so badly affected\u201d.He added: \u201cWhen we frame disasters as natural, we fail to acknowledge the complex interplay between nature and the role of human actions and how they impact communities around the world.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cA disaster is not a natural occurrence but a result of systemic inequalities in access to resources and power.\u201cWhere we live and how much money we have often determines our ability to recover. By framing these events as natural, we undermine the need for proactive measures to protect vulnerable communities.\u201cIt masks the underlying social, economic, and political instability that make marginalised and disadvantaged communities disproportionately affected.\u201dPakistan\u2019s monsoon season last year saw nearly three times as much rain as the 30-year average, the British Red Cross said.It rained continuously for two months and upturned the lives of millions between June and October last year.Shortly before, in April and May, temperatures reached 49C which baked the ground so the flood water was less easily absorbed.Higher temperatures, brought on by human-induced climate change, also mean glaciers in the Himalayas and Hindu Kush melt faster and push more water through the Indus River basin, where hundreds of millions of people live and work.Mr Srikanthan said: \u201cWhen I visited Pakistan after monsoon flooding last year, it was clear how the devastating impacts of the floods were within humanity\u2019s power to mitigate \u2013 the people worse affected were those living in poverty with the least means to protect themselves and few resources to withstand the next event.\u201cIt was little reported that regions of Pakistan were in the middle of drought and food insecurity just prior to the flooding that compounded a pre-existing crisis.RecommendedNorth Atlantic temperature anomaly sparks concern among climate scientistsMinisters \u2018brave or foolish\u2019 to refuse Attenborough call for deep-sea mining banPublic asked to help water young urban trees during summer\u201cInstead of using natural disaster we simply say disaster or are more specific, describing the extreme weather, earthquake, tsunami, or volcanic eruption.\u201cI urge the media to act, help us in breaking this cycle, by reframing their reporting and committing to language that accurately reflects why people are affected so badly.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6489ff7551ac3318d5fe4ec8", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/severe-weather-cyclone-pakistan-india-b2356664.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Approaching cyclone named \u2018disaster\u2019 leads to mass evacuations in India and Pakistan", "lead": "<p>Cyclone Biparjoy - the Bangla word for \u2018disaster\u2019 - is projected to make landfall on Thursday </p>", "author": "Sibi Arasu and Munir Ahmed", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 18:53:09 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:57:09.888996", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T18:53:09+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/09/India_South_Asia_Cyclone_97733.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to the Independent Climate email for the latest advice on saving the planetGet our free Climate email\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The cyclone is likely the most powerful to hit western India and Pakistan since 2021, and follows devastating floods that ravaged Pakistan last year, leaving 1,739 people dead and $30 billion in losses.Biparjoy was packing maximum sustained winds of 111 mph, according to the India Meteorological Department. It's projected to hit land on Thursday near Jakhau port in the Kutch district of Gujarat. Pakistan\u2019s National Disaster Management Authority said the cyclone was 292 miles south of Karachi, the capital of Sindh province, on Tuesday morning.RecommendedMinisters \u2018brave or foolish\u2019 to refuse Attenborough call for deep-sea mining banLawsuit pits young climate change activists against a fossil fuel-friendly state at trialPublic asked to help water young urban trees during summerIn India, thousands were evacuated from low-lying regions, including residents living within three miles of the coast in Gujarat. Those within 6.2 miles of the coast might be moved over the next two days if required, officials said. \u201cWe have shifted 20,580 people from Gujarat\u2019s coastal districts and moved them to relief camps where they will be provided with food, drinking water and other essential material,\" said C. C. Patel, director of relief in the Gujarat state government. Authorities also banned gatherings along the beaches and shorelines during the cyclone. All ports, including two of India's largest, Mundra and Kandla, have been shut down as a precaution. In Mumbai, in the neighboring state of Maharasthra, beaches were closed during high tide. Fishermen in both countries have been asked to stay ashore and move their boats to safer locations.On Monday evening, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he chaired a meeting to review the preparedness. \"Our teams are ensuring safe evacuations from vulnerable areas and ensuring maintenance of essential services. Praying for everyone\u2019s safety and well-being,\u201d he tweeted.In Pakistan, authorities backed by the military so far had evacuated 22,000 people from coastal towns, said Sharjeel Memon, the information minister in Sindh province. The rest of the 80,000 people are expected to be moved before the landfall on Thursday. Experts say climate change is leading to an increase in cyclones in the Arabian Sea region, making preparations for natural disasters all the more urgent.\u201cThe oceans have become warmer already on account of climate change,\u201d said Raghu Murtugudde, Earth system scientist at the University of Maryland. He said a recent study shows that the Arabian Sea has warmed up by almost 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since March this year, making conditions favorable for severe cyclones.A 2021 study found that the frequency, duration and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea had increased significantly between 1982 and 2019, he said.U.N. climate reports have also stated that the intensity of tropical cyclones would increase in a warmer climate.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEngland\u2019s Harry Brook can appreciate the appeal of a lucrative life as a T20 specialist but insists nothing will ever compare to the feeling of living out his Ashes dreams.On Friday, Brook will fulfil a lifelong ambition when he takes the field against Australia in the first Test, a goal he has chased since he first started hitting balls as an infant.Brook\u2019s love of the sport comes from his upbringing in a devoted cricketing family from Burley-in-Wharfedale and, although he recently banked a cool \u00a31.3million for a two-month stint with Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League, he is clear where he feels the real riches are.\u201cThis is absolutely a childhood dream. My dad always says as soon as I could talk I said that I wanted to play for England and here we are,\u201d said the 24-year-old after a lengthy net session at Edgbaston.\u201cMy dad and my two uncles and my grandad all played at my local club. It all stemmed from there really.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI was growing up watching the very best players from England and Australia facing each other. Obviously the 2005 Ashes was a big one.\u201cI can always remember the over (Andrew) Flintoff bowled to (Ricky) Ponting and KP (Kevin Pietersen) smacking it everywhere against Warne and McGrath, those boys.\u201cYou can understand why people don\u2019t want to play Test cricket because there\u2019s so many franchise competitions out there and there\u2019s so much money you can get.\u201cIt\u2019s like being a footballer \u2013 you don\u2019t play for five days, you get three months at home \u2013 but for me Test cricket is the pinnacle. The best players play Test cricket and the best players perform in Test cricket.\u201dBrook went from emerging prospect to one of the hottest properties on the planet over the winter, named player of the series during a historic whitewash over Pakistan after reeling off a hat-trick of hundreds in Rawalpindi, Multan and Karachi.He followed with another in Mount Maunganui and, despite a disappointing IPL that saw one century among a string of low scores, the 24-year-old heads into his first meeting with Australia boasting a formidable record in the Test arena.It is hard to say which is more eye-catching, his average of 81.80 or a strike-rate of 99.03, but combined they hint at a rare talent who is riding the crest of a wave.Australia\u2019s attack, by common consensus, represents a step up in intensity. So too the wider fanfare and scrutiny that comes with the Ashes platform.\n\nThe Australians might have a little bit of extra pace, but if they bowl quicker it tends to go to the boundary quicker.But Brook retains a refreshingly unaffected view of his own role and is eager to throw himself into the challenge.\u201cThe Australians might have a little bit of extra pace, but if they bowl quicker it tends to go to the boundary quicker,\u201d he said with a grin.\u201cI\u2019m just looking to play the ball and I\u2019m not really bothered who\u2019s bowling at me. It\u2019s the same old ball coming down. Obviously, they\u2019re good but it\u2019s just another cricket ball coming at me.\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to play against the best players in the world and see how good I really am.\u201dHis success as a stand-in for Jonny Bairstow forced England into a selection dilemma when the latter returned from a broken leg.

Fairways and greens, hopefully two-putt and move on,\u201d Rahm, who won his first major at Torrey Pines in 2021, said of his gameplan.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cI think it\u2019s deceptively wide. Those fairways look bigger than they play. You still need to strike it really well tee to green to be able to give yourself some looks at birdie.\u201cIt\u2019s a design that I like. It makes you think. It\u2019s very intricate green complexes. You\u2019ve got to play the angles a little bit, and especially if you miss the greens, you\u2019re going to find yourself in some interesting spots to get up and down.\u201cIt\u2019s got everything. It\u2019s got all the ingredients to be a great week.\u201cMax Homa shot nine under on this golf course (in 2013). That\u2019s not happening right now. It\u2019s just clearly a much different golf course. The rough wasn\u2019t as high as it is right now.\u201cYou could actually afford to miss a fairway and have confidence that the ball was going to be around the green area, not always on the green.\u201cThe only thing I can say is that I have really good memories about it and I enjoyed the challenge back then. I think I\u2019m going to as well this week.\u201dRemarkably, the 284-yard seventh hole and 290-yard 11th are not even the longest par threes in US Open history, with the eighth hole at Oakmont playing to 300 yards in 2007 and 299 yards in 2016.But even Rahm, one of the longest hitters in the game, needed to hit a three wood to the seventh on Monday and described the hole as \u201csomewhat fair\u201d.\u201cI think there\u2019s a bit of a give and take,\u201d the Masters champion added. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a balance. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to play every hole tipped out [at maximum yardage] every day, either.\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of everything. If you hit perfect drives, let\u2019s say on one, two and three, you\u2019re pretty much looking at birdie options.\u201cAnd then you get kicked in the teeth with four and five and most likely seven, and possibly nine depending on pin location. There is a certain flow to the golf course in a US Open that I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201cYou have par fours where you\u2019re going to hit driver, wedge every day if you hit the fairway, no matter the wind. And then you have holes like 11, 16 and 18 that are going to play very long no matter what.\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit different, and it\u2019s fun. You\u2019ll see a lot of birdies and I think you also will see some high numbers come out of nowhere.\u201dRecommendedSteve Smith holds fond memories of Edgbaston as he prepares for Ashes battleMichael van Gerwen down in the mouth over World Cup absenceElla Toone \u2018ready and prepared\u2019 for World Cup summer with EnglandRahm was due to get his bid for a third major title under way from the 10th tee at 0824 local time (1624 BST) on Thursday alongside Ryder Cup team-mate Viktor Hovland and Olympic champion Xander Schauffele.World number one Scottie Scheffler was set to tee off 11 minutes earlier from the first tee along with Homa and Collin Morikawa, but Rory McIlroy and US PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka had to wait until 1354 local time (2154 BST) to start round one."}, {"_id": "6489ff7a51ac3318d5fe4ed5", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/eberechi-eze-england-debut-euro2020-b2356859.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Luckless Eberechi Eze in line for long-awaited England debut after setbacks of most brutal timing", "lead": "<p>Crystal Palace playmaker could make his debut two years after he was first called up by Gareth Southgate </p>", "author": "Richard Jolly", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 16:14:26 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:57:14.010309", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T16:14:26+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/05/24/14/GettyImages-1310131534.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

There was no bitterness, no sense it might have been him. \u201cI look at things deep so I saw it, \u2018listen this is just another hurdle on the way, you know what you can do and where you can get to, so the focus is to keep going and keep pushing,\u2019\u201d he explained.A theme of his career is that he does get there in the end, even if he is tripped up by the hurdles. \u201cAgainst the odds, I am in this position,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting released from Millwall was quite tough, because that was the time when everyone is getting their pro contract and you don\u2019t know where you are going.\u201d He had passed through a series of clubs. Even when picked up by QPR, he made a solitary appearance before being loaned to League Two Wycombe. \u201cWithout that experience who knows if I would be here?\u201d he wondered.Eberechi Eze has been called up by England (Nigel French/PA). (PA Wire)Now he has found the approval of two England managers: both Southgate and Roy Hodgson, who signed him for Palace in 2020 and whose unexpected return to the dugout in April brought a burst of six goals in nine games for Eze, leading to international recognition.\u201cHe has insane wisdom,\u201d said Eze. Hodgson and his long-time assistant Ray Lewington have helped Eze on and off the field, with his confidence, with his mental state, with their guidance. \u201cI owe so much to them,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has opened my eyes to more.\u201dHis chances of an England bow may be increased if the Manchester City duo of Jack Grealish and Phil Foden sit the game out after their Champions League final exertions. He hopes his parents will be able to join him in Malta. Eze is of Nigerian descent and qualified to play for two countries but when England called, it felt the right decision to accept their approach.RecommendedEberechi Eze feels injury nightmare gave him platform for England recognitionTyrone Mings on Jack Grealish\u2019s \u2018wild\u2019 celebrations and Unai Emery\u2019s simple adviceSportswashing is about to change football beyond anything you can imagineHe is a different type of talent, a player comfortable operating in small spaces, with the skill to prevail in close quarters. It is a result of his upbringing; fellow south Londoners like Wilfried Zaha and Jadon Sancho learnt the game in a similar way. \u201cI think there\u2019s load of players that have grown up playing in cages so they understand, they know what it is about,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is fun, it is enjoyable, and it is where you get your first learning as a footballer in south London. It has helped massively and I can see that now in how I play, how I think and how I assess situations. It\u2019s definitely a strength I have.\u201dThe journey from the cages of south London to Premier League pitches was indirect, his route to international football then obstructed by an ill-timed injury.

A few days before Erling Haaland, their 2022 flagship sale, played in a Champions League final, there was confirmation that Jude Bellingham, his 2023 counterpart, is going to serial Champions League winners Real Madrid.He was perhaps overshadowed by the Miami-bound Lionel Messi but it probably still represents the summer\u2019s most momentous transfer. There have been times over the last two seasons when Real have seemed to be mounting a lone campaign to prevent the Premier League from dominating Europe; they eliminated three English opponents last season and two this before the emphatic 4-0 defeat to Manchester City. It doesn\u2019t quite reverse the scoreline, but as City were also suitors for Bellingham, Real gained revenge of sorts. Perhaps they are never more potent in the transfer market than when hammered on the pitch: in 2009, after being thrashed 4-0 by Liverpool, they went out and bought Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Xabi Alonso and Kaka. Fourteen years and five Champions Leagues later, Benzema is finally leaving.Read more:How Jude Bellingham can become the anti-Haaland for Real MadridThe England midfielder adds to Real\u2019s riches in midfield and demonstrates how Premier League cannot deny the allure of Spain\u2019s mega clubsLawrence Ostlere14 June 2023 15:401686752787Hammers searching for potential Declan Rice replacementWest Ham is on the search for a potential Declan Rice replacements as the club braces for his departure.

Smith settled in at two, behind Marnus Labuschagne and narrowly ahead of the in-form Travis Head.\u201cI think it\u2019s cool to see us all at the top of the tree,\u201d Smith said.RecommendedMichael van Gerwen down in the mouth over World Cup absenceStuart Broad preferred to Mark Wood for England\u2019s opening Ashes TestElla Toone \u2018ready and prepared\u2019 for World Cup summer with England\u201cI think those two in particular, the improvements they\u2019ve made over the last four or five years have been exceptional.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSteve Harmison stood at the top of his mark, all alone. It is a naked place, preparing to bowl the first ball of a most-likely doomed Ashes series in a bearpit like the Gabba, surrounded by a wall of 40,000 rabid Brisbanites who do not wish you well and are vocally letting you know about it. As he ran towards the crease the noise grew louder. Harmison has tried many times to explain what happened next, why the ball flew diagonally out of his grasp, skidded off the wicket and ended up in the lap of captain Andrew Flintoff at second slip. \u201cI froze,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cMy whole body was nervous. I could not get my hands to stop sweating. The first ball slipped out of my hands, the second did as well and, after that, I had no rhythm, nothing.\u201dHaving stewed on it for more than a decade, he said in 2017: \u201cI was trying far too hard to bowl too fast. Did I freeze? Possibly. I just think I tried too hard.\u201dSteve Harmison and Justin Langer watch his delivery fly towards Freddie Flintoff (Getty Images)It is something unique in Test cricket \u2013 the wait. The batsman shuffles on his crease, the wicketkeeper claps his gloves, the umpire straightens his hat. The morning sun has just emerged over the stadium walls and it feels like the start of something, something that may be magical or dramatic or destructive \u2013 no one yet knows what, but it will definitely be something. After all the build-up and preparation and mind-games, the world slows down in those last few seconds before a Test series finally begins. And perhaps the ability of a lead bowler or batsman to handle that moment, that scrutiny, can ripple across the grass and take hold of a team.Harmison\u2019s famous wide has long been credited with \u201csetting the tone\u201d for what was to come: England meekly surrendering the Ashes in a 5-0 whitewash. But does the first ball of the series really indicate \u2013 even influence \u2013 what follows?RecommendedA look at Edgbaston\u2019s Ashes history as England and Australia prepare for openerMost opening balls down the years have been uneventful, offering little in the way of a forecast, but there have been some significant moments. In 1994, Michael Slater bludgeoned England\u2019s stand-in fast bowler Phil DeFreitas\u2019s first delivery to the Gabba boundary, then proceeded to rack up a merciless 176. Needless to say, Australia won the series.\u201cI suppose DeFreitas being cut for four first ball did set the tone,\u201d Phil Tufnell later reflected. \u201cAt the time it really didn\u2019t feel like the end of the world. We just thought: \u2018Oh right, that\u2019s gone for four, next ball.\u2019 There wasn\u2019t a groan around the fielders or anything. It\u2019s only looking back you can see that it was one of those moments.\u201dIn the previous Ashes before his infamous wide, Harmison had opened the 2005 series with a fierce over of pace and bounce at Lord\u2019s. The first ball whistled between Justin Langer\u2019s off-stump and his nose, and the second crashed into the batsman\u2019s arm. Yet England lost that Test convincingly, and it was only later that they rallied to eventual victory.Then there was 2010, when Australian bowler Ben Hilfenhaus served up a loose opener in Brisbane which Andrew Strauss comfortably let by. Strauss\u2019s control of the situation was mirrored by England\u2019s performance as they clinched a 3-1 victory and won their first Ashes on Australian soil for 24 years. Yet that first delivery was no omen: Strauss was out two balls later, caught behind for a duck.Andrew Strauss, right, loses his wicket to Ben Hilfenhaus (Getty Images)Langer certainly believed Harmison\u2019s wide ball in 2006 was more significant than the value of one Australian run, after which \u201cEngland\u2019s body language seemed flat and even a little intimidated\u201d.\u201cTo be perfectly truthful, I felt let down after that first ball,\u201d Langer said. \u201cIt was such a comedown after Lord\u2019s in 2005, where I remember the ball flying past my nose to Geraint Jones. I looked around and England were looking at their toes. It was just a huge letdown and that first ball was really key.\u201dHarmison rejects that idea. \u201cThat ball in Brisbane on the 2006-07 Ashes tour didn\u2019t set the tone,\u201d he wrote in his book, Speed Demons. \u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough to beat Australia, whether that first ball of the series happened or not.\u201dPerhaps \u2018setting the tone\u2019 is just an easy answer with hindsight. What the first ball really can do is solidify a feeling in the air. Australia were overwhelming favourites when England turned up in Brisbane again in 2021, and that sense of inevitability was quickly reinforced. Mitchell Starc started the series with an 88mph swinger which wrapped around Rory Burns\u2019 legs and clattered the stumps. The Gabbatoir had another first-ball victim. Burns\u2019 Test career never recovered, and neither did England, losing the match by nine wickets and the series 4-0. Burns was memorably bowled by Starc with the first ball of the 2021 series (Jason O\u2019Brien/PA) (PA Wire)RecommendedA look at Edgbaston\u2019s Ashes history as England and Australia prepare for openerWhat is DRS and how does it work?Moeen Ali reveals what convinced him to come out of retirement for AshesThat was the last \u2018first ball\u2019. England have sparked an unimaginable shift in the Test cricket landscape since then. The next one could be James Anderson to David Warner, or perhaps Starc to Zak Crawley. For all England\u2019s talk of fearless cricket, Crawley pumping the first ball to the Edgbaston boundary would be an apt way to spell out what\u2019s to come this summer.England would do well to be wary, though \u2013 they have generally been on the wrong end of most dramatic Ashes starts, and head coach Brendon McCullum knows the consequences of going hard early. He tried to knock out the floodlights at the start of the 2015 World Cup final, only to swing and miss, handing over New Zealand\u2019s most prized wicket.

I hope that\u2019s enough to inspire a few too.\u201dBrook, who averages a remarkable 81.80, is far from daunted by the idea of taking on the ICC\u2019s newly-crowned world champions and their much-vaunted bowling attack.

Obviously, they\u2019re good but it\u2019s just another cricket ball coming at me. But I\u2019ve always wanted to play against the best players in the world and see how good I really am.\u201cThey\u2019re one of the best teams in the world, coming off the back of a World Test Championship win. I\u2019m looking forward to facing those boys, challenging myself against them and whatever plans they have against me.\u201dBrook\u2019s success at the top level is not based solely on weight of runs, but speed of scoring. He boasts a Test strike rate of 99.03 \u2013 a fraction shy of run-a-ball \u2013 and did some of his best work against spin during the winter tour of Pakistan.Australia have often prioritised attacking English spinners over the years and are likely to do so again with Moeen Ali, with Brook promising Nathan Lyon more of the same.\n\nObviously, they\u2019re good but it\u2019s just another cricket ball coming at meHarry BrookAsked how he intended to approach a player with 487 wickets to his name, Brook\u2019s response was typically unvarnished.\u201cWhat do you think?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeEuro 2024 qualifiers are well underway and Gareth Southgate has his squad together again for another two this month - and 14 June marked exactly one year before the tournament itself starts.While qualifiers will play a big role in deciding who goes in the Three Lions\u2019 squad - assuming no incredible fall-off and they somehow fail to reach the extended tournament - performances during the new 2023/24 campaign should be the biggest indicator of who goes.With that said, it\u2019s worth looking at who might be in pole position for a place in the final 26 right now and where the movement in a potential England squad could come from, both from those currently out of favour and those who might come from nowhere to seize a role next year. Here are our current selections, ordered by position and then ranking within each group.On the plane...GoalkeepersRecommendedJodi Jones relishing chance to take on England after overcoming injury despairRashford underlines commitment to England after missing recent gamesEze in line for long-awaited England debut after setbacks of most brutal timingJordan Pickford - The undisputed No.1 for Southgate, but with two challengers in the Champions League next term, he\u2019ll need a big season of his ownNick Pope - Was one of the league\u2019s top couple of goalkeepers last year; same again and he\u2019ll be confident of a charge at a major role at a major tournamentAaron Ramsdale - Playing for one of the top teams will help his cause but needs more consistency to seriously trouble for the jersey. An easy pick among the three, thoughDefendersJohn Stones - From being a candidate to leave out a few years ago to suddenly being England\u2019s only in-form and must-have centre-back...and he doesn\u2019t even play centre-back for his club anymore (The FA via Getty Images)Luke Shaw - If he\u2019s fit, he\u2019s in. Shaw has been excellent at times for club and country and there are not too many other left-backs who can match thatKieran Trippier - The right-back debate will no doubt rumble on throughout the course of Euro 2024 qualifying but Trippier looks a lock right nowKyle Walker - As above, the Man City man has proven his worth for England in a variety of tactical setups and is unlikely to be overlookedMidfieldersDeclan Rice - The definite lock-in to start in midfield, with the minor caveat that a summer transfer obviously has to see him settle wellJude Bellingham - As above, but a bigger talent. He\u2019s also joined a bigger club though. Star at Real Madrid and he\u2019ll be one of the first on the teamsheet for England (The FA via Getty Images)Mason Mount - Hasn\u2019t had a good year but nor has anybody at Chelsea really. Too good, versatile, consistent and hard-working to not be in Southgate\u2019s plansForwardsHarry Kane - Captain and record goalscorer, he\u2019s obviously startingMarcus Rashford - Won his place back for the national team at the World Cup but must continue to push on and maintain that level for next season tooBukayo Saka - Has nudged ahead as the right-wing starter and rightly so. Immense talent who has it all (The FA via Getty Images)Jack Grealish - Playing regularly for Man City and winning everything so he\u2019ll be in, though probably with a sub role stillPhil Foden - Might be top of the \u201cbest of the rest\u201d pile at present but there\u2019s still the sense there\u2019s another level to come from Foden. Perhaps next season we\u2019ll see it more consistentlyRaheem Sterling - Perhaps in need of a reset and might get it under Mauricio Pochettino. Was a guaranteed starter not long ago so will still be involvedAlmost there...The players in favour and in the mix right now, but who must maintain fitness, form and consistency to make the eventual cut:Marc Guehi - To be blunt, nobody is absolutely assured of being an England centre-back beyond Stones. Guehi might not be likely to start but a place in the squad could certainly be his if he just...plays, and does it reasonably well for Crystal PalaceHarry Maguire - At the other end of the certainty scale, Maguire would be in and starting if he had a club role, but he doesn\u2019t. A transfer this summer has to go wellReece James - Perhaps just about third in the right-back battle at present is the Chelsea man, but he\u2019s had real fitness issues over the last year and missed the World Cup tooTrent Alexander-Arnold - The Liverpool man has been in wonderful form for a few months but has a Stones-type role for his club. For England, he still appears to have...not much of anything (The FA via Getty Images)Ben Chilwell - Will make the squad if he\u2019s fit as second left-back, but hasn\u2019t had an international impact for some time nowJordan Henderson - One of the long-term squad members who might now be forced to look over his shoulder after a desperately poor season. Will be 34 by the time England play either their first or second game at the finalsConor Gallagher - As hit-or-miss as they come right now given his club squad role, uncertainty over even that and his own lack of regular place in the Three Lions\u2019 squadCallum Wilson - Probably just about ahead in the race for the backup to Kane at centre-forward right now, but this specific backup role has been in a constant state of flux for about five yearsIn consideration...Those who have been in recent squads, but either not fully seized their chance yet or need an upturn in consistency, top form or managerial favour to earn a spot in the 26 over another challenger:Sam Johnstone; Lewis Dunk, Tyrone Mings, Ben White; Eberechi Eze, Kalvin Phillips; James Maddison, Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen (The FA via Getty Images)Work to do...Whether through injury, loss of form or suspension, or simply Southgate preferring others right now, a handful of players have been in and around the squad over the past few years but look somewhat down the order of preference at present:Dean Henderson; Eric Dier, Conor Coady, Fikayo Tomori, Joe Gomez; James Ward-Prowse; Ivan Toney, Tammy Abraham, Jadon Sancho, Dominic Calvert-LewinWildcards...And finally, a few players who are either uncapped or have been in the international wilderness for a long spell - but showed good form in 2022/23 and could mount a real charge for a place if they begin 23/24 brightly...Solly March - A potential left-back alternative? The Brighton man delivered work rate and final-third contribution from a range of roles under Roberto De ZerbiJoe Willock - Competition for places will be important but so too could be big displays in the Champions LeagueSean Longstaff - The same as above, but slightly more combative and defensive-mindedJacob Ramsey - A potential door-unlocker who can play centrally or from the channels and has captained the U21s (Getty Images)Harvey Barnes - Get a transfer, fit right in, score goals in Europe, get a shot at a shirt. Job doneDwight McNeil - Might need a few wide attackers to fall off the grid before he\u2019s considered but don\u2019t rule the Everton man out entirelyRecommendedEberechi Eze feels injury nightmare gave him platform for England recognitionJude Bellingham uses pain of England\u2019s near misses in bid for Euro 2024 gloryPretty Woman makes Pep Guardiola\u2019s day as Julia Roberts hails Man City championsEmile Smith Rowe - Remember him?!

The women\u2019s game is growing massively, as a club we are in the Champions League now as well so that\u2019s extra games.

We know how much talent we have in England now. We\u2019re obviously missing a few big names and people who were massive in the Euros win, but we\u2019ve got to look forward and be confident in the team that\u2019s going.\u201dFun Football is an initiative to give children aged five to 11 free access to the game, and Toone said: \u201cIt\u2019s great for the next generation of young girls.RecommendedCiaran Clark and Matty Longstaff leaving NewcastleJohn Hollins: A Stamford Bridge fixture who turned reading game into an art formHarry Brook is hoping to realise his Ashes dream against Australia\u201cIt\u2019s something we probably missed out on and wish we\u2019d had when we were growing up.

They start at 9.54pm on Thursday.Tommy Fleetwood showed his good touch in a narrow play-off defeat at the Canadian Open, and also has two major winners for company in the form of Shane Lowry and Justin Thomas. The trio are among the early starters on the opening day with a tee time of 3.40pm.Jon Rahm begins at 4.24pm with Viktor Hovland and Xander Schauffele, with all three likely to fancy their chances of a tilt at the title. That might also be true of the all-American group off at 4.13pm - it is headlined by Scottie Scheffler, the top-ranked player in the world, but Collin Morikawa shapes as a contender with his smooth

Netflix is back with another behind-the-scenes sport docuseries, following in the footsteps of Break Point, Full Swing and Drive to Survive. The producer James Gay-Rees was behind the brilliant movie documentaries Amy, Maradona and Oasis: Supersonic before focusing on sports series with colleague Paul Martin, and they have struck gold with a format that manages to reel in both the discerning sports fan and the curious passer-by.So perhaps it is no surprise that watching Tour de France: Unchained feels an awful lot like an episode of, say, Drive to Survive. Then again, while it may all feel a little familiar, each sport delivers something a little different. Delving deep into tennis reveals the mental and physical grind of the tour; beneath golf\u2019s surface is the psychological torment of a maddening game; Formula One is laced with danger in a cut-throat industry. What makes the Tour de France unique is the constant pain and suffering the riders endure, and the \u201cwar games\u201d between rival teams that unfolds in real time on the road.Unchained tells the story of the 2022 Tour, capturing the 21 stages across 10 episodes. At the heart of the series is an epic duel between the double reigning champion, Tadej Pogacar, and the Danish pretender, Jonas Vingegaard. Vingegaard explains how he was working in a fish factory a few years ago until Jumbo-Visma took a chance on his potential. Bizarrely for a man from such a flat country, the highest mountains have become his strength, but he admits he will need his teammates to succeed. \u201cTo beat Pogacar, you cannot do it alone.\u201dRecommendedMark Cavendish lands emotional victory in final stage of farewell Giro d\u2019ItaliaGeraint Thomas has no plans to follow Mark Cavendish into retirementGeraint Thomas heartbreakingly loses Giro d\u2019Italia on penultimate stagePogacar is two years younger than Vingegaard but he is presented as the all-powerful superstar of cycling, which seems about right. Not only can he stand more suffering than most, he actively enjoys it. \u201cPogacar is a masochist,\u201d commentator David Millar explains to camera. \u201cBut he\u2019s a sadist too.\u201dThe series captures the growing stress of the leading protagonists and their teams, and brings out the tension within Vingegaard\u2019s Jumbo-Visma as his multi-talented teammate Wout van Aert tries to find a balance between personal glory and team targets. Interviews reveal just how annoyed Vingegaard was by one of Van Aert\u2019s solo surges to victory.Stage 21 of the Tour de France 2022 (A.S.O./Charly Lopez)Ineos Grenadiers get plenty of attention, with a visit to the home of Geraint Thomas and a focus on Britain\u2019s rising star, Tom Pidcock.And it is not just the strongest teams which hog the limelight. An early episode captures AG2R\u2019s Ben O\u2019Connor, the Australian who finished fourth the previous year, carrying the hopes of the French underdogs. When a scan reveals he has torn his hamstring, O\u2019Connor thinks his race is over, but his unhinged team principal insists it is merely a scratch and demands he gets back on his bike next day. Incredibly, O\u2019Connor completes another stage of the Tour with a shredded leg muscle before hobbling out of the race.One of the more poignant episodes follows Thibaut Pinot, the lovable Frenchman who has always carried home expectations wherever he goes. The cameras show him in his happy place, on his farm in Melisey \u2013 \u201cdonkeys bring me a pleasure I don\u2019t get from most humans,\u201d he says \u2013 and capture his frustration as he tries to rekindle his form of yesteryear. \u201cI don\u2019t like letting people down,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes I wish I was less popular and more successful.\u201dRecommendedTom Pidcock plays down yellow jersey ambitions at Tour de FranceMark Cavendish lands emotional victory in final stage of farewell Giro d\u2019ItaliaGeraint Thomas heartbreakingly loses Giro d\u2019Italia on penultimate stageThe Tour reaches the Paris Champs Elysees to close out the 2022 race (A.S.O./Aurelien Vialatte)Ultimately the show delivers exactly what it promises: enough drama, tension and human interest to entertain the non-cycling fan, with plenty of original insight for those who watched every pedal stroke of the 2022 Tour and know exactly what\u2019s coming around the next corner. Yes, the format is well-worn by now.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCricket has long embraced the use of technology to aid officiating, with the Decision Review System (DRS) a by-now familiar feature of international and some domestic The system was introduced in a bid to help the on-field umpires make fewer obvious errors, granting power to batters and bowlers to challenge decisions that they feel have been made incorrectly. In time, the use of the third umpire has become more and more prevalent, with even marginal calls now often reviewed, but the system can prove pivotal if employed shrewdly. Indeed, two of the most thrilling Ashes series in recent memory might have ended differently had the system been available or better utilised: in 2005, before DRS was in place, Australia may well have squeaked home at Edgbaston and gone on to win the series had Michael Kasprowicz been able to review a caught-behind decision; in 2019, Australia\u2019s misuse of the system at Headingley proved costly as they found themselves out of reviews after Ben Stokes survived a late LBW appeal on his way to an extraordinary match-winning innings.Here\u2019s what you need to know about the system:RecommendedMoeen Ali could not turn down Ashes series under Ben Stokes\u2019 captaincyWomen\u2019s Ashes points system explainedWhat is Bazball? How England revolutionised Test cricketWhat is DRS and what does it stand for?DRS stands for Decision Review System, and was first brought in to Test cricket in 2008. It enables players to challenge decisions made by the on-field umpires - a bowling side can challenge a \u201cnot out\u201d decision, while a batter can ask to review after being given out.How does it work?After a decision is made by the on-field umpires, or the ball otherwise becomes dead, the players have up to 15 seconds to decide if they wish to review it. An intention to review is signalled by either the batter on strike or the fielding captain making a \u2018T\u2019 sign, at which point the umpires refer their decision to the third umpire, who has the benefit of replays.The third umpire then takes as long as required to either stay with or overturn the on-field decision, using a range of technologies at his disposal and all available television camera angles to make their final ruling, before returning to the on-field standing umpire to make a signal.Each team has three unsuccessful reviews per Test innings - this was upped from two during Covid to compensate for the pandemic-enforced use of non-neutral umpires, and has remained since.What technology can the third umpire use?Beyond pure footage, there are three technologies utilised during the DRS process. Ultra-Edge or Real Time Snicko (RTS)Ultra-Edge, also known as Real Time Snicko (RTS), uses a sensitive microphone placed near the stumps to generate a waveform displaying the soundwave of a connected oscilloscope. This waveform is then automatically synchronised with television footage to show sounds as they happened, with clear spikes on the waveform showing contact with the bat or pad. The one drawback of the technology is that it cannot distinguish what was struck, relying on the third umpire to interpret whether the ball has hit bat or pad when the two are close together - though this is reasonably rare.Hot SpotHot Sport is an infrared imaging system also used to determine if the ball has made contact with the bat. It requires two infrared cameras on either side of the ground that continuously record footage, which is then made available to the third umpire. Contact with the bat, or the batter\u2019s body, is typically evidenced by a bright, white spot where friction has elevated the temperature of the contacted area. While once preferred to RTS, improvements in the accuracy of the Ultra-Edge technology means that it is now generally used as the primary form of determining if a batter has edged the ball.Ball trackingGenerally using the computer vision system Hawk-Eye, also employed in tennis, ball tracking is used to assess leg before wicket (LBW) decisions. After a batter is struck on the pad or body, the ball tracking technology plots the trajectory the delivery would have continued on if not interrupted, predicting whether or not it would have hit the stumps. The technology can also assess whether the ball pitched or struck the batter in line with the stumps.What is umpire\u2019s call?Umpire\u2019s call will be commonly sighted when the third umpire asks for ball tracking. Put simply, it means that the benefit of the doubt is given to the on-field umpire\u2019s decision when no clear error has been made. RecommendedA look at Edgbaston\u2019s Ashes history as England and Australia prepare for openerMoeen Ali reveals what convinced him to come out of retirement for AshesEngland vs Australia live stream: How to watch the Ashes online and on TVWhile the ball tracking technology is good, there is a small margin for error. For this reason, both the point at which the batter was struck and whether the ball would go on to hit the stumps can be assessed as umpire\u2019s call, sticking with the on-field decision. If the centre of the ball was outside what is called the \u201cImpact Zone\u201d as it struck the batter, an umpire\u2019s call is returned; similarly, if less than half of the ball is projected to go on to hit the stumps, the on-field call will also be upheld.If an LBW decision is upheld on umpire\u2019s call, the team that took the review does not lose it.

Few putts here or there that lipped out that should have gone in.

I\u2019ve never really been one to try and overthink things, so I try and keep things as simple as possible.\u201cI looked at that one that\u2019s a little bit bigger, and I still am kind of undecided on what I think of it.\u201cPutting is such a weird thing. Sometimes when you\u2019re on the green when you feel good you feel like you\u2019re never going to miss, and then sometimes when you feel terrible you feel like you\u2019re never going to make.\u201cPutting is just so different than the rest of the game, so when it comes to putters, it\u2019s all personal.\u201dDespite Scheffler\u2019s struggles on the greens, his stellar long game means he has been installed as 7/1 favourite for the US Open ahead of the man who succeeded him as Masters champion, Jon Rahm, and US PGA Championship winner Brooks Koepka.The 26-year-old also has the advantage of being one of a handful of players to have competed on the North Course in tournament conditions, winning one point from two matches as the United States thrashed Great Britain and Ireland 19-7 in the 2017 Walker Cup.\u201cI don\u2019t recall playing my best here during the Walker Cup, but I remembered it being pretty difficult,\u201d Scheffler added.RecommendedMax Homa hoping for \u2018carnage\u2019 and a \u2018typical\u2019 US Open challengeJodi Jones relishing chance to take on England after overcoming injury despairThe drive to make disabled sport more affordable must continue \u2013 Rainbow Mbuangi\u201cIf my memory serves me well, it\u2019s a pretty hard course.

Obviously, I didn\u2019t know if they were genuine but then they started contacting my family regularly,\u201d he tells the PA news agency.\u201cIt was the president (Bjorn Vassallo) who reached out to me on there, then he got my number and was calling me a lot.\n\nIt's got my love for the game back. It's been a great experience, playing international football, even just little things on a shirt like a badge that says Euro qualifiersJodi Jones\u201cI played against Luke (Gambin, Sutton\u2019s Malta international) and he messaged me on Instagram saying they were asking about me out there.\u201cThen they reached out to me not too long after that with a proper phone call and contacted the club, that\u2019s when I thought, \u2018oh, yeah, obviously this is genuine\u2019.\u201cI was injured at the time so I wasn\u2019t really interested, not because I didn\u2019t want to do it, I was interested but I just wanted to focus on getting back fit. As soon as I was and I thought I was back to my best I thought, \u2018now\u2019s the perfect time\u2019.\u201dA seventh appearance came in Friday\u2019s 1-0 win in Luxembourg, a victory which may not resonate worldwide but against a team 80 places above them in the FIFA rankings it suggests quick progress in Michele Marcolini\u2019s three games in charge.\u201cIt\u2019s got my love for the game back. It\u2019s been a great experience, playing international football, even just little things on a shirt like a badge that says Euro qualifiers,\u201d says Jones.\u201cAs a kid when you get a football kit you want it to have everything on. I remember Arsenal kits when I was younger, I wanted the Champions League badge on it, I wanted the Premier League badge. I\u2019m still like a kid when I see things like that.\u201cIt\u2019s got my name back out there as well, which I really needed because if you mentioned my name, people say, \u2018well, he\u2019s done his ACL three times\u2019.\u201cNow, if you say my name they\u2019ll say, \u2018he did his ACL three times, but he\u2019s still playing, he\u2019s just been promoted with Notts County, he\u2019s an international and is playing against England\u2019. So the positives have overtaken now.\u201cI just enjoy the little things, like just being able to play. I know how quickly things can change, especially with what I\u2019ve been through.\u201dThe support of his family \u2013 and godparents Terry and Geraldine \u2013 has been crucial in helping Jones return from despair but it took dad Jay to remind him of how far he has come.\u201cMy godparents, they\u2019ve sacrificed a lot for me. From the age of six they\u2019ve taken me to football because my parents were very young when they had me,\u201d said the 25-year-old, who made just two appearances for Coventry between November 2018 and August 2021 because of injury.\u201cWithout them I definitely wouldn\u2019t be a footballer. I can\u2019t thank them enough. For my parents and my partner I\u2019d say it\u2019s more they\u2019re just relieved to see me back playing.\u201cMy dad said to me the other day, \u2018for all you\u2019ve been through you\u2019ve still played at Wembley twice, you\u2019re going to be playing against England, you\u2019ve been promoted two or three times\u2019.\u201cHe said for someone to have missed so much you\u2019ve also achieved so much.\u201cBeing from England and watching England when I was a kid, playing against them would mean just a little bit more. It\u2019ll just be a massive thing.\u201cI\u2019m just really excited my family can come and watch me play. I want to be able to be a role model to them, just show them to follow your dreams and they can come true.\u201dJones has Maltese connections on both sides of his family but more on his father\u2019s side with Jay and mum, Frances, flying out. His partner Zoe, children and godparents will be at the Ta\u2019 Qali Stadium for the Group C game.He also remains close with James Maddison, remaining in a WhatsApp group with former Coventry team-mates with the ribbing about trying to keep up with the Leicester star ongoing.Friday will cap his comeback season after Notts County\u2019s dramatic National League play-off promotion.Last month, Jones\u2019 first goal since October 2018 sent the Magpies to Wembley after his last-minute extra-time winner capped a thrilling 3-2 semi-final victory over Boreham Wood before a penalty shoot-out win over Chesterfield in the final.Jones, who made his senior debut at 16 for Dagenham in 2014, scored in the shoot-out and knows how special one more goal on Friday would be.RecommendedMax Homa hoping for \u2018carnage\u2019 and a \u2018typical\u2019 US Open challengeScottie Scheffler considers putter change to solve problems ahead of US OpenThe drive to make disabled sport more affordable must continue \u2013 Rainbow Mbuangi\u201cI\u2019ve pictured it loads of times, whether it\u2019ll happen is another thing,\u201d says Jones, who joined the Magpies permanently this month after leaving Oxford.\u201cI believe in my ability and I know if I get one chance I will take it.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6489ff8351ac3318d5fe4ef9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/california-los-angeles-phil-casey-b2357245.html", "primaryCategory": "Golf", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Max Homa hoping for \u2018carnage\u2019 and a \u2018typical\u2019 US Open challenge", "lead": "The American shot a nine-under-par 61 at Los Angeles Country Club on his way to winning the Pac-12 title in 2013.", "author": "Phil Casey", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 09:00:24 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:57:23.574391", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T09:00:24+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/10/13-e2a2383a24884243b07e38c150a03dd0.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I think it will be really fair.\u201cOne of the more severe US Opens I\u2019ve been to was Winged Foot (in 2020), but it\u2019s so penal off the tee that once you mess that up, everyone is doing the same thing.\u201cThis course will be a lot different. I think it\u2019ll be a great test of all areas of your golf, and it will really show a quality shot will go to a good spot, and one that\u2019s not great is going to go to a bad spot and you\u2019re going to see a lot of silliness go on.\u201cThis venue is awesome for a US Open.\u201dHoma has yet to record a top-10 finish in 15 major appearances, with a best result of 13th in the 2022 US PGA, but the California native has won four of his six PGA Tour titles in his home state.And with his course knowledge also potentially a significant advantage, the 32-year-old American finds himself among the favourites for the year\u2019s third major championship.\u201cI really do believe that my golf game is plenty good enough to contend in these things,\u201d the world number seven said.\n\nI just think I get here and I try too hardMax Homa on his poor record in majors\u201cI think I\u2019ve shown that in other PGA Tour events.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe drive to bridge financial barriers faced by many disabled people to gain equal access to sport must continue at full speed, according to England Blind Football international Rainbow Mbuangi.The latest Annual Disability and Activity Survey published by national charity Activity Alliance showed nearly 40 per cent of disabled people felt the cost-of-living crisis had impacted how active they are.Around 2,000 disabled and non-disabled adults aged over 16 took part in the survey, which found disabled people were more likely to say they wanted to be more active \u2013 with 64 per cent feeling the Government should focus on making activities affordable.Mbuangi was part of the England squad which finished third at the 2022 IBSA Blind Football European Championships.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe 20-year-old is aiming to be selected for the International Blind Sports Federation World Games, which will be held in Birmingham during August and could lead to qualification for the 2024 Paralympics in Paris.After becoming blind from the age of eight when he developed a detached retina in his left eye and then gradually lost the sight in the other, Mbuangi has had to tackle many barriers, both physical and financial, to achieve his goals.Mbuangi \u2013 who is set to play for the Royal National College for the Blind team in the FA Disability Cup Blind final against Brighton at St George\u2019s Park on June 24 \u2013 hopes future generations will not face the same issues he did trying to keep active.\u201cI think 100 per cent they (survey results) are to be expected, only because of the kind of perception of disability sports that people have,\u201d Mbuangi told the PA news agency.\u201cIn the last couple of years, it has got a lot better, but we just need to keep on building from that, trying to make those stats go down and it is key to get that awareness out and show how we can improve things.\u201cThere is so much within disability sports where you have to kind of provide for yourself, then on top of that you have got things like not being able to get there, so it is really hard.\u201cIf you wanted to go and buy a football to train on your own, you can get one for around \u00a310, but for someone who is blind who needs a decent football, you are talking about \u00a340 or \u00a350, so it is definitely a big aspect financially.\u201cThen you have travel, we can\u2019t drive, so you have got things around that. With me being blind, I can\u2019t just go out on an everyday run on my own or go on a 50-mile bike ride, so there is the physical aspect as well.\u201dMbuangi feels having the full backing of organisations like the Football Association can only have a positive impact on disability sport.\u201cMore budget is getting put into it now, with more technology, more help and support,\u201d said Mbuangi, who is studying Physical Education at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston.\u201cEngland\u2019s cerebral palsy squad has just came back from the Euros and they finished second.\u201cIt is just so important to see, but we are pushing on because we are getting that support.\u201cAt the beginning of the year, the FA had a camp in Tenerife where players from all the Para-sports went out there.RecommendedAndy Morrison expects Manchester City to build on Champions League gloryA look at Edgbaston\u2019s Ashes history as England and Australia prepare for openerFootball rumours: Man United, Real Madrid and Chelsea fight for Kylian Mbappe\u201cThat is really key as well because we all got to know each other and kind of understand each other\u2019s abilities and how we play.\u201cBut also it is that they (FA) kind of want to focus on us, give us that support and what we need to help us to reach the heights of gold medals.\u201d"}, {"_id": "6489ff8551ac3318d5fe4f01", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/andy-murray-nottingham-open-attacks-b2357183.html", "primaryCategory": "Tennis", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Andy Murray shaken by \u2018heartbreaking\u2019 Nottingham attacks", "lead": "<p>Murray had dinner in Nottingham city centre while competing at the Rothesay Open, and was shocked after news that three people were killed and another three were hospitalised in an attack </p>", "author": "Jonathan Veal", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 08:18:33 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:57:25.489981", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T08:18:33+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/14/08/TENNIS%20Nottingham%20%2018200436.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to our free sport newsletter for all the latest news on everything from cycling to boxingSign up to our free sport email for all the latest news\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAfter Pep Guardiola put down the European Cup, he immediately implored his players to embrace that feeling. The Catalan may have joked in his press conference about catching up with Real Madrid but he was deeply serious in private about now going on to retain the Champions League and win many more.It wasn\u2019t just the joy of victory that ran through the club in the early hours of Sunday morning, after all. It was the sense a psychological barrier had been broken. That has also meant we are in new territory for the game, as it faces a period of huge upheaval.A first Champions League for a state-owned club is a historic landmark, most of all for a future that has long been coming. Such success is a statistical inevitability when you can invest as much as possible without any risk.Many would point to how all of this is actually part of an economic plan for states like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and that is true, even if sport is one part of this where it\u2019s more about normalisation and image than actual economic return. The differences in figures are too great. The \u201csportswashing\u201d aims are more sophisticated. They still form a core of projects outlined by documents such as The Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030.The parallel selection of that year, and how all of this has influenced the game, now provokes a more searching question.RecommendedPep Guardiola sets sights on becoming the greatest \u2013 and Abu Dhabi\u2019s masterplan can make it a realityThe lesson Qatar has learnt as Manchester United takeover bid enters final stagesFirst golf, now football? Saudi Arabia\u2019s grand plan and the 72 hours that changed everythingWhat will football actually look like by 2030?That year is all the more important since it is when the centenary World Cup will take place, a competition that has immense symbolic value.The hosts will be decided in the third quarter of 2024 and that process is still seen by football industry figures as one of the most influential factors in the game. The outcome essentially dictates the next decade of football, if not longer. That is primarily because they shape the next biggest factors, which are broadcasting deals and the purchase of clubs. This can be tracked over the last 30 years.The 1994 World Cup introduced the United States business world to the true scale of football\u2019s global popularity. It is not a coincidence that, by March 2003, the Glazers purchased their first tranche of shares in Manchester United. A new business trend had been set.The winning of the 2022 World Cup is meanwhile not just as one of the most influential moments in football history but also in the Middle East. Virtually every serious analyst on the area sees it as a direct cause of the Gulf blockade, and it clearly accelerated a sporting race between the involved countries.Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin, Turkey president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, UAE president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, Man City owner Sheikh Mansour and Man City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak (Getty Images)Other World Cups have had different effects, 2002 for example initiating changes in the calendar, but it was 1994 and 2022 that have contributed the two driving forces shaping football for the next seven years.One is western capitalism, mostly through US venture capitalists and private equity funds. The other is Gulf politics.It is inevitable that the most powerful competition in the world, the Premier League, showcases this. Half of next season\u2019s clubs have American owners with controlling influence. City and Newcastle United are owned by Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, respectively.The competition\u2019s biggest club, Manchester United, may fittingly become a juncture point in this if the Glazers take the immensely consequential - and equally controversial - decision to sell to Qatar. It would also largely illustrate how this works.Barcelona, \u2018economic levers\u2019 and the next phase of sportswashingMoney from the Gulf blockade countries is the dominant factor, since they are willing to pump in so much of it in all areas. It is within the gaps created by this dramatically expanding game that Western capitalists then exert their influence, picking off purchases where there is opportunity. You only have to look at the capital-raising deals Barcelona struck last summer to stay competitive, all from a world where they had their best executives and players picked off by City and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. La Liga itself pursued the deal with private equity group CVC to try and catch up with the Premier League, while Serie A has been looking at similar.There is a growing theory within the game that the next step in this will be sovereign wealth funds seeking to strike similar deals. That could completely change the power balance between domestic competitions, as one league could suddenly see many of its clubs inflated to Premier League level.It would be an entirely logical evolution from just buying clubs, in the way buying clubs was an evolution from sponsorships and staging events. The recent Saudi announcement of the Public Investment Fund privatising four of its clubs even offers a model.The current model of the game, a global pyramid that has been growing for over a century, is being chipped away at from all angles. Abu Dhabi\u2019s City currently sit at the peak, one which has been made narrower by the financial power required to get to that level. We have reached a point where it feels like only about eight clubs can win the Champions League, although Newcastle will surely join that group.Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Al Saud with Fifa President Gianni Infantino, and Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin at a 2018 World Cup match (Getty Images)Whether any others do may depend on some huge regulatory decisions. Moves like the Premier League capping spending or Uefa changing prize money rules could bring a badly needed increase in competitive balance. The role of the new English independent regulator is going to be instructive, too. Many football figures in other major countries are watching keenly, and believe the idea could spread. Some even think that would eventually pose a threat to Fifa in terms of removing some of the global body\u2019s power. If the independent regulator can actually prove effective in giving supporters increased stakes in clubs, it could serve to actually row some of this back; to put more of the game back in the hands of fans.The repercussions of the Premier League\u2019s charges against Manchester CityIt is also why so much hinges on the outcomes of the Premier League charges against Manchester City and the Spanish public prosecutor\u2019s charges against Barcelona. Both could change the face of the game and bring chain reactions.On the other side, a huge question is what Uefa\u2019s stance on multi-club models is going to be. While much of the focus on this is regarding American consortiums, the greatest relevance could be with sovereign wealth funds and states.Since there aren\u2019t actually that many states that want to buy clubs, such a change could facilitate multiple purchases by the same funds. Uefa president Aleksandr Ceferin\u2019s recent softening on this - at least in terms of public statements - has naturally been viewed through the prism of Qatar\u2019s interest in Manchester United with the state already owning PSG.That would pose huge questions of the game\u2019s actual values, given the persistent criticism from human rights groups as regards \u201csportswashing\u201d. This is also where private equity firms and other capitalist interests could further exert their influence. The intention of many of their club purchases is to flip them within five years after increasing the value. But, who will be able to afford such clubs? More private equity firms, perhaps. More state-linked groups, most likely.That could bring a world where the same state or sovereign wealth fund owns six clubs in the Champions League.The LIV Golf precedentIt is why Uefa\u2019s stance on this is so important. LIV Golf\u2019s recent deal with the PGA Tour nevertheless proves what one prominent federation executive told the Independent last year.Autocratic states have so much more money and such a greater will to spend it that sporting authorities can find themselves almost powerless without government backing. That leads many to decide \u201cit\u2019s ultimately better to work with these interests rather than have them working against you\u201d.A connected issue is how examples such as the LIV Golf case and City chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak\u2019s notorious line about \u201cthe 50 best lawyers\u201d show that such states can \u201cweaponise\u201d legal systems.The gradual purchase of sporting infrastructure has already led to a situation where PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has become one of the most powerful figures in football, rising to the top of the European Club Association.Such moves do always bring responses, though, and the Independent has been told that there is growing unease within the European Union about the influence of states and private equity funds. That is where government backing could be sparked.Otherwise, another unintended consequence of sporting bodies repeatedly allowing certain takeovers is the growth of particular voting blocs. That's where some very new ideas could come in. The Premier League is currently divided along a few lines, with the greatest split coming over City\u2019s charges.Manchester City celebrate lifting the Champions League in Istanbul  (AP)Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategy to host World Cup 2030Saudi Arabia have already been acutely aware of voting blocs ahead of that World Cup decision next year. They have made inroads into Europe through the inclusion of Greece in their bid. They have split north Africa through the inclusion of Egypt. There\u2019s a growing theory in the game they could split the emotional South American bid by bringing in Uruguay.It is a push that is only going to grow in the next year, as Mohamed bin Salman wants to make the World Cup the centrepiece of \u2018Vision 2030\u2019. All of this is why one figure in the game says it is to be the \u201cdecade of Saudi Arabia\u201d.RecommendedFootball rumours: Man United, Real Madrid and Chelsea fight for Kylian Mbappe\u2018Serial winners\u2019 can help England finally celebrate silverware \u2013 Tyrone MingsTyrone Mings on Jack Grealish\u2019s \u2018wild\u2019 celebrations and Unai Emery\u2019s simple adviceThis is another way the politics of the Gulf drives the game. It is not just the willingness to invest, but also the willingness for one-upmanship. There\u2019s a sense it wasn\u2019t a coincidence that Saudi Arabia made such expansion announcements and Qatar upped their attempt to buy Manchester United in the same week City were going to secure the treble.This is likely to be an indication of the next few years. It just could bring more change than anyone can imagine."}, {"_id": "6489ff8651ac3318d5fe4f05", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/miguel-delaney-newsletter-quiz-answers-b2077968.html", "primaryCategory": "Football", "subCategories": "test", "title": "The answers to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter quiz", "lead": "<p>Make sure you check on how you did with Miguel\u2019s weekly quiz which is exclusive to those signed up to his Reading the Game newsletter  </p>", "author": "The Independent", "datePublished": "Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:56:32 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:57:26.446689", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-14T07:56:32+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2021/10/19/22/PA-17303180.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up to Miguel Delaney\u2019s Reading the Game newsletter sent straight to your inbox for freeSign up to Miguel\u2019s Delaney\u2019s free weekly newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThere is a former Aston Villa captain who has been at the front and centre of celebrations of late. Not Tyrone Mings, admittedly, even though he helped his club qualify for Europe for the first time in 13 years as a season that began with him stripped of the armband and his place in the team ended with him a pivotal part of Unai Emery\u2019s remarkable revival.Villa clinched seventh place with a last-day win over Tottenham. \u201cAfter the final game I was in bed by about 11 o\u2019clock with a Ribena,\u201d said Mings wryly. \u201cOther juices obviously are available.\u201d Jack Grealish has tasted a few of them. The \u00a3100 million man has looked the party animal, enjoying Manchester City\u2019s treble with the relish he brings to much else. \u201cHe\u2019s had a great time, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d said Mings.A night out with his old Villa teammate Grealish, he can testify, is not for the faint-hearted. \u201cIt is extremely wild,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only thing he needs to do is do it at the right times and he\u2019s just won the treble so I don\u2019t think anybody can begrudge him going out and letting his hair down - those luscious locks of his now he has taken the hairband out. He\u2019s certainly had a good few days.\u201dManchester City\u2019s celebrations have carried on after their Champions League final victory  (Getty Images)Part of Grealish\u2019s appeal is that he can seem the likeable Jack the lad: unpolished, at times undiplomatic, but natural. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be yourself, whatever that looks like,\u201d Mings said. \u201cIt adds to the game and dressing room. It adds to the culture and authenticity is a tough trait to come across. Football is sometimes just a reflection of society, isn\u2019t it? Or like a reflection of everybody\u2019s life.\u201dRecommendedMarcus Rashford brushes off critics and insists he is committed to England\u2018Serial winners\u2019 can help England finally celebrate silverware \u2013 Tyrone MingsCity soak it in and Nuggets strike gold \u2013 Tuesday\u2019s sporting socialGrealish\u2019s seems more eventful than most. \u201cSurely he\u2019s all partied out,\u201d said the defender. They have been photographed on breaks abroad before but Mings was quick to draw a distinction. \u201cI\u2019ve bumped into him on holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never put myself in the position of where I\u2019ve actually flown out with him! But I\u2019ve seen him abroad - and many, many times in this country. It\u2019s impressive - if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into...\u201dHis own plans are more restrained. \u201cThe thing I love doing the most is running a normal life schedule,\u201d he said. \u201cLike going out for coffee in the morning, or training when you want to. Popping to the dry cleaners, stuff like that. Real mundane things, like pottering around the village.\u201dWhich he can do after a successful season. The summer of 2022 was bookended by disappointments for Mings: first a staple of Gareth Southgate\u2019s squads was dropped by England and then Steven Gerrard replaced him as Villa skipper with John McGinn and preferred new signing Diego Carlos for the opening-day defeat to Bournemouth.RecommendedJack Grealish says he hasn\u2019t slept for 24 hours as he revels in Man City victory paradeManchester City quintet set to arrive for England duty on Tuesday eveningJack Grealish revels as Manchester City parade treble\u201cI guess it started being left out of the England squad but that was a whole summer of strange times,\u201d he added. \u201cThen sitting on the bench at Bournemouth and thinking, \u2018I don\u2019t know how all of this has happened in such a short space of time\u2019; from the captaincy to not starting first game of the season.\u201dAnd yet the happy end to the campaign left him reflecting: \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t change the last 14 months since the last game of last season to where we are now. Sometimes need a kick up the backside, don\u2019t you?\u201d He had the honesty to accept Southgate was right to omit him. \u201cDid I need it? Probably,\u201d he said. \u201cThere always comes a stage in people\u2019s careers where there is a plateau and you are coasting.\u201dA change of fortune came in part with a change of manager. He was back in the Villa side before Gerrard was sacked, but was revitalised by Emery. While another England centre-back, John Stones, has shown a new dimension to his game by playing in midfield, Mings has benefited from being ordered not to desert his post in the middle of the defence by Emery.\u201cHe has made my job a lot simpler and a lot clearer,\u201d he said. \u201cI always go back to the first conversation that we had and he said every time he watched me, I ended up in centre midfield, left-wing, right-back or covering the other centre-back and all of that can happen within 60 seconds. He wanted me to play in my position, simplify what I have done and learn his methods.\u201dIf Mings has proved a star pupil, Southgate has taken note. But his role for England has not just been confined to defensive duties. Mings has found the net in his last two caps, against San Marino and Ivory Coast. \u201cWhat is the longest scoring streak for a defender for England?\u201d he wondered. \u201cTwo, probably.\u201d Score for a third consecutive game and he may find his friend Grealish celebrating.

I felt like I struggled a bit with my timing early on but I served well throughout the match and that helped me out. I think these courts play a bit more similar to how Wimbledon plays like in the second week, so hopefully I\u2019m in the second week there. The main thing for me at the moment is getting as many matches as possible and playing in different conditions against all different styles of opponent. He [De Loore] was a really big server and really went after his groundstrokes across the match, he made it tough so I\u2019m really glad to get through.\u201dThroughout the prime of his career the thought of Murray playing in Challenger events would have likely been unheard of, but in recent years the former world No.1 has appeared in several of the events to build form and improve his ranking following his hip resurfacing.Murray last played in Nottingham as a 19-year-old back in 2006 and his return has certainly been a welcome one, with packed stands across Centre Court for his opening round contest. (Getty Images for LTA)The ATP Challenger at the Nottingham Tennis Centre runs alongside a WTA 250-level event and though both tournaments are well backed by the LTA, Murray knows just how important strong public support is for some tournaments.He added: \u201cI think I played for the first time here when I was 15 or 16.\u201cI lost in qualifying to Bob Bryan, who\u2019s also had hip resurfacing as well, and I got to play in the doubles with Martin Lee here. I think the last time I was here was in 2006 and I think I lost to Andreas Seppi.\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant [to see the crowds], I love it.

Andrew Flintoff then clubbed 73 to set the target before taking a memorable four for 79.Australia were 137 for seven but Shane Warne fought back with 42 before treading on his stumps to give Flintoff his fourth wicket, and Brett Lee and Michael Kasprowicz produced a last-wicket stand of 59 which looked to be pushing Australia to a shock win and a 2-0 series lead.Umpire Billy Bowden, though, deemed Steve Harmison had Kasprowicz caught behind by Geraint Jones, leading the great commentator Richie Benaud to simply say \u201cJones\u2026 Bowden\u201d as the England celebrations unfolded.The handshake that followed as Flintoff dropped down to meet a devastated Lee on his haunches has become an indelible image in Ashes history.Barmy ArmyEngland\u2019s superb Edgbaston record runs alongside the fantastic support they get at the ground.The Hollies Stand is one of cricket\u2019s most vibrant places to watch the sport from and will witness the first Ashes airing of England supporters club the Barmy Army\u2019s new chant for Stuart Broad, written to the tune of Abba\u2019s Voulez-Vous.Broad\u2019s long-time rival David Warner is likely to be a prime target in his final Ashes but the Barmy Army\u2019s first Test guide stresses the need to avoid personal abuse.\u201cWe seek to be entertaining when singing and creating songs, not use offensive language and have good clean fun,\u201d the document reads, adding that membership can be removed \u201cwithout notice\u201d from any fan who oversteps the mark.Edgbaston heroesEngland\u2019s long-time opening bowling pair James Anderson and Stuart Broad have enjoyed tremendous records at Edgbaston and are the leading two wicket-takers at the venue.Anderson, expected to be fit after sitting out the warm-up game against Ireland, will look to add to his 51 wickets at an average of 22.62 in 13 previous Tests at Edgbaston.

But consciously or not, they\u2019re a way of putting down Charlotte and other women in the process. It\u2019s a clear act of negging (a pick-up artist technique where a person deliberately gives a backhanded compliment to undermine another\u2019s confidence): \u201cYou look good for 30, unlike those other wizened old hags your age.\u201d\u2018Love Island\u2019 bombshells Charlotte (left) and Leah (ITV)Sexism also underpins these comments. Charlotte is a beautiful and accomplished woman, but she can\u2019t be allowed to get big-headed about it, can she? No, there has to be an \u201cactually\u201d or a \u201cthough\u201d, putting her in her place. In a culture obsessed with women looking young, a woman who doesn\u2019t look her age, whether through good genetics, surgery, or a rigorous retinol-focused skincare routine, is seen as a winner, her accomplishment to be praised. Were a guy in his thirties to enter the villa, the girls would be all over him, praising him for his emotional maturity without scanning his face for crows feet.However, it becomes obvious these comments are pure, childish silliness when we realise that Leah, also falls into the \u201colder women\u201d category for these islanders, with Mitchel asking her if their age gap was going to be a problem. Mitchel, for the record, is 26. Leah is 27.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign upIt\u2019s only when you realise this that you realise you can\u2019t take anything on Love Island too seriously.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning writer died at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on Tuesday (13 June), his publisher, Knopf, said.His son, John McCarthy, has also confirmed his death.McCarthy won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2006 novel, The Road, a post-apocalyptic tale that follows a father and son embarking on a gruelling tale of survival, after a mysterious cataclyism wipes out almost all life and destroys civilisation. \u201cHe walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world,\u201d one passage reads. \u201cThe cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.\u201dRecommendedStephen King leads tributes to The Road author Cormac McCarthy: \u2018The greatest American novelist of my time\u2019Cormac McCarthy only signed 250 copies of The Road so son could sell them and \u2018go to Las Vegas\u2019Emile Hirsch on remorse, wanderlust and child stardom: \u2018I was wary of the dark underbelly of Hollywood\u2019His 2005 novel, No Country for Old Men, was set in remote Texas and detailed three characters involved in a drug deal that went badly wrong. It tackled themes including generation divides, where \u201ctraditional\u201d values of lawfulness, morality and justice were set against a new world order where it was every man for himself. \u201cYou think when you wake up in the mornin yesterday don\u2019t count,\u201d the character Moss says to a hitchhiker. \u201cBut yesterday is all that does count. What else is there? Your life is made out of the days it\u2019s made out of. Nothin else.\u201dThe book was adapted into a film by the Coen brothers, and went on to win four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Joel and Ethan Coen), Best Adapted Screenplay (Joel and Ethan Coen), and Best Supporting Actor (Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh).McCarthy was known for incorporating dark themes in his work, such as arson, rape, incest, necrophilia and cannibalism.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as life without bloodshed,\u201d he told The New York Times Magazine in 1992 in a rare interview. \u201cI think the notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is a really dangerous idea.\u201dThe author was also notoriously reclusive, making rare public appearances and only granting a handful of interviews throughout his career.\u201cIn recent years, I have had no desire to do anything but work and be with [my son] John,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal in 2009. \u201cI hear people talking about going on a vacation or something and I think, what is that about?

Cormac McCarthy in 2011 (Getty Images)McCarthy published his first novel, The Orchard Keeper, in 1965. He was later granted a MacArthur Fellowship, colloquially known as the \u201cGenius Grant\u201d, which he used to travel to the American Southwest.There, he researched and wrote his fifth novel, Blood Meridian (1985), which some consider his magnum opus.It wasn\u2019t until 1992 that McCarthy received widespread success with All the Pretty Horses, a story about a 16-year-old cowboy faced with difficult choices for his future. Compared to his previous work, the prose had more of a romantic quality that surprised some of his earlier fans. The book was adapted into a 2000 film starring Matt Damon and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and directed by Billy Bob Thornton.Famed horror author Stephen King paid tribute to his fellow writer, writing on Twitter: \u201cCormac McCarthy, maybe the greatest American novelist of my time, has passed away at 89.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThomas Turgoose recently came to a striking realisation: his career had come full circle. In 2005, the actor was just 13 when Shane Meadows plucked him from a Grimsby youth club to play This Is England\u2019s mouthy upstart Shaun. Naturally, there were concerns that Turgoose, who had no previous acting experience, might be left behind once the excitement had died down \u2013 but his co-stars assured him this would not be the case. \u201cI was made a promise by Stephen Graham and Vicky [McClure] that when This Is England was released, it wasn\u2019t just gonna be \u2018That\u2019s it.\u2019 They promised to stick by me and support me.\u201d They did. Eighteen years later, Turgoose found the situation reversed, and himself in the role of elder statesman.Meadows has enlisted the actor once again for The Gallows Pole, a new three-part series that ranks as one of the best BBC shows in years. For the project, which also features a bearded Michael Socha (who played This Is England\u2019s Harvey) and Sophie McShera (Downton Abbey), Meadows and casting director Shaheen Baig assembled a selection of unknowns for many of the supporting roles. They found Charlotte Ockelton, Soraya Jane Nabipour, and standout Stevie Binns. \u201cI remember my first time on set \u2013 I had no idea what I was doing and looked to people like Stephen,\u201d Turgoose recalls. \u201cBut now it\u2019s the reverse; they were asking me questions because I\u2019ve been doing it for almost 20 years. It was nice to be able to help and support them.\u201dTurgoose is a welcoming presence, with a gregariousness that could put the most anxious person at ease. He drinks tea from a mug as he chats. He\u2019s 31 now, but has a wisdom that suggests someone older, perhaps accentuated by the fact that he\u2019s married and has a two-year-old son. In his original audition for Shaun, he talked of doing \u201cnowt\u201d but \u201cgoing on bike rides and playing football\u201d. These days, he loves the contemplative sport of golf. There are still shades of Shaun, though, whom Turgoose went on to play in three This Is England TV projects from 2010 to 2015. He\u2019s had several roles since \u2013 a meth-taking yob in Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017), an obedient guard in sci-fi series Intergalactic (2021) \u2013 but he was particularly happy after receiving the call from Meadows.\u201cI met Shane for lunch, and he said he\u2019d found this book and that there was a part he\u2019d love me to play,\u201d Turgoose says. \u201cYou hear that so often from directors you meet at events, but when Shane said it, I believed him, and when he called me it was like the best Christmas present ever.\u201dThe Gallows Pole, a prequel to Benjamin Myers\u2019s 2017 novel of the same name, tells the true story of 18th-century Yorkshire villagers who launch a coin-forging operation to combat their poverty. Turgoose plays William Hartley, the younger brother of Socha\u2019s criminal leader, and for the actor, his professional reunion with Meadows afforded him a chance to show his mentor how he\u2019d evolved since his early years as an actor.RecommendedThe 50 greatest TV episodes of all time, from This is England to I May Destroy YouSuccession\u2019s tragic finale shows that TV can be as vital and profound as any work of art can hope forWoody Harrelson and Justin Theroux on new Watergate series White House Plumbers: \u2018It\u2019s absurd and ridiculous\u2019\u201cI think Shane saw a lot of himself in me when he was a kid, which is a great compliment,\u201d he says. The role was semi-autobiographical, with Shaun based on Meadows himself. \u201cI look up to him, not only as the greatest director I\u2019ll ever work with, but also who he is as a father and a husband \u2013 that\u2019s who I want to be. So, on a personal level, I wanted to show him I\u2019ve worked my arse off. I wanted to show him the man I\u2019ve become, and what I can do with a character.\u201dMeadows came into Turgoose\u2019s life just before a tumultuous adjustment period. In December 2005, the actor was living with his mum, Sharon, when she died of cancer. He immediately moved in with his dad, who he says \u201clived a totally different life\u201d to how he\u2019d been raised until that point.\u201cI was so far off the rails when I was a kid \u2013 there was almost no escape to where I was gonna end up,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI won\u2019t go into it too heavily, but there were things that I experienced when I was a kid that I will make sure my son never has to go through. When my mum passed away, that had such an effect on my life. The first thing my dad did was install a routine, and he got me into school. He taught me the values of money and respect.\u201dTurgoose and his co-stars in BBC Two masterpiece \u2018The Gallows Pole\u2019, which tells the story of 18th-century Yorkshire villagers who launch a coin-forging operation to combat their poverty (BBC/Element Pictures (GP) Limited/Objective Feedback LLC/Dean Rogers)Then, in 2007, This Is England was released to universal acclaim. The film is considered one of Meadows\u2019s best, and was a regular fixture on that year\u2019s \u201cBest of...\u201d lists. For his performance, Turgoose won the Most Promising Newcomer award at the British Independent Film Awards (BIFA). It wasn\u2019t until the actor turned 18, though, that his newfound fame began to affect his life in ways that were not entirely welcome.Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trialSign up\u201cWhen I was old enough to go out and drink, there were times I was out with my friends, and people were coming over all the time and asking for photos, which is lovely \u2013 I don\u2019t mind that, and I\u2019d never want it to stop \u2013 but sometimes, it got a bit tough,\u201d the actor says. \u201cI went through a stage where I felt guilty for not being able to enjoy my night as much as I could.\u201dMore recently, he\u2019s come across people who, rather than approaching him for a chat, merely take his photo and walk away. That\u2019s acceptable when he\u2019s alone, Turgoose says, but not when he\u2019s with his son. \u201cIf someone asks me for one, it\u2019s OK, but I\u2019ve had it when I\u2019m in a play area with my little boy and people are taking photos. It\u2019s borderline if you wanna take one of me without asking \u2013 I still think that\u2019s rude \u2013 but don\u2019t bring a baby into it.\u201dTurgoose acknowledges that it \u201ccomes with the territory\u201d, but was still left surprised when he was recognised by fans on his honeymoon in Mexico \u2013 not for This Is England, but for Game of Thrones. The reason for his confusion? He was in just one scene. The actor appeared opposite Maisie Williams\u2019s Arya Stark in the season seven premiere, playing one of three Lannister soldiers alongside Sean McGillicuddy and a man named Ed Sheeran. (Yes, that one.) Turgoose laughs at the memory.\u201cMy agent rang me and said, \u2018Great news \u2013 they\u2019ve offered you the role.\u2019 I was in the car, and I\u2019ve gone, \u2018I\u2019m buying a f***ing helicopter. That\u2019s it \u2013 we are set for life!\u2019 I asked when they were gonna send the rest of the script, and my agent went, \u2018No, it\u2019s just that one bit.\u2019 I was like, \u2018OK... I\u2019m not buying a helicopter.\u2019\u201dA young Turgoose on the set of \u2018This Is England\u2019 in 2006 (Adrian Rogers/Filmfour/UK Film Council/Kobal/Shutterstock)While the chopper might be on hold, Turgoose did recently get to experience his first taste of Hollywood: he scored a role in Mickey 17, Bong Joon-ho\u2019s first film since Best Picture winner Parasite, alongside Robert Pattinson and Toni Collette. But it was another of his co-stars, Mark Ruffalo, who particularly impressed him; in fact, he\u2019s gained a friend in the Marvel actor.\u201cHe\u2019ll text me at weekends about the Grimsby Town results,\u201d Turgoose says, incredulously. \u201cI had the actual Hulk singing Grimsby football chants! He\u2019s one of the biggest stars in the world \u2013 but he wanted to go to Wagamama every night.\u201dTurgoose wrapped the film in January, and plans to enjoy a relaxed summer playing golf as well as watching \u2013 and rewatching \u2013 Toy Story with his young son. I ask, somewhat hopefully, if a new This Is England series has been mooted. Turgoose himself says he\u2019d \u201clove to\u201d return, but has concerns that an onscreen reunion might not \u201cpan out\u201d so well.RecommendedThe Gallows Pole is a very self-consciously different kind of period drama7 hidden gem TV series to watch on Apple TV+Josh Hartnett on working with Christopher Nolan 20 years after saying no to Batman\u201cWe\u2019re all so different,\u201d he says of his cast mates, whom he still speaks to regularly. \u201cWe all used to love going out and getting wasted \u2013 and that was part of the magic of the show.

Bored Gay Werewolf by Tony Santorella is published in hardback by Atlantic Books, priced \u00a314.99 (ebook \u00a36.99). Available nowTony Santorella\u2019s debut has hints of darkness, but is still easy to read and funny. Our lead is Brian \u2013 the Bored Gay Werewolf in question. A mid-20s college dropout, who works in a cafe bar by day, and meets men on Grindr and finds the odd victim by night. When he meets fellow lycanthrope and life coach Tyler, Brian starts to make some silly mistakes in his wolf form, and Tyler sets up a support group for others like them. Equipped with a set of mantras and instructions for self-care as the next full moon approaches, Brian begins to learn more about his \u2018anger-management\u2019 issues. As he withdraws from his cafe friends and wraps himself in the cult-like embrace of Tyler and his pack, he becomes aware of something much darker. A fun read, perfect for Pride month and those who love non-serious coming-of-age tales.8/10(Review by Rachel Howdle)RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live2. A Death In The Parish by Reverend Richard Coles is published in hardback by W&N, priced \u00a318.99 (ebook \u00a37.99). Available nowAfter the runaway success of his debut cosy crime caper Murder Before Evensong, the celebrity vicar, broadcaster and writer is back with the second in the Canon Clement series, set in a sleepy English village in the late 1980s. In the latest instalment, the parish of Champton is joined by two neighbouring parishes and their associate vicar, an evangelical keen to put his stamp on the place. When a wayward teenager is found with his throat slashed in an abandoned chapel in what initially seems like a ritualistic killing, Canon Daniel Clement, rector of Champton, sets out to solve the mystery, surrounded by a clutch of familiar characters. The plot features some unexpected twists and points of reflection in an era before there were women priests, and explores the huge differences in attitudes among clergy. A good holiday read, with much gentle humour peppered among the village characters, despite the nature of the crime.8/10(Review by Hannah Stephenson)3. The Girls Of Summer by Katie Bishop is published in hardback by Bantam, priced \u00a314.99 (ebook \u00a37.99). Available nowThe Girls Of Summer is very much a book of the #MeToo era, exploring grey areas of consent and looking at abuses of power. Set between the past \u2013 where 17-year-old Rachel visits a Greek island and starts a relationship with a much older man \u2013 and the present, where an unhappily married Rachel struggles through life, looking back at the past with rose-tinted glasses, but increasingly realising it might not be what she thought. Rachel \u2018loved\u2019 Alistair, so she blocks out all the awful things that happened \u2013 including being drugged and raped by his boss and other wealthy men. Despite the summery setting, the content is understandably grim \u2013 but it\u2019s written like a thriller, so you\u2019ll keep wanting to the turn the page. Pacy and readable, it\u2019s set to be a big summer hit.7/10(Review by Prudence Wade)Non-fiction4. Animal Liberation Now by Peter Singer is published in hardback by Bodley Head, priced \u00a320 (ebook \u00a39.99). Available nowWith praise from primatologist Jane Goodall and actor Joaquin Phoenix and a foreward by historian Yuval Noah Harari, Peter Singer\u2019s updated version of Animal Liberation is highly anticipated. The seminal book was originally published in 1975, and Animal Liberation Now has been almost entirely rewritten to reflect the issues of today. Singer\u2019s revelations around protecting animals were radical in the Seventies, but are much more widely accepted today. This version reflects the progress that has been made in a world where veganism is much more common, and yet our environment is on the brink of collapse, and new issues \u2013 such as lab-grown meat and changes to factory farming \u2013 have come to the fore. As a philosopher, Singer\u2019s style is in-depth and quite academic, but there\u2019s a reason Animal Liberation hasn\u2019t gone out of print since the Seventies \u2013 he makes a persuasive argument, and one that\u2019s now better suited to our times.8/10(Review by Prudence Wade)Children\u2019s book of the week5. My Heart Was A Tree by Michael Morpurgo, illustrated by Yuval Zommer, is published in hardback by Two Hoots, priced \u00a316.99 (ebook \u00a37.99). Available nowThis is a heartwarming, funny and sometimes educational book that will appeal to all ages. It\u2019s a collection of poems and stories covering the life of a tree, from seed onwards \u2013 how it grows and the benefits to man, the planet and animals alike. One of the poems shows the lifeline of a tree and how it evolves, one tree dropping its seed and being picked up and carried by a bird to reseed elsewhere. This enables the tree it to have nine different lives, eventually ending up as driftwood to make a chair. One of the short stories is about a white stag living in the woods, covering several themes, including friendship, loyalty and love. The book is a delight to read, and the colourful illustrations enhance the total experience. It will provide hours of joy, during which you can clearly see the writer\u2019s love of trees.(Review by Joanne Brennan)9/10BOOK CHARTS FOR THE WEEK ENDING JUNE 10HARDBACK (FICTION)1.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning writer died at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on Tuesday (13 June), his publisher, Knopf, said.His son, John McCarthy, has also confirmed his death.McCarthy won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2006 novel, The Road, a post-apocalyptic tale that follows a father and son embarking on a gruelling tale of survival, after a mysterious cataclyism wipes out almost all life and destroys civilisation. \u201cHe walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world,\u201d one passage reads. \u201cThe cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.\u201dRecommendedStephen King leads tributes to The Road author Cormac McCarthy: \u2018The greatest American novelist of my time\u2019Cormac McCarthy only signed 250 copies of The Road so son could sell them and \u2018go to Las Vegas\u2019Emile Hirsch on remorse, wanderlust and child stardom: \u2018I was wary of the dark underbelly of Hollywood\u2019His 2005 novel, No Country for Old Men, was set in remote Texas and detailed three characters involved in a drug deal that went badly wrong. It tackled themes including generation divides, where \u201ctraditional\u201d values of lawfulness, morality and justice were set against a new world order where it was every man for himself. \u201cYou think when you wake up in the mornin yesterday don\u2019t count,\u201d the character Moss says to a hitchhiker. \u201cBut yesterday is all that does count. What else is there? Your life is made out of the days it\u2019s made out of. Nothin else.\u201dThe book was adapted into a film by the Coen brothers, and went on to win four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Joel and Ethan Coen), Best Adapted Screenplay (Joel and Ethan Coen), and Best Supporting Actor (Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh).McCarthy was known for incorporating dark themes in his work, such as arson, rape, incest, necrophilia and cannibalism.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as life without bloodshed,\u201d he told The New York Times Magazine in 1992 in a rare interview. \u201cI think the notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is a really dangerous idea.\u201dThe author was also notoriously reclusive, making rare public appearances and only granting a handful of interviews throughout his career.\u201cIn recent years, I have had no desire to do anything but work and be with [my son] John,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal in 2009. \u201cI hear people talking about going on a vacation or something and I think, what is that about? I have no desire to go on a trip. My perfect day is sitting in a room with some blank paper. That\u2019s heaven. That\u2019s gold and anything else is just a waste of time.\u201dMcCarthy was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on July 20, 1933, one of six children in an Irish Catholic family.He grew up mostly in Tennessee, enrolling in the state university in 1951 before dropping out to join the US Air Force. Cormac McCarthy in 2011 (Getty Images)McCarthy published his first novel, The Orchard Keeper, in 1965. He was later granted a MacArthur Fellowship, colloquially known as the \u201cGenius Grant\u201d, which he used to travel to the American Southwest.There, he researched and wrote his fifth novel, Blood Meridian (1985), which some consider his magnum opus.It wasn\u2019t until 1992 that McCarthy received widespread success with All the Pretty Horses, a story about a 16-year-old cowboy faced with difficult choices for his future. Compared to his previous work, the prose had more of a romantic quality that surprised some of his earlier fans. The book was adapted into a 2000 film starring Matt Damon and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and directed by Billy Bob Thornton.Famed horror author Stephen King paid tribute to his fellow writer, writing on Twitter: \u201cCormac McCarthy, maybe the greatest American novelist of my time, has passed away at 89.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeReleased in 1997, Peter Cataneo\u2019s The Full Monty told the story of six men who decide to be strippers \u2013 but it was also about so much more.The film, set in Sheffield during the 1990s, was celebrated for its exploration of a number of social issues, including depression, body image and unemployment.On Wednesday 14 June, a sequel series arrives on Disney+ in the UK (and Hulu in the US). Set 25 years after the original film, The Full Monty (2023) sees its characters contend with a Britain that has changed significantly over the years.A number of the show\u2019s stars have spoken out about what fans can expect from the series\u2019 exploration of Conservative-driven austerity. Asked if the political thrust of the original film had been retained for the sequel, star Robert Carlyle said: \u201cAbsolutely. In that respect, it\u2019s exactly the same. And congratulations to Disney for going along with that. You cannot separate politics from The Full Monty. It\u2019s impossible.\u201dRecommended\u2018Nasty\u2019: The Idol viewers horrified by The Weeknd\u2019s dialogue during Lily-Rose Depp sex sceneElliot Page says he got shingles on Inception around Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom HardyEscape to the Chateau stars \u2018to wind down\u2019 French castle business weeks after leak of foul-mouthed audioHe continued: \u201cThese men, 25 years on, have lived through what everybody in this country has lived through, 25 years, near enough, of austerity. Their whole being has been chipped away, the whole infrastructure of the country has been chipped away. And that\u2019s there for sure.\u201dThe first episode of the series is titled \u201cLevelling Up\u201d, a reference to the policy of that name first laid out in the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto. The policy ostensibly aims to reduce economic inequality across different regions of the UK.Robert Carlyle in \u2018The Full Monty' (Disney)However, in The Full Monty, the ruinous effects of prolonged austerity come under the microscope, and the vision of modern-day Sheffield is far from rosy.The working men\u2019s club that featured prominntly in the original film is seen boarded up. In a review of the series for The Telegraph, Michael Hogan wrote: \u201cThe surprise box-office hit was always politically charged, tracing as it did the fallout from the deindustrialisation of Sheffield, and this eight-part sequel wears its politics on its sleeve too.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeReleased in 1997, Peter Cataneo\u2019s The Full Monty told the story of six men who decide to be strippers \u2013 but it was also about so much more.The film, set in Sheffield during the 1990s, was celebrated for its exploration of a number of social issues, including depression, body image and unemployment.On Wednesday 14 June, a sequel series arrives on Disney+ in the UK (and Hulu in the US). Set 25 years after the original film, The Full Monty (2023) sees its characters contend with a Britain that has changed significantly over the years.A number of the show\u2019s stars have spoken out about what fans can expect from the series\u2019 exploration of Conservative-driven austerity. Asked if the political thrust of the original film had been retained for the sequel, star Robert Carlyle said: \u201cAbsolutely. In that respect, it\u2019s exactly the same. And congratulations to Disney for going along with that. You cannot separate politics from The Full Monty. It\u2019s impossible.\u201dRecommended\u2018Nasty\u2019: The Idol viewers horrified by The Weeknd\u2019s dialogue during Lily-Rose Depp sex sceneElliot Page says he got shingles on Inception around Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom HardyEscape to the Chateau stars \u2018to wind down\u2019 French castle business weeks after leak of foul-mouthed audioHe continued: \u201cThese men, 25 years on, have lived through what everybody in this country has lived through, 25 years, near enough, of austerity. Their whole being has been chipped away, the whole infrastructure of the country has been chipped away. And that\u2019s there for sure.\u201dThe first episode of the series is titled \u201cLevelling Up\u201d, a reference to the policy of that name first laid out in the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto. The policy ostensibly aims to reduce economic inequality across different regions of the UK.Robert Carlyle in \u2018The Full Monty' (Disney)However, in The Full Monty, the ruinous effects of prolonged austerity come under the microscope, and the vision of modern-day Sheffield is far from rosy.The working men\u2019s club that featured prominntly in the original film is seen boarded up. In a review of the series for The Telegraph, Michael Hogan wrote: \u201cThe surprise box-office hit was always politically charged, tracing as it did the fallout from the deindustrialisation of Sheffield, and this eight-part sequel wears its politics on its sleeve too.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeShould Warner Bros have shelved The Flash? I\u2019m honestly not sure I have an answer. The accounts of its star, Ezra Miller, and their two-year downward spiral \u2013 which include allegations of harassment, grooming and physical violence \u2013 is distressing in a way that extends beyond all critical analysis. What needs to come, before even the matter of accountability, is the question of why there was no support system in place. Why was no one empowered either with the tools or with the moral imperative to intervene in a situation where an individual was in such a clearly dangerous state?There\u2019s no real sense that anyone would be helped by either the release or the cancellation of Miller\u2019s movie. In both scenarios, Warner Bros gets to shrug all responsibility and focus on the fate of its product and not the people it employs. And though the actor is (as their representatives stress) currently seeking treatment, the hand-wringing over a proposed sequel brings with it the perverse implication that said treatment will end not when medical professionals say so, but when Hollywood decides it\u2019s time for Miller to go back to work.The Flash, which has been in active development for nearly a decade, now also arrives after the announcement that DC\u2019s new leadership, Peter Safran and James Gunn, will largely be starting over from scratch. Farewell to 10 years of impotent franchise blueprints. It means that the film arriving here is an odd one \u2013 muddled and uncertain of its own identity, coloured by outside circumstance, but oddly poignant at times. It\u2019s stuck somewhere in between cynical fan service and a more sincere yearning to create art out of corporate strategising.Much of that division is inherent to its plot, which sees The Flash, aka Barry Allen, on an intimate journey of metaphysical implications. Barry, when we first meet him, is frustrated by his place in the superhero pantheon, having essentially become \u201cthe janitor of the Justice League\u201d and left to clean up Batman\u2019s (Ben Affleck) messes. He\u2019s also pained by his inability to prove his father (Ron Livingston) innocent of the murder of his mother (Maribel Verd\u00fa).

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeShould Warner Bros have shelved The Flash? I\u2019m honestly not sure I have an answer. The accounts of its star, Ezra Miller, and their two-year downward spiral \u2013 which include allegations of harassment, grooming and physical violence \u2013 is distressing in a way that extends beyond all critical analysis. What needs to come, before even the matter of accountability, is the question of why there was no support system in place. Why was no one empowered either with the tools or with the moral imperative to intervene in a situation where an individual was in such a clearly dangerous state?There\u2019s no real sense that anyone would be helped by either the release or the cancellation of Miller\u2019s movie. In both scenarios, Warner Bros gets to shrug all responsibility and focus on the fate of its product and not the people it employs. And though the actor is (as their representatives stress) currently seeking treatment, the hand-wringing over a proposed sequel brings with it the perverse implication that said treatment will end not when medical professionals say so, but when Hollywood decides it\u2019s time for Miller to go back to work.The Flash, which has been in active development for nearly a decade, now also arrives after the announcement that DC\u2019s new leadership, Peter Safran and James Gunn, will largely be starting over from scratch. Farewell to 10 years of impotent franchise blueprints. It means that the film arriving here is an odd one \u2013 muddled and uncertain of its own identity, coloured by outside circumstance, but oddly poignant at times. It\u2019s stuck somewhere in between cynical fan service and a more sincere yearning to create art out of corporate strategising.Much of that division is inherent to its plot, which sees The Flash, aka Barry Allen, on an intimate journey of metaphysical implications. Barry, when we first meet him, is frustrated by his place in the superhero pantheon, having essentially become \u201cthe janitor of the Justice League\u201d and left to clean up Batman\u2019s (Ben Affleck) messes. He\u2019s also pained by his inability to prove his father (Ron Livingston) innocent of the murder of his mother (Maribel Verd\u00fa). And so he uses his powers to, as Cher would put it, turn back time. But that screws up the space-time continuum in the process \u2013 leading Barry to cross paths with a younger version of himself that\u2019s never experienced any of the same loss or any of the same heroics.Screenwriter Christina Hodson, who also wrote DC\u2019s Birds of Prey, is thankfully able to tease some of the humanity out of this meta-human.

The twist? Each episode is told from the perspective of a different character, Rashomon style. One version is told in the style of a romcom, another in the style of an action film \u2013 y ou get the gist. What makes this premise sizzle is the comic pedigree of its ensemble cast, which includes Sam Richardson (Veep; Detroiters), Zo\u00eb Chao (Strangers), Ben Schwartz (Parks and Recreation), Ilana Glazer (Broad City) and Jamie Demetriou (Stath Lets Flats).

Loosely adapted from the 2017 film How to be a Latin Lover, the series follows the rags-to-riches story of self-made mogul Maximo Gallardo Ramos (Eugenio Derbez), much of which takes place in 1984 via flashback. After two roundly well-received seasons in 2021 and 2022, Acapulco was renewed for a third run of episodes earlier this year.My Kind of CountryReality TV has rightly been getting a bad rap lately, with singing competitions such as The X Factor or Britain\u2019s Got Talent coming under fire for their harsh treatment of contestants. This Reese Witherspoon and Kacey Musgraves-produced talent show, however, is a welcome respite. Judges Jimmie Allen, Mickey Guyton and Orville Peck nurture a roster of aspiring country singers through the rounds of this uplifting series, which subverts a lot of problematic time-worn trends about who gets to become a country music star.PlatonicIn Platonic, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play Will and Sylvia, two former best friends who reconnect in their early 40s after Will gets a divorce. There\u2019s much to like about this sitcom, which plays out with a Nora Ephron-esque lightness of touch. Rogen and Byrne, who formerly starred together in Bad Neighbours, make for an electric \u2013 and, as the title asserts, platonic \u2013 couple, while the series itself has plenty to say about life, relationships and ageing.Just friends: Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen in \u2018Platonic\u2019 (Apple TV+)Little AmericaDeveloped by The Big Sick\u2019s husband-wife team of Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V Gordon alongside Jury Duty\u2019s Lee Eisenberg, this anthology drama series follows true stories rooted in the American immigrant experience.

The Pulitzer Prize-winning writer died at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico on Tuesday (13 June), his publisher, Knopf, said.His son, John McCarthy, has also confirmed his death.McCarthy won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2006 novel, The Road, a post-apocalyptic tale that follows a father and son embarking on a gruelling tale of survival, after a mysterious cataclyism wipes out almost all life and destroys civilisation. \u201cHe walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world,\u201d one passage reads. \u201cThe cold relentless circling of the intestate earth. Darkness implacable. The blind dogs of the sun in their running. The crushing black vacuum of the universe. And somewhere two hunted animals trembling like ground-foxes in their cover. Borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it.\u201dRecommendedStephen King leads tributes to The Road author Cormac McCarthy: \u2018The greatest American novelist of my time\u2019Cormac McCarthy only signed 250 copies of The Road so son could sell them and \u2018go to Las Vegas\u2019Emile Hirsch on remorse, wanderlust and child stardom: \u2018I was wary of the dark underbelly of Hollywood\u2019His 2005 novel, No Country for Old Men, was set in remote Texas and detailed three characters involved in a drug deal that went badly wrong. It tackled themes including generation divides, where \u201ctraditional\u201d values of lawfulness, morality and justice were set against a new world order where it was every man for himself. \u201cYou think when you wake up in the mornin yesterday don\u2019t count,\u201d the character Moss says to a hitchhiker. \u201cBut yesterday is all that does count. What else is there? Your life is made out of the days it\u2019s made out of. Nothin else.\u201dThe book was adapted into a film by the Coen brothers, and went on to win four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Joel and Ethan Coen), Best Adapted Screenplay (Joel and Ethan Coen), and Best Supporting Actor (Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh).McCarthy was known for incorporating dark themes in his work, such as arson, rape, incest, necrophilia and cannibalism.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as life without bloodshed,\u201d he told The New York Times Magazine in 1992 in a rare interview. \u201cI think the notion that the species can be improved in some way, that everyone could live in harmony, is a really dangerous idea.\u201dThe author was also notoriously reclusive, making rare public appearances and only granting a handful of interviews throughout his career.\u201cIn recent years, I have had no desire to do anything but work and be with [my son] John,\u201d he told the Wall Street Journal in 2009. \u201cI hear people talking about going on a vacation or something and I think, what is that about? I have no desire to go on a trip. My perfect day is sitting in a room with some blank paper. That\u2019s heaven. That\u2019s gold and anything else is just a waste of time.\u201dMcCarthy was born in Providence, Rhode Island, on July 20, 1933, one of six children in an Irish Catholic family.He grew up mostly in Tennessee, enrolling in the state university in 1951 before dropping out to join the US Air Force. Cormac McCarthy in 2011 (Getty Images)McCarthy published his first novel, The Orchard Keeper, in 1965. He was later granted a MacArthur Fellowship, colloquially known as the \u201cGenius Grant\u201d, which he used to travel to the American Southwest.There, he researched and wrote his fifth novel, Blood Meridian (1985), which some consider his magnum opus.It wasn\u2019t until 1992 that McCarthy received widespread success with All the Pretty Horses, a story about a 16-year-old cowboy faced with difficult choices for his future. Compared to his previous work, the prose had more of a romantic quality that surprised some of his earlier fans. The book was adapted into a 2000 film starring Matt Damon and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and directed by Billy Bob Thornton.Famed horror author Stephen King paid tribute to his fellow writer, writing on Twitter: \u201cCormac McCarthy, maybe the greatest American novelist of my time, has passed away at 89.

This section of the coast is backed by lush greenery and vast limestone cliffs that have been eroded to create magnificent rock formations, including Elephant Rock and Lion\u2019s Paw. While there are toilets and a cafe on the beach, the town of Portrush itself is worthy of a visit as a great Northern Irish seaside resort. In addition to several other beaches, the town has an impressive range of things to do, from small theme parks to walks along sections of the Causeway Coast Way. Helen\u2019s Bay, County DownAn aerial photo of the beach at Helen\u2019s Bay (Getty Images)Helen\u2019s Bay itself is a village near Bangor, with a beach, local golf course and the Crawfordsburn County Park (home to woodland areas, fields and footpaths). On the beach, calm and clean waters meet gently sloping sands to provide good, safe swimming opportunities, making it a popular place for swimming clubs and families. The village itself is small, but is only four miles from Bangor, the newest city in Ireland. While it only received its status last December (as part of the late Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Platinum Jubilee civic awards), Bangor has long been a popular seaside resort, with its castle and marina among the main attractions. Ballycastle Beach, County Antrim Part of the coast near Ballycastle  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Ballycastle is another beach in the north, not far from Portrush and Portstewart. Regarded as a good place for swimming and surfing, it runs from the marina to Pans Rocks, a popular fishing spot around one mile away. Quieter and more accessible than some of the other beaches on this list, it also possesses amazing views out to sea and of Rathlin Island (which can be reached via regular 30-minute ferry journeys).The town sits east of Portrush, close to the Giant\u2019s Causeway, one of the country\u2019s most-visited sites. While seeing the Causeway is definitely a recommended trip, Ballycastle is also close to Downpatrick Head (a scenic geological site on the Wild Atlantic Way) and part of the Nine Glens of Antrim (a series of valleys). Its charming marina area is an option for relaxing by the water in town. Whitepark Bay, County Antrim Whitepark Bay is another gem along the Causeway Coast  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)Found in a secluded spot along the Causeway Coast, Whitepark Bay (sometimes written as White Park Bay) is even closer to the Giant\u2019s Causeway than Ballycastle, but offers a welcome retreat from seaside resort towns and swarms of people. Flanked by both steadily rising hills and limestone cliffs \u2013 and backed by dozens of ancient dunes \u2013 its sweeping white sands stretch for over a mile between Portbradden and Ballintoy, two small fishing villages. Its seclusion means that there are no real facilities, but the payoff is an abundance of peace and tranquility (but beware of swimming due to rip currents). Both nearby villages are tiny (Bllintoy had a population of 150 people in the 2011 census)\u00a0but offer spectacular views that would normally be reserved for Caribbean or Mediterranean destinations \u2013 Ballintoy\u2019s harbour was even used as a filming location for Game of Thrones\u2019 Lordsport. Murlough Beach, County DownMurlough Beach sits at the foot of the Mourne Mountains  (Getty Images/iStockphoto)The area around this beach \u2013 now named the Murlough Nature Reserve \u2013 became Northern Ireland\u2019s first nature reserve in 1967. It is now managed by the National Trust, and today boasts a 6,000-year-old sand dune system and network of paths to add to the four-mile stretch of coastline. Part of the beach is nestled near the foot of the Mourne Mountains, with much of its golden sand overlooked by Slieve Donard, the highest point in Northern Ireland. Water sports and walking are popular here, with the Dundrum Coastal Path among the popular routes.

The spot is close to one of the deepest areas of the Mediterranean Sea.It was unclear how many passengers might still be in the water or trapped in the sunken vessel, but some initial reports suggested hundreds of people may have been on board.The Greek coast guard said 79 bodies have been recovered so far. It said the survivors included 30 people from Egypt, 10 from Pakistan, 35 from Syria and 2 Palestinians.Twenty-five survivors were taken to hospital with symptoms of hypothermia. At the southern port of Kalamata, around 70 exhausted survivors bedded down in sleeping bags and blankets provided by rescuers in a large warehouse, while outside paramedics set up tents for anyone who needed first aid.RecommendedTravel firms say Brexit is blocking UK workers from being EU chalet hostsGreece: 32 migrants dead, more than 100 rescued after fishing vessel capsizesWreck of British WWII special-ops submarine found after decades-long searchKaterina Tsata, head of a Red Cross volunteer group in Kalamata, said the migrants were also given psychological support. \"They suffered a very heavy blow, both physical and mental,\" she said.Six coast guard vessels, a navy frigate, a military transport plane, an air force helicopter, several private vessels and a drone from the European Union border protection agency, Frontex, were taking part in the ongoing search. The United Nations migration agency, IOM, said initial reports suggested up to 400 people were on board. A network of activists said it received a distress call from a boat in the same area whose passengers said 750 people were on board \u2014 but it was not clear if that was the vessel that sank.\"It is not safe to give a number. We do not know how many people were in the hold,\" coast guard spokesperson Nikos Alexiou told Greece's MEGA TV. \"There were too many people on the outer deck. It was full.\"Survivors arrive at the port in Kalamata  (www.argolikeseidhseis.gr via AP)The Greek president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, visited the area where rescued migrants are being tended to, and political parties called off planned campaign events ahead of national elections later this month.The Italy-bound boat is believed to have sailed from the Tobruk area in eastern Libya. The Italian coast guard first alerted Greek authorities and the European Union border protection agency, Frontex, about the approaching vessel on Tuesday.After that first alert, Frontex aircraft and two merchant ships spotted the boat heading north at high speed, according to the Greek coast guard. More aircraft and ships were sent to the area. But repeated calls to the vessel offering help were declined, the coast guard said in a statement.\"In the afternoon a merchant vessel approached the ship and provided it with food and supplies, while the [passengers] refused any further assistance,\" it said. A second merchant ship that approached it later offered further supplies and assistance, which were turned down, it added.In the evening, a coast guard patrol boat reached the vessel \"and confirmed the presence of a large number of migrants on the deck,\" the statement said. \"But they refused any assistance and said they wanted to continue to Italy.\" The coast guard boat accompanied the vessel, which, the statement said, capsized and sank early Wednesday, prompting a massive rescue operation by all the ships in the area.Alarm Phone, a network of activists that provides a hotline for refugees and migrants in trouble, meanwhile, said it was contacted by people on a boat in distress on Tuesday afternoon. That boat was in the same general area as the one that sank, but it was not clear if it was the same vessel.The organisation notified Greek authorities and Frontex. In one communication with Alarm Phone, those on the vessel reported that it was overcrowded and that the captain had abandoned the ship on a small boat, according to the group. They asked for food and water, which was provided by a merchant ship.Libyan authorities have launched a major crackdown on migrants earlier this month across eastern Libya. Activists have said several thousand migrants, including Egyptians, Syrians, Sudanese and Pakistanis, have been detained. Libyan authorities deported many Egyptians to their home country through a land crossing point.In western Libya, authorities have raided migrant hubs in the capital, Tripoli, and other towns over the past few weeks. At least 1,800 migrants were detained and taken to government-run detention centers, according to the U.N. refugee agency.Mediterranean smugglers are increasingly taking larger boats into international waters off the Greek mainland to try to avoid local coast guard patrols. On Sunday, 90 migrants on a US-flagged yacht were rescued in the area after they made a distress call. Separately, on Wednesday, a yacht with 81 migrants on board was towed to a port on the south coast of Greece's island of Crete after authorities received a distress call.Greece is one of the main routes into the European Union for refugees and migrants from the Middle East, Asia and Africa.

The sand gets its bright hue from the shells of micro-organisms that live in the shallows, which are crushed by currents and mixed with the sand.People are forbidden to step foot on the beach, though the coast can be seen from the sea while on boat trips. While the ban was first introduced more than 30 years ago, it\u2019s going to be enforced with greater rigour due to fears the beach could be ruined.Fabrizio Fonnesu, director of the Maddalena archipelago national park, told The Times: \u201cThe beach is again in danger as people arrive by boat, clamber up the beach, then post photos.\u201dRecommendedSecurity staff at Heathrow airport to strike for 31 days over the summerAirbnb sues New York City over restrictions on short-term rentalsTourists could be banned from Bali\u2019s mountains due to bad behaviourThe higher fines are for those who take sand from the beaches.

But as well as quantity, the quality\u2019s there, too; the dishes were presented beautifully and the flavours were well-balanced.I went for the quesadilla (not very French, but c\u2019est la vie!), filled with vegan chilli and topped with herby chimichurri and a creme fraiche/sour cream concoction that finished it all off perfectly, alongside a tasty side salad.We sat streetside to take in some Sunday morning people-watching, but inside you\u2019ll find vegan-friendly bakery items, like the usual croissants and pain au chocolat, plus cakes that you can pre-order.There\u2019s a whole fashion shopping section too featuring vegan-friendly brands such as Matt + Nat, and a vegan mini-supermarket with pantry items, frozen goods and herbs and spices, as well as drinks.

Pain au chocolat, quiches, apricot and pistachio tarts, chocolate gateaux and cookies sat alongside \u2018bacon and cheese\u2019 and Mediterranean veggie baguettes if you fancied a little picnic in le parc.The prices were affordable too, with a pain au chocolat costing just over \u20ac1; on the day we left Paris, we bought six to bring home.

We took a seat outside and a waitress popped out to say hello \u2013 the fellow Scot I mentioned earlier. She explained near enough everything on the menu could be made vegan, and even made us a list of other eateries around the city to try.On the menu you\u2019ll find bowls, cakes and brunch bites, such as avocado toast, which comes served with vegan feta, nuts and edible flowers, plus tofu salad bowls, mac and cheese, plant burgers and scrambled tofu.Some dishes can also be made keto and paleo-friendly and gluten-free.MonoprixBest for: On-the-go eatsLocation: Multiple spots around the city, including near Luxembourg GardensSupermarket chain Monoprix is like our version of Tesco Express, and while not perfect by any measure \u2013 we didn\u2019t manage to find vegan eats in every location \u2013 we did come across a vegan wrap with a substitute chicken, crunchy slaw and a creamy mayo which was great for filling up after doing a lot of walking around the city.They also do good ready-made salad and salad bar options, such as a green lentil salad or mezze bowl with falafel, hummus and leaves.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman has filmed herself crying in the toilet of a plane after battling sickness for a 15-hour flight due to a \u201cpastry mix-up\u201d that saw Emirates allegedly serve her the \u201cwrong\u201d croissant.Chlo\u00eb Chapdelaine, 25, who suffers from coeliac disease, ordered a gluten-free in-flight meal ahead of a recent 15-hour flight from Dubai to Los Angeles, California, on Monday 5 June.When she received her meal, the 25-year-old influencer was excited to receive what appeared to be a gluten-free continental breakfast, which was served on a tray labelled \u201cgluten-free\u201d an hour into the flight.However, after eating half of the plain croissant provided with her meal, which didn\u2019t carry a gluten-free sticker, Chapdelaine decided to confirm with a flight attendant that it was indeed gluten-free. An air hostess ultimately confirmed it wasn\u2019t gluten-free, according to Chapdelaine, with footage dubbed \u201cthe worst flight of my life\u201d showing the content creator inside the airplane bathroom explaining what had happened as she tried to make herself throw up.RecommendedBride sparks outrage after documenting everything she ate at her weddingPlane passengers \u2018left without food and water\u2019 after emergency landing, woman claims\u2018It\u2019s an endurance test\u2019: Jayde Adams on what it\u2019s really like to be a plus-size travellerAfter spending an hour throwing up, Chapdelaine said she spent the remainder of the flight feeling nauseous and suffering from bad stomach cramps and diarrhoea.She also claimed she suffered with itchy skin, and said she\u2019ll have to cope with the \u201cmental repercussions\u201d of what happened for weeks to come, which she said include brain fog and feeling depressed.\u201cAs I was eating one of the croissants that was on the tray, I had a really bad feeling,\u201d the 25-year-old from Alberta, Canada, said, according to Kennedy News and Media. \u201cIt tasted so good and I have never tasted such a good gluten-free croissant before. \u201cI then questioned why they would have such a good gluten-free brand on a flight and this is when I questioned whether it was actually gluten-free to a flight attendant.\u201dAccording to Chapdelaine, the flight attendant \u201cwent pale\u201d before going to check whether the pastry was gluten-free. \u201cShe came back and told me it wasn\u2019t meant to be on my plate and it wasn\u2019t gluten-free,\u201d Chapdelaine said, adding: \u201cImmediately I went into shock and started to panic. I am very highly sensitive and my coeliac disease will react to a trace amount or cross contamination.\u201cTo be told I had eaten half a non gluten-free croissant, which is quite a large amount and bigger than what I have reacted to in the past, was really scary for me. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to react.\u201dThe traveller also noted that she wasn\u2019t \u201cupset\u201d because she\u2019d broken her gluten-free diet, but rather because she \u201cknew there were going to be a lot of symptoms I would now have to deal with probably for the next couple of weeks or so\u201d.\u201cIt was a moment of panic. I went to the bathroom and made myself physically sick and was in there for about an hour throwing up, which was horrible,\u201d she said of the actions she took after she\u2019d consumed the croissant. \u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t do this it would cause my body a lot more damage. I could feel the other symptoms starting straight away as well and it just got worse from there.\u201dAccording to the 25 year old, she still began to experience symptoms. \u201cI started getting really bad stomach cramping, I got diarrhoea, I felt nauseous and my skin started itching - when I eat gluten I break out in hives or a rash,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe initial symptoms for me are the stomach issues but after that the rash and hives follow.\u201cThen I have to deal with the mental effects like brain fog or I get depressed for the next couple of weeks.\u201dFollowing her body\u2019s reaction to the croissant, Chapdelaine shared a clip on TikTok to show how serious the effects of eating gluten can be for someone with coeliac disease.Chapdelaine said she had not eaten gluten for almost nine years since she was diagnosed with coeliac disease, but that this was not the first time she has had problems on a flight.\u201cFor me this isn\u2019t the first time I have been exposed to gluten on a plane,\u201d she said. \u201cFortunately, last time I realised before I ate it but had I not, I would have eaten it and the same thing would have happened. It\u2019s not a one-time thing and also on half of the flights I have taken - I travel all the time - gluten-free meals are forgotten.\u201dChapdelaine said, from her experiences, many people are also \u201cquick to question why people with coeliac disease don\u2019t bring their own food on a flight\u201d.In response, she explained: \u201cFirstly, this isn\u2019t always possible as when you\u2019re travelling and in a hotel room you don\u2019t have access to a kitchen to do so. Also, a lot of border security doesn\u2019t allow you to bring food items over the border. A lot of the time you can\u2019t bring meat, dairy or seeds or nuts, which eliminates a lot of products and makes it very difficult for me to bring on my own food onto the plane.\u201dThe Canadian also said airlines need to take allergies and intolerances on flights more seriously, and believes if she had a nut allergy the situation would have been different.\u201cI do feel like coeliac disease is not taken as seriously [as nut allergies] at times,\u201d she said, adding that she believes \u201cpeople with food allergies or sensitivities deserve to exist safely and be taken seriously in their medical condition and that\u2019s not always the case\u201d.\u201cI just hope the airlines specifically take allergies or medical conditions seriously when it comes to serving people food on planes because it can have lasting effects for lots of people,\u201d she continued.As for the response from the airline, Chapdelaine said the Emirates flight attendants were sympathetic towards her, but after filing a formal complaint she has yet to hear from the airline.RecommendedWhy does flight cancellation misery always hit BA at Heathrow and easyJet at Gatwick?Actor Marlon Wayans removed from flight over luggage disputeFlight attendant makes bomb threat to prevent her ex-boyfriend from flying to MiamiAn Emirates spokesperson said: \u201cWe are disappointed to hear Ms Chapdelaine\u2019s complaint.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeFashion lovers can now live out their Devil Wears Prada dream (or \u201cnightmare\u201d), as Vogue is hiring an assistant to none other than Anna Wintour.This week, Vogue publisher Cond\u00e9 Nast posted a job listing for Assistant to the Editor in Chief of American Vogue and Global Chief Content Officer in New York City. Much like Anna Hathaway\u2019s character Andy Sachs in the 2006 film The Devil Wears Prada, Vogue is looking for a candidate to assist with coordinating meetings, managing events and engagements, and overseeing the overall flow of communication and information that comes in and out of Anna Wintour\u2019s office.The ideal candidate is extremely organised, deadline-oriented, and able to multitask in a fast-paced environment. Perhaps knowing the difference between turquoise, lapis, and cerulean wouldn\u2019t hurt, or where to pick up an advanced copy of the seventh Harry Potter book.Minimum requirements include a college education, one to two years of work experience in administrative support, and strong writing skills. The salary range is $60,000 to $80,000.\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity for an ambitious, business-savvy professional who is passionate about culture, fashion, digital media, and content,\u201d the listing reads.Recommended\u2018Worst one ever\u2019: \u2018Art world family\u2019 sparks backlash with personal assistant job adAnne Hathaway explains why The Devil Wears Prada wouldn\u2019t work todayAnne Hathaway responds to her \u2018accidental\u2019 Devil Wears Prada outfit at NYFW: \u2018It was kind of nuts\u2019Unsurprisingly, the new job listing sparked many comparisons to the beloved movie The Devil Wears Prada, in which Meryl Streep stars as Miranda Priestly \u2013 an intimidating magazine editor largely inspired by Anna Wintour. The 2006 film was adapted from a book of the same name by Wintour\u2019s own former assistant, Lauren Weisberger.Since it was posted, many people have shared their reactions to the job listing by posting memes and iconic moments from the film. \u201cA million girls would kill for this job!!!!\u201d tweeted author Matt Ortile, along with a screenshot of the job posting.\u201cY\u2019all didn\u2019t watch The Devil Wears Prada?\u201d one person asked.\u201cThis sounds like a nightmare actually,\u201d another user said.\u201cDoes it come with the makeover from Stanley Tucci,\u201d someone else joked. Meanwhile, others couldn\u2019t help but point out the annual job salary, which ranged from $60,000 to $80,000 per year. Some people believed it was too low of a pay day, considering some of the tasks Anne Hathaway\u2019s character had to do for her boss throughout the film, while others felt it was an unsustainable salary for living in New York City \u2013 where monthly rent has soared to record-high numbers.\u201cSalary is a f***ing travesty for vogue they should be ashamed,\u201d claimed one user. \u201cu can\u2019t afford to live in nyc based off of this salary alone\u201d.\u201cIf Andrea Sachs was actually paid the $80k (and in 2006, no less), I\u2019d understand her sticking with Miranda for so long,\u201d said someone else.Another person wrote: \u201cThe salary range on this is *interesting* but speaks to who gets to occupy space in fashion \u2013 oftentimes a demo [demographic] who do not need to work for a living.

Lauren Weisberger, one of Wintour\u2019s two assistants from 1999 to 2000, wrote the novel The Devil Wears Prada in 2003 based on her experience working at Vogue. However, it seems that the fashion giant has no recollection of the former personal assistant who wrote the famed novel.In Amy Odell\u2019s 2022 book, Anna: The Biography, she claims that Wintour didn\u2019t know which of her assistants could have written the 2003 fiction novel. \u201cOn May 21, 2002, Women\u2019s Wear Daily reported that The Devil Wears Prada had sold to Doubleday for a reported $250,000.

The image showed Fox\u2019s eldest son Noah wearing a pink long-sleeved T-shirt and tie-dye shorts, while Bodhi and Journey were dressed in dark T-shirts and trousers.Starbuck tweeted the paparazzi photo on 8 June, alongside claims that the Transformers star \u201cforced\u201d her sons \u201cto wear girls clothes\u201d in an act of \u201cpure child abuse\u201d.

The photo agency maintained that the image was not within \u201cfair use\u201d, in which third parties are allowed to use copyrighted works without permission in certain limited circumstances.Backgrid also argued that Starbuck cannot claim his use of the photo was for political purposes.

It would be very, very shocking, and I think a little frightening, if that were to be released to the public.

The foundation also argued that the public should be allowed to see Prince Harry\u2019s immigration records to see if he may have provided untruthful answers.For the government, US Assistant Attorney John Bardo argued that sufficient coverage from mainstream US media was required for a request to be expedited.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSummer is in full swing and large swathes of the UK are experiencing very warm temperatures. Saturday (10 June) saw the country record the hottest day of the year so far after the mercury reached 32C in Chertsey, Surrey.As Britons search for ways to keep cool at home, one trick may have been hiding in plain sight this whole time \u2013 if you have sash windows.Sash windows are a common feature of Victorian-era homes and involve a window that can be slid open vertically to create openings at the bottom or the top.However, some people have recently discovered that sash windows can be opened in such a way that it creates openings at the bottom and the top at the same time.The tip was recently revealed by journalist Jess McCabe, who tweeted recently: \u201cAnnual hot weather reminder that if you\u2019ve got sash windows and open them equally at top and bottom, you can enjoy Victorian \u2018air conditioning\u2019 that ventilates and removes heat.\u201dRecommendedThirty, flirty and declining: How 30 became a terrifying milestone for an anxious generationWoman who went from size 18 to size six shares surprising things \u2018no one tells you\u2019 about weight lossWoman applauded for kicking bridesmaid out of wedding after disagreement over dress colourShe added in a separate tweet that she had lived with sash windows for four years and \u201csuffered every summer until we found this out\u201d.According to the University of Cambridge\u2019s Department of Engineering, the act of opening the top and the bottom of a sash window allows for better ventilation as lighter, warmer air escapes through the top, while denser, cooler air enters the building from the bottom.A number of people thanked McCabe for the revelation, as many did not realise it was possible to use sash windows in this way.\u201cThis is life-changing, thank you,\u201d one person said.\u201cI did not know this. Have just opened the bottom pane. Thank you!\u201d another added.Others pointed out that they are unable to take full advantage of their sash windows since they are renting a home in which the top window has been painted or nailed shut.Another summer hack involving windows is to aim a fan so that it faces the outside through the open window. While this sounds counterintuitive, the trick has been hailed as \u201cthe best, low-cost, highly effective technique to keep a home cool\u201d by New Zealand eco design adviser Nelson Lebo.RecommendedHow to tell if you have Covid or heatstrokeWhy do heatwaves in the UK feel hotter than abroad?Pointing a fan to the outdoors through an open window as soon as the temperature outside drops lower than the temperature inside can create cross ventilation.

In many ways, traditional news organisations were forced to join TikTok to avoid being left behind, reach new and younger audiences and ensure they are continuing to find creative ways to pivot in a constantly evolving digital space.\u201cGiven the popularity and high engagement level, it\u2019s not surprising that TikTok has become an important news platform for younger audiences, and it makes sense that news organisations are using it,\u201d said Mark Brill, a senior lecturer in Future Media at Birmingham City University. \u201cThis, however, is a continuation of an existing trend. For well over a decade social media such as Facebook has been the primary news source for under 25s.\u201dAnna Lee, founder at the Fr. App, added: \u201cWe can see that Gen Z individuals are turning to TikTok for any and all searches. While the funniest sound bites and newest dance trends will always have a home on TikTok, you can also equally expect to find videos explaining an arbitrary housing act.\u201dHow is it shared?There are various types of videos that can be shared on TikTok. Alongside the short bite-sized videos sharing the latest news, you can share trending sounds, things creators have posted, or videos with friends, family, and your larger community within TikTok or through other social media platforms.Videos can also be shared directly to other users, as long as the user has allowed for it.How do algorithms work?The TikTok algorithm is a recommendation system that determines which videos will appear on your (unique and highly personalised) For You page, which is also known as the homepage.Brill, who has 25 years of experience applying emerging technologies to engage audiences, said: \u201cMuch of the success of TikTok is the way that their algorithm decides which videos to show their users. TikTok\u2019s system is based entirely on their interests and previous viewing.\u201cThis \u2018more of what you like\u2019 approach means that users spend more time each month in TikTok than any other platform. In the UK it adds up to over 27 hours per user per month and 23 hours globally. It shows how the platform\u2019s algorithm can be highly addictive.\u201dIs it OK that TikTok is how young people learn about what\u2019s happening in the world?Some experts believe it is important for young people to be taught digital literacy at an increasingly earlier age \u2013 especially with the prevalence of fake news and artificial intelligence and its ability to forge fake articles and pictures.\u201cUsers of TikTok and all other social media apps must understand how to evaluate every piece of information they come across,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAll parents worry about their child viewing harmful content on the internet. However, most leading internet providers provide extensive parental controls, including blocking and filtering unsuitable content.\u201dShould they be encouraged to look elsewhere?For Brill, there are both benefits and challenges from using social media as a news source. He also cites the recent Reuters Institute report, which noted that TikTok users tend to look for good-news stories, avoiding the \u2018doom scrolling\u2019 found in web-based internet sites, which can have a negative impact on mental health.\u201cThe big question with social media sources, however, is that of veracity. A lack of fact checking and or acknowledgment of authoritative sources makes it difficult to identify fake stories and information. The short-form video format does not bring an in-depth analysis, where opinions are often presented as fact,\u201d he said.\u201cPerhaps the biggest challenge for TikTok users is with the algorithm itself. By giving more of what they like, it leads to confirmation bias that reinforces existing perceptions.\u201dWhile child and behavioural expert Amanda Jenner, would encourage parents to tell their children to look elsewhere.\u201cI am not a believer in directing children to learn through TikTok at all. Children can easily become addicted to social media and [it] can quickly escalate and [they could] be looking at other things they shouldn\u2019t be watching.RecommendedHow to take care of pets in the heatStruggling with menopause symptoms in the heat? An expert shares tipsMen and women with migraine both have increased risk of stroke \u2013 study\u201cI genuinely do feel parents need to be worried. I would encourage parents to set an age where it\u2019s acceptable to have TikTok (over the age of 13 preferably) and have a parental control app so you can monitor and control what both they are seeing and the amount of time they spend on [it].

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAhead of Father\u2019s Day, Ryan Reynolds has brought back his cocktail recipe for \u201cThe Vasectomy,\u201d this time with help from Jessie James Decker.For the past two years, Reynolds, 46, who shares four children with wife Blake Lively, has featured his Aviation Gin in the Father\u2019s Day cocktail, which is made using gin, tonic, lemon juice, and cranberry juice.This year, Reynolds teamed up with Decker, 35, who shares three children with husband Eric Decker, for the \u201cDecker Edition\u201d of the drink, which sees the singer creating the cocktail for her partner while joking that the beverage gets its name from the procedure her husband has \u201crefused to get\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s Father\u2019s Day and that means it\u2019s time for another vasectomy\u2026 something my husband has refused to get. So, today I\u2019m taking matters into my own hands,\u201d Decker began the Aviation Gin ad.After filling a tall glass to the brim with ice, Decker noted that it is \u201cprobably more ice than you need to soothe your tender areas after what I\u2019m told is a pretty quick and painless procedure\u201d.RecommendedRyan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney confirm Wrexham USA tour to conclude in star\u2019s hometownBlake Lively publicly gushes over husband Ryan Reynolds\u2019 \u2018spicy\u2019 bicep photoRyan Reynolds tells Wrexham player to \u2018put a shirt on\u2019 around wife Blake Lively\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like giving birth,\u201d she added.Decker then fills the glass with an ounce of cranberry juice, which she described as \u201csweet like an outpatient gesture of love,\u201d before adding the Deadpool star\u2019s gin, lemon, and Lively\u2019s tonic brand Betty Buzz. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s at least one husband out there looking out for his better half,\u201d Decker joked of the brand placement for Reynolds\u2019 wife.Once she\u2019d finished making the cocktail, Decker tried a sip, declaring it \u201cso good and so easy\u201d before handing it off to her husband.Reynolds then makes an appearance in the commercial, with the actor informing Decker: \u201cYou know those don\u2019t actually work, right? Like, at all,\u201d before walking off with the bottle of gin.The latest iteration of the ad concludes with Decker quietly assuring her husband that the drink does work. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, they work,\u201d she told the former NFL player.The choice to star Decker in the ad appears to be a reference to her admission that her husband \u201crefuses\u201d to get the surgical procedure, which works as a form of permanent birth control by stopping sperm from leaving the body. The country music singer revealed that the football player \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d make an appointment for the procedure, despite her repeated requests, while speaking to US Weekly in January.\u201cI keep asking him: \u2018Go make that appointment\u2019 and he won\u2019t. He just won\u2019t do it,\u201d Decker said. \u201cHe says it takes, like, his manhood away from him. So he\u2019s just gonna leave it, I guess.\u201dAt the time, the \u201cI Still Love You\u201d singer said the couple, who share daughter Vivianne, eight, and sons Eric, seven, and Forrest, four, probably would not have more children. \u201cI feel like as of right now, it\u2019s probably a no,\u201d she told the outlet.Reynolds\u2019 unique Father\u2019s Day ad has become a tradition, with the actor first unveiling the recipe for The Vasectomy cocktail in 2021. At the time, he\u2019d amusingly claimed in a how-to video that the drink was \u201cso bubbly, just like I feel every day I wake up after a long, full night\u2019s sleep\u201d.After taking a sip, he\u2019d joked it was \u201cas refreshing as fatherhood\u201d.Reynolds and Lively, who share daughters James, eight, Inez, six, and Betty, three, welcomed their fourth child earlier this year. Although he often jokes about the difficulties of raising his young children, the actor told ET Canada in April that he and Lively wouldn\u2019t have expanded their family again if they \u201cdidn\u2019t love it\u201d.\u201cYou know, two to three was a huge jump\u2026 three to four less so,\u201d the actor told the outlet. \u201cI cannot speak for my wife, but it\u2019s just from what I\u2019ve observed. But, we love it. You know, we would be idiots to do this again if we didn\u2019t love it.\u201dIn 2022, the father of four also teamed up with another famous father, Nick Cannon, who has 12 children of his own, for a video about the cocktail.On social media, where Reynolds has shared the clip along with the caption: \u201cThe @aviationgin Vasectomy cocktail: Quick, painless, and delicious.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA judge in DC federal court has asked the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to decide within a week how it will handle a Freedom of Information request from the conservative Heritage Foundation for the immigration records of the Duke of Sussex.DHS has so far not responded to the request, prompting legal action from the foundation, in which they pointed to Prince Harry\u2019s previous admissions of drug use, such as in his memoir Spare. The department argued that an injunction to force DHS to expedite the request shouldn\u2019t go ahead as the foundation hasn\u2019t shown how they will suffer irreparable harm if the information isn\u2019t shared.Representing the government, Assistant US Attorney John Bardo argued on Tuesday that it wouldn\u2019t make a difference when the request was handled, even if the response came a year from now.The Heritage Foundation said the interest in Prince Harry\u2019s immigration status would decrease over time. RecommendedPrince Harry visa case: Why is a US think-tank seeking the release of the Duke of Sussex\u2019s application form?Large parts of the hearing centred on the amount of media attention on Prince Harry and his supposed drug use which some legal experts say would have barred him from entering the US.The Heritage Foundation has suggested that the federal government may have been engaging in favouritism and may have turned a blind eye to actions which may have caused the authorities to reject the visa application. The foundation also argued that the public should be allowed to see Prince Harry\u2019s immigration records to see if he may have provided untruthful answers. Mr Bardo argued that sufficient coverage from mainstream US media was required for a request to be expedited. He mentioned outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and the TV networks.Heritage lawyer Samuel Dewey meanwhile argued in front of Judge Carl Nichols that DHS regulations simply say \u201cmedia\u201d without specifying where the outlets are based.RecommendedHarry tells court of \u2018paranoia\u2019 as he gives evidence in High Court hacking claimPrince Harry court \u2013 live: Duke hits out at Piers Morgan \u2018intimidation\u2019 and James Hewitt rumoursHarry, the people\u2019s prince, takes on the tabloid empireMr Dewey told The Independent that \u201cyou can't define mainstream. That's almost absurd in this context. So as a policy matter, that is a very alarming statement for the press and for transparency for the administration\u201d. Nile Gardiner, the director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the foundation, added: \u201cI do find it astonishing that the British press is referenced as obscure.\u201d\u201cThese are big publications with a wide global reach including millions of Americans who read these newspapers and I find it absolutely astonishing this description today [that there\u2019s] some media that actually count and matter and others that do not. That is an extraordinary statement to make and absolutely unacceptable,\u201d he added. Mr Dewey argued in court that today\u2019s media is global, noting that The Daily Mail had 100 million page views in the US in the month of April.At the Tuesday hearing, Judge Nichols gave DHS a deadline of Tuesday next week \u2013 13 June \u2013 to outline via email if it will expedite the request or provide a response. Three agencies within DHS, including USCIS and US Customs and Border Protection, have rejected the FOIA request, but DHS HQ has so far not responded, with Mr Bardo saying during the hearing that no search for the files has been conducted at DHS HQ. DHS said in legal filings that the US Customs and Border Protection denied the requests because Prince Harry hasn\u2019t consented to the release of the files, with Mr Bardo saying in court that an individual\u2019s visa is \u201cconfidential\u201d. Speaking to reporters outside the DC federal courthouse, Mr Dewey said that Prince Harry had foregone his right to privacy after his series of highly publicised interviews and Netflix documentary series.Mr Dewey argued in court that the case is part of a larger probe into the conduct of the federal government, specifically into DHS supposedly not following the law in other areas of its responsibilities, such as not protecting the US border with Mexico. \u201cWhat are we asking for here?\u201d Mr Dewey told reporters outside the courthouse. \u201cWe are only asking for the records that are related to this question that has been raised about the drug use and admission ... he's talked about it, he's written about it extensively, he has waived any privacy interest he has in his drug use, he has bragged about it in Spare and sold that.\u201d\u201cWe are calling for accountability, transparency and openness from the Biden presidency,\u201d Dr Gardner said. \u201cWe believe there is a tremendous public interest in the release of these records in order to establish that US immigration law is fair, [that] it applies equally to everyone.\u201d \u201cIt is our view, definitely, that the public needs to see these ... documents and [what] exactly what Prince Harry put down on his application, especially in relation to his widespread drug use admitted to in Spare,\u201d he added. Dr Gardner said the foundation wants \u201cto establish whether or not any favours were granted to Prince Harry, whether there was a preferential treatment given to Prince Harry in any way\u201d. The director of the Oversight Project at The Heritage Foundation, Mike Howell, told reporters after the hearing that \u201cthe everyday American is absolutely sick and tired of globalist elites lecturing us, looking down at us, dominating our cultural institutions, and no one proves that point more than Prince Harry\u201d. \u201cThey're also sick and tired of a broken immigration system, one that we see a dual standard at play every single day,\u201d he added. Prince Harry wrote in Spare that cocaine \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything for me\u201d. \u201cMarijuana is different, that actually really did help me,\u201d he added. Also on Tuesday, Prince Harry was giving evidence in his phone hacking trial in London against the publisher of a UK tabloid.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeRecently, I went away for a joint birthday weekend with 10 friends I\u2019ve known since childhood. All of us had either just turned, or were about to turn 30. Hungover in a Dorset Airbnb, we loaded up the classic time travel romcom 13 Going on 30. What other film could we choose? Together, we laughed at the fantasy depiction of a 30-year-old life: a luxurious Manhattan apartment, a high-flying editorial job at a magazine, a walk-in wardrobe, no student debt in sight. But we also felt unsettled by the fact that the last time we all watched the film together was on its release in 2004. Back then we were all 11 and \u2013 much like the film\u2019s teenage protagonist who magically conjures herself into the future, wishing to be \u201cthirty, flirty and thriving\u201d \u2013 we were eager to skip over the messiness of adolescence and get to adulthood, where we imagined life would really start. But now we were finally there, why did it feel, not like life was over exactly, but that a significant part of it was ending?As I approach 30, it\u2019s been impossible not to notice how this particular \u201cage milestone\u201d still has the capacity to make people lose their minds. Suddenly, everyone around me was talking about babies and mortgages. But mainly in tones that ranged from ironic and nihilistic (\u201cI can\u2019t have a baby, I am a baby\u201d) to pure panic (\u201cI\u2019ll be renting forever\u201d). With a Big Life Stage on the horizon, people made Big Life Decisions \u2013 but ones that also seemed designed to put off \u201cthe trappings of adulthood\u201d a little longer. People in stable jobs suddenly quit them; others sold their belongings and went travelling; at least two people I know moved to Australia. \u201cHow do you feel about turning 30,\u201d everyone asked everyone. \u201cTotally fine,\u201d everyone replied, with a crazed look in their eyes.Research suggests that panicking about an impending age goes far beyond the anecdotal \u2013 according to a 2022 survey for the relationship support charity Relate, 77 per cent of 25- to 39-year-olds and 83 per cent of 16- to 24-year-olds feel pressure to reach traditional life milestones. The charity also revealed \u201cmilestone anxiety\u201d is a topic that is increasingly coming up in therapy sessions. The big question is why? Why do certain age milestones hold such weight, such emotional power? What is it about turning 30 in particular that causes so much angst and anxiety?\u201cWe focus on the loss and not the gain when getting older,\u201d Amy*, who is now 33, tells me. \u201cI think the freak-out part comes from the expectation that after 30 you need to be more settled \u2013 know what job you want to do, be doing that job, live somewhere that feels like your home, have kids or start to have kids if you want them.\u201d This expectation to be settled \u2013 to have \u201csorted things out\u201d \u2013 can make the lead-up to 30 feel like a pressure cooker. \u201cNo one\u2019s hyped for 30 like the 21 milestone,\u201d Amy says. \u201cTwenty-one marks the start of an era and 30 kind of marks the end of one\u201d. Eleanor, who turned 30 in December, echoes this sentiment. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown up with the idea that life ends at 30,\u201d she says. Although she admits everyone knows this is \u201ca total lie\u201d, she says it still contributes to the sense \u201cyou\u2019ve done the good bit and the rest is getting old\u201d.Part of the issue here seems to lie in how much contemporary culture eulogises being in your twenties. Within the creative industries especially, numerous prizes and opportunities are offered for \u201cemerging\u201d practitioners \u2013 which sometimes means under 25, and almost always means under 30. \u201cThirty under 30\u201d lists have become a media staple, feeding a sense that 30 is a cut-off point of sorts, after which achievements matter less, as you \u201cshould\u201d have not only \u201cemerged\u201d but become established. There is a pervasive social narrative that your twenties are for exploration, adventure and fun, but also for figuring things out and setting yourself up in the world. Instability and uncertainty is written off in your twenties \u2013 or even lauded as part and parcel of \u201cbeing young\u201d \u2013 but if you then find yourself at the end of the decade without a stable partner, a \u201cproper\u201d job, and a healthy savings account, a nagging feeling of failure can creep in. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown up with the idea that by 30 we\u2019ll be married with kids and a house,\u201d Eleanor suggests. This \u201cvery traditional, heteronormative version of life\u201d is changing, she stresses, but adds that on a personal level \u201cletting go of those subconscious success markers is quite tough\u201d.RecommendedMoney can\u2019t buy happiness?

By all accounts, she seemed to have made a success of her twenties, and found not just a job, but a career she both enjoyed and excelled in. She\u2019d recently been promoted. Yet, in the run-up to turning 30 last month, she also found herself gripped by self-doubt \u2013 a feeling of \u201cI have failed my life\u201d, she says. She felt drained and chronically stressed. She kept getting sick. Other teachers were quitting around her, and Hannah steadily realised that, like them, she was experiencing an extreme form of burnout \u2013 but her internal narrative that she \u201cwasn\u2019t where she should be\u201d, that she was failing, \u201cmeant that my job was the thing I was clinging on to, even though it wasn\u2019t making me very happy\u201d. Finally, just weeks before her 30th birthday, Hannah quit. \u201cI got to a stage where I was like, \u2018if I live my life like it\u2019s over then it will be\u2019.\u201d\n\nPeople always told me \u2018you don\u2019t need to worry about your age because your twenties are for yourself, and then life begins to track you down after that\u2019 Dan, 30Much has been made of how \u201cthe millennial generation\u201d has been experiencing a \u201cprolonged adolescence\u201d: \u201csettling down\u201d later than previous generations; changing jobs more often; living with parents or in shared housing for longer. Some people might assume that all this anxiety around turning 30 stems from a desire to prolong the adolescent stage even further \u2013 that it comes from a reluctance to accept the realities of adulthood, that \u201cthe millennial generation\u201d is also \u201cthe snowflake generation\u201d. Yet to me, it seems clear that the opposite is true. For today\u2019s twentysomethings, adulthood is held perpetually out of reach, and, actually, we haven\u2019t really been having much fun anyway.Dominant cultural scripts about \u201csuccess markers\u201d bump up against a world in which wages have stagnated, rents and house prices have skyrocketed, and the expansion of university education followed by the introduction of \u00a39,000 tuition fees has left a vast swathe of young people loaded with debts upwards of \u00a350,000. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that three-quarters of graduates will never pay it all back. Meanwhile, the \u201cASHE table\u201d on age group earnings published by the Office of National Statistics reports that the average salary for 22-29 year olds in the UK is \u00a325,178. With average monthly rents outside London soaring to a record high of \u00a31,190 in the first quarter of this year, is it any wonder traditional life milestones are being met later? When you\u2019re just trying to make rent, having children before 35 can feel like the last thing on anyone\u2019s minds (especially as childcare costs also soar and precarious employment becomes more commonplace for under-thirties).This political backdrop is also why I believe \u201c30 anxiety\u201d goes beyond questions of gender. I\u2019ve heard from numerous people \u2013 from twentysomethings to sixtysomethings \u2013 that women freak out about turning 30, and men freak out about turning 40. Certainly, women face a different set of social expectations when it comes to ageing; the sexist, ageist voice of the patriarchy sounding a lot like Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s subconscious. Yet, most of the discussion I\u2019ve seen about this age milestone seems to work from the assumption that it\u2019s all biological, and the issue comes down to the ticking timebomb of women\u2019s body clocks. Speaking to women on either side of the 30 threshold, however, the dominant feeling wasn\u2019t anxiety at the idea of \u201ctime running out\u201d, but frustration that conversations about \u201cfamily planning\u201d are pinned to them and not men their age. Thirty-three-year-old Holly, for example, says she\u2019s \u201cnoticed a change since turning 30 in how frequently older generations feel it\u2019s OK to ask when you\u2019re finally gonna have kids\u201d.Lies, all lies: Jennifer Garner in the 2004 comedy \u201813 Going on 30\u2019  (Shutterstock)Any belief that milestone anxiety only affects women, or only concerns fertility, seems misguided at best, and at worst, a perpetuation of harmful stereotypes about women\u2019s role in society. Certainly, all the conversations I\u2019ve had with men and women alike reveal something much starker about turning 30, and how the age is loaded with deeper, underlying fears \u2013 about how to navigate the contemporary world, what success and failure look like, and how stability, happiness and hope seem so fleeting and fragile.Dan, a senior programme officer for an international scholarships and fellowships programme, turned 30 last autumn. His twenties were a struggle, he tells me. \u201cIt took a long time to build up and get to somewhere I was comfortable with, and there was a lot of unhappiness along the way.\u201d Yet, at the same time, he also felt a degree of freedom. \u201cPeople always told me \u2018you don\u2019t need to worry about your age because your twenties are for yourself, and then life begins to track you down after that\u2019,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo, in my head I\u2019ve always fixated on the idea that there\u2019s no difference between being 24 and 29, because I\u2019m just doing what I want to right now.\u201d At 29, he \u201cgot to a point where [he] was really happy.\u201d But, with the prospect of turning 30 looming, he was dogged by the thought life was about to start \u201ctracking him down\u201d, and kept thinking, \u201cI\u2019m in a good place now and I absolutely do not want to let it go\u201d. On the day of his 30th itself, Dan says he felt \u201ccompletely overwhelmed that all of my chickens were coming home to roost, and everything that I\u2019d spent my twenties looking for in terms of happiness and comfort were up in the air because I\u2019d have to start cashing in the cheques of being 30\u201d. Essentially, he believes it was \u201cthe spectre of responsibility\u201d that caused this emotional whirlwind. To me, though, it also seems to signal how hostile contemporary society can feel for young people today \u2013 how hard-won and temporary happiness seems, while the pressure to conform to social expectations feels bullish.I turn 30 in a month and, at times, the prospect of it has felt like a spotlight has been thrown on every part of my life, illuminating all the scrappy, messy bits; all the things I\u2019d like to change. \u201cI got really envious,\u201d Hannah admits, \u201cand devalued the things I did have, while really overvaluing the things I didn\u2019t have.\u201d Since quitting her job, though, this feeling has started to dissipate. Now, she says the main question she keeps asking herself is: \u201cIf this is my life, what could it look like \u2013 not in terms of what could it [contain], but how could I feel about living it?\u201d To begin to figure this out, though, she\u2019s had to put aside what society constitutes as success. \u201cI find it difficult to disentangle my ageing from the world I\u2019m doing it in,\u201d she adds.RecommendedHow to take care of pets in the heatThat\u2019s brunch: Goan-inspired coconut and cabbage frittersMan \u2018faked his own death to teach family a lesson\u2019In a state of perma-crisis, under successive anti-youth Tory-led governments, this is a difficult task. Yet, on a personal level, perhaps the only answer is to try and see models of \u201csuccessful adulthood\u201d as what they are: a fantasy. Since turning 30, Dan has realised \u201cnothing has changed\u201d. He says he\u2019s even \u201cregressed\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m playing Crash Bandicoot and I bought Pokemon cards off Ebay recently, and I enjoy Star Wars lego, and I\u2019ve just quit my job.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that counts as a mid-life crisis but perhaps it might be!\u201d*Names have been changed"}, {"_id": "6489ffa151ac3318d5fe4f69", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/heatstroke-heat-peta-usa-rspca-b2357376.html", "primaryCategory": "Lifestyle", "subCategories": "test", "title": "How to take care of pets in the heat", "lead": "If the pavement is too hot for your bare feet, it\u2019s too hot for theirs.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeWith temperatures rising, it\u2019s hard to keep ourselves cool \u2013 never mind our four-legged friends. With fur coats on, it can\u2019t be easy being a pet in a heatwave.According to PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), in the USA alone, 70 dogs (and other companion animals) have died from heat-related causes since 2022 \u2013 with many expected to be unreported.\u201cHeat can have a profound effect on our pets. From heatstroke to skin damage \u2013 such as paw pad burns, sunburn, and possible skin cancers with prolonged excessive sun exposure \u2013 our pets have similar risks to us humans,\u201d says veterinary surgeon Lily Richards, advisor to Trusted Housesitters.So, how can we keep them safe and cool?Getting out and aboutRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveYour dog will still need exercise in hot weather, but overheating is a worry.\u201cOverheating is a particular problem for certain breeds of dogs; those that are brachycephalic [short nosed], those that are naturally very active, have a thick coat, and older pets or younger animals. Heatstroke is an unfortunately common medical emergency seen in vet clinics,\u201d says Richards.\u201cAvoid exercising your pets at the hottest parts of the day, aiming for early mornings or late evenings, when the temperatures are more manageable.\u201dKeeping hydrated\u201cEnsuring your pet has constant access to water is essential in hot weather. You could consider offering iced treats \u2013 freezing their usual treats in treat puzzles, for example. Ensuring your pet stays out of the midday sun and in the cool will also help prevent excessive dehydration,\u201d says Richards.Sun protectionYou may not think animals get sunburnt like us.\u201cBut, sunburn is a risk to our pets, those that have less hair cover, or white features \u2013 such as white ear tips or noses \u2013 are particularly at risk,\u201d explains Richards.\u201cWhite cats who are avid sunbathers are commonly seen with skin damage, due to excessive sun exposure without protection. Pet sunblock is a must to help those prone to sunburn, as prolonged exposure can lead to blistering, or even the development of skin cancers. Don\u2019t be tempted to use human sunblock, however, as some contain ingredients that are toxic to pets.\u201dThere are many animal-friendly options on the market instead \u2013 try Petkin sunscreen or Be:Loved sun protection balm.Things to avoid\u201cBe careful to not leave pets alone with cooling mats, as if the mats are damaged and the contents ingested, your pet could become quite unwell,\u201d explains Richards.\u201cAvoid unsupervised paddling pools and bathing, as just with children, these are a great, fun way to keep cool \u2013 but accidents can happen and safety could be a concern,\u201d she says.While the majority of us would never leave a dog in a car on a hot day, or even take them for a long walk in high temperatures, Esme Wheeler from the RSPCA says it\u2019s still a risk to take pets on short walks. \u201cBy taking them to fields and beaches with little or no shade, the truth is, walking dogs in hot weather can be a silent killer,\u201d she says.\u201cThe message remains very simple \u2013 never leave a dog in a hot car because \u2018not long\u2019 is too long, and when it comes to walks, \u2018if in doubt, don\u2019t go out\u2019.\u201dKeeping cool indoors\u201cKeep the house temperature cool by closing curtains and opening windows. The addition of fans or cooling mats will help keep your pet cool in the house, too\u201d Richards says.\u201cFor small furries like rodents, guinea pigs or rabbits, consider supplying frozen water bottles for lying next to, which will help them cool off if they\u2019re feeling the heat.\u201dRecommendedStruggling with menopause symptoms in the heat?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA Belgian man has explained why he faked his own death and turned up to his \u201cfuneral\u201d in a helicopter, to the shock of his loved ones.David Baerten, 45, claimed he carried out the elaborate \u201cprank\u201d to teach members of his family a lesson about the importance of staying in touch with one another.Baerten, who posts on TikTok by the name Ragnar le Fou, told French chat show Touche Pas a Mon Poste (TPMP) that he orchestrated the stunt because he felt \u201cunappreciated\u201d by some of his relatives.A video capturing the moment that the 45-year-old man arrived at his own funeral in a helicopter was posted by a TikTok user by the name of Thomas Faut, who apparently attended the ceremony.Footage shows the mourners watching as the helicopter landed in a field and a door opened. It then cuts to a clip of people surrounding Baerten, with more walking towards him, to hug and greet him, as a film crew recorded the scene.RecommendedThirty, flirty and declining: How 30 became a terrifying milestone for an anxious generationWoman who went from size 18 to size six shares surprising things \u2018no one tells you\u2019 about weight lossVegan family writes letter to neighbours requesting they close their windows when cooking meatAnother video uploaded by Thomas showed an emotional relative crying as he embraced Baerten.The TikTok user wrote in the caption: \u201cYou got us, I swear I was crying and then I had the shock, buddy we love you very much.\u201dThe staged funeral took place last week near Liege after one of Baerten\u2019s daughters reportedly wrote a \u201ctribute\u201d to her father on social media and said: \u201cRest in peace, Daddy. I will never stop thinking about you. Why is life so unfair? Why you? You were going to be a grandfather and you still had your whole life ahead of you. I love you! We love you! We will never forget you.\u201dThe prank did not sit well with viewers and many people criticised Baerten for being \u201ccruel\u201d to his family.Whilst Baerten has not uploaded footage of the funeral himself, he posted a video explaining why he carried out the stunt. According to The Times, Baerten said he was \u201churt\u201d because he \u201cnever gets invited to anything\u201d by his family members.\u201cNobody sees me. We all grew apart. I felt unappreciated. That\u2019s why I wanted to give them a life lesson and show them that you shouldn\u2019t wait until someone is dead to meet up with them,\u201d he said. TikToker David Baerten explained in a follow-up video why he decided to carry out the prank (TikTok/ragnar_le_fou)He added that although \u201conly half\u201d of his family attended his fake funeral, other relatives have since contacted him.\u201cThat proves who really cares about me,\u201d he said. \u201cThose who didn\u2019t come did contact me to meet up.

First make the base. Place the pistachios and desiccated coconut in a frying Pan over a low heat and toast, stirring, for about 7 minutes until the coconut is golden and nutty. Remove from the heat and set aside.2. Place the butter in a saucepan over a low heat and stir constantly until you see it bubble up vigorously with a thick, cappuccino-like foam, and then light brown solids will start to form on the bottom. At this point, take the pan off the heat, stirring for about 30 more seconds, then immediately transfer it to another bowl, making sure to scrape out all the solids from the bottom, as these carry so much flavour. Then, stir through the coconut oil until it has melted in the residual heat.3. Place the speculoos biscuits in a sealed freezer bag and bash with a rolling pin until the mixture resembles fine crumbs. Then, add the coconut and pistachios and bash these again to break down the nuts slightly (you can also use a food processor).

Press this into the base of a 20cm springform cake tin, and use the base of a mug to flatten it down. Transfer to the fridge to chill and harden while you make the cheesecake filling.5. Place the cardamom pods in a dry frying pan over a low heat and toast, stirring, for about 10 minutes until fragrant. Transfer to a pestle and mortar and bash to release the seeds from the shells. Discard the shells (I keep mine and add them to my chai), then grind the seeds into a fine powder. You can also grind the whole pods, including the shells, in a spice grinder.6. In a large bowl, place the double cream, icing sugar, vanilla bean paste and ground cardamom and whisk to fairly stiff peaks.7. In a separate bowl, combine the cream cheese, runny honey and 150g of the mango pur\u00e9e and whisk well to combine. Then, fold through the whipped cream into this cream cheese mixture in three parts, until no streaks remain.8. Remove the base from the fridge and pour half the cheesecake mixture over the top. Then, swirl through half the remaining mango pur\u00e9e and use a knife or skewer to swirl this through the mixture. Then repeat with the remaining cheesecake mixture and mango pur\u00e9e and use an offset spatula to level the top. Place in the fridge for 6\u20138 hours, or ideally overnight, until completely set.9. To serve, run a palette knife or offset spatula around the rim of the cheesecake and then carefully release the springform tin and slide off the metal base.RecommendedCrystelle Pereira: \u2018This is controversial but...

The sap can also lead to blindness if it gets in the eyes.How is it recognised?While giant hogweed typically grows near river banks, canal towpaths, woodland and heathland, experts warn it has spread to gardens, parks and verges in recent years. Plant Tracker \u2013 an Environment Agency-based database of invasive, non-native plants \u2013 reports hundreds of sightings across all four UK nations, as far afield as Inverness, Pembrokeshire, County Londonderry and Kent.It is often mistaken for cow parsley, elderflower, bishop\u2019s lace or hemlock due to its long stems and flat-topped clusters of white leaves.While, like hemlock, its thick, bristly stems can also be pocked with purple blotches, it has fewer ferns and can grow significantly taller than either plant, with flower heads spanning up to two feet wide.How can it be disposed of?Although there is technically no statutory obligation for landowners to rid their properties of the weed, many property owners and local authorities choose to do so due to the dangers posed to the public.It is, however, an offence to allow the weed to spread into the wild \u2013 so it is possible that landowners could be deemed responsible for outbreaks believed to stem from plants growing on their property.Furthermore, landowners who fail to clear it from their land have in the past been handed anti-social behaviour orders.Giant Hogweed can cause severe burns and blisters (Creative Commons)Ideally, always wear gloves, face masks and ensure all skin is covered while dealing with giant hogweed, bearing in mind that anything coming into contact with it \u2013 be that clothing, tools or skin \u2013 will be contaminated and should be washed immediately.Young plants can be pulled up using gloved hands when soil is wet, around May when it has reached a reasonable heigh but before it has produced its flowering spike, according to the Royal Horticultural Society.For larger plants it might be necessary to loosen the roots with a fork first. Larger scale areas should probably be left to professionals to dispose of.\u201cThere is no need to be scared of the plant \u2013 just use common sense \u2013 and take action if you identify it on your property,\u201d a Mersey Rivers Trust spokesperson told The Independent, adding: \u201cKeep children away from the plant until it has died off fully.\u201cThe plant can produce up to 100,000 seeds, and the seed bank can last up to 15 years \u2013 meaning a prolonged period of vigilance for newly emerged seedlings and a prolonged period of treatment.\u201dWhat do I do if I touch giant hogweed?RecommendedBaseball-sized hail hammers Texas as state braces for severe heatwave Four dead as India and Pakistan brace for Cyclone BiparjoyFraming disasters as natural masks societal inequalities, charity saysThe NHS advises covering the area and washing it with soap and water.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeHeatwaves can be uncomfortable at the best of times, but what if you\u2019re already having hot flushes?Dr Naomi Potter, founder of Menopause Care and co-author of bestselling book, Menopausing, with Davina McCall, points out that eight in 10 people who go through menopause experience symptoms like hot flushes \u2013 a sudden surge of heat, often accompanied by redness and sweating.Night sweats and trouble sleeping are also common during perimenopause and menopause \u2013 not the sort of things you want to be dealing with when a heatwave hits.\u201cThe increasing temperatures can make hot flushes and night sweats worse, and make it harder to cool down when you do experience them,\u201d says Potter, explaining that the lack of oestrogen associated with menopause affects the part of the brain that helps regulate body temperature.\u201cIf you\u2019re already hot and sweaty, then having a night sweat or hot flush can just make everything worse and uncomfortable.\u201dRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveHere\u2019s her advice for getting through the summer heatwaves\u2026Travelling\u201cPublic transport can be awful at the best of times in the heat, especially when travelling on tubes, trains and buses where you\u2019re cramped in, so if you experience a hot flush while travelling, it can be extremely unpleasant,\u201d Potter says. \u201cTry carrying water and a small fan, to give some comfort in these moments, if just for a short relief.\u201dIf you can, invest in a water bottle designed to keep liquids cold, so you\u2019ll always have something cool to sip when you need to.Be drink savvySpeaking of drinks, Potter also suggests trying to limit alcohol, coffee and sugary beverages, especially if menopause symptoms are proving troublesome. Iced tea and water are ideal options.\u201cDuring the summer, you\u2019re more likely to be dehydrated, and alcohol, coffee and fizzy drinks worsen dehydration,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo it\u2019s worth bearing that in mind and staying hydrated with water.\u201dSleep\u00a0Menopause might already be impacting your mood and energy levels, so sleepless nights can be a double whammy. \u201cIn the case of night sweats, you\u2019ll often experience broken and interrupted sleep, which has a knock-on effect and impact on lifestyle and work the next day,\u201d says Potter.\u201cCreate a cool sleeping environment by wearing light breathable bed clothes and have a spare by the bed in case you wake up sweaty, so you can change without having to properly wake up to find new clothes,\u201d she suggests. Plus, a well-positioned bedroom fan will be your summer best friend.Dress lightIt goes without saying that clothing also affects temperature \u2013 so if hot flushes are bothering you, tweaking your wardrobe could certainly help. Potter suggests dressing in \u201clightweight, breathable fabrics\u201d such as cotton or linen. Plus, a light pair of cycling shorts/long knickers under skirts and dresses can help massively with sweating and discomfort at this time of year.Get the right supportHeatwave or no heatwave, menopause doesn\u2019t have to mean suffering in silence and just soldiering on if symptoms are impacting you.\u201cIf somebody is having symptoms, then it is definitely worth seeing their GP because there\u2019s lots that can be done,\u201d says Potter. \u201cAnd if you have a menopause-friendly workplace, it is definitely worth talking to [managers] because with recently headlines, many workplaces are much more supportive of the menopause.\u201cI think it\u2019s vital that conversations like this continue,\u201d Potter adds. \u201cWithout speaking about experiences, then there is no way for people to realise that this is a normal life event, and there is help if it is required.\u201dStoring HRT in the heatFinally, if you are taking hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), make sure it\u2019s being stored correctly when temperatures soar.RecommendedMen and women with migraine both have increased risk of stroke \u2013 studyLess than half of children \u2018have received a meaningful financial education\u2019Harry Potter star Miriam Margolyes makes British Vogue cover debut aged 82\u201cMost HRT should be stored at room temperature.

Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the report suggested that tipping practices have rapidly changed, as customers are being prompted to leave tips in self-checkout lines at airports, grocery stores, stadiums, and cafes.While companies and organisations claimed that tipping is completely optional and tips at self-checkout stations are split between staff members, some customers said that being prompted to tip in a self-checkout situation feels like \u201cemotional blackmail\u201d \u2013 a means of guilt-tripping customers into tipping even when they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t.In the US, it\u2019s customary to leave between 15 and 20 per cent of the total bill before tax is included. Some people say that 18 per cent is the bare minimum, while others argue that a 20 per cent tip is standard \u2013 for restaurants, fast-casual establishments, food delivery drivers, and bartenders.Last year, a woman on TikTok went viral after claiming that she was asked to tip an airport worker for checking her bag.

Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the report suggested that tipping practices have rapidly changed, as customers are being prompted to leave tips in self-checkout lines at airports, grocery stores, stadiums, and cafes.While companies and organisations claimed that tipping is completely optional and tips at self-checkout stations are split between staff members, some customers said that being prompted to tip in a self-checkout situation feels like \u201cemotional blackmail\u201d \u2013 a means of guilt-tripping customers into tipping even when they ordinarily wouldn\u2019t.In the US, it\u2019s customary to leave between 15 and 20 per cent of the total bill before tax is included. Some people say that 18 per cent is the bare minimum, while others argue that a 20 per cent tip is standard \u2013 for restaurants, fast-casual establishments, food delivery drivers, and bartenders.Last year, a woman on TikTok went viral after claiming that she was asked to tip an airport worker for checking her bag. In the video, TikTok user Addysen Drake said: \u201cTell me why when I get to the airport, after paying $400 for a flight, and I\u2019m going to pay for my $35 checked bag, the guy says to me: \u2018OK, you have to pay in credit card, but you can tip in cash.\u2019\u201dRecommendedAirbnb customer shares anger after being charged for dog hair in pet-friendly homeJamie Foxx\u2019s rep addresses conspiracy Covid vaccine left actor \u2018paralyzed and blind\u2019Tom Holland drops hint about how his romance with Zendaya beganDrake claimed that when she took out her credit card, the worker handed her an iPad screen and asked her, \u201cWhat would you like to leave for a tip?\u201d\u201cWhat am I tipping that man for?

I try to get balance and moderation, which is a constant battle, whether I am looking at how I eat, drink, work, or exercise. In my early 20s, it was so manic and I tried to work all the hours God sent, so the theme of my mid-20s has been trying to find moderation,\u201d she explains.That moderation has become pertinent to her drinking habits.\u201cI am a mindful drinker. I have been drinking since I was 18, but over the past three years, I have really tried to be more mindful.\u201dShe\u2019s not the only one.

I go every day of every year but it can be a really long week,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople go racing for so many different reasons, but you want to be on flying form.

[Cooking] is literally my full-time job, it\u2019s no longer a side hobby that I rush to do after I finish a long day of work.\u201cIt means I\u2019ve got more time to really put into my job, I\u2019m free to go on trips to Italy to look at Parmesan,\u201d (an excursion she\u2019s embarking on soon) \u201cand obviously doing my book took up so much time.\u201dPereira attending the UK premiere of \u2018The Menu\u2019 (Alamy/PA)Flavour Kitchen, her debut cookbook, is a colourful ode to Pereira\u2019s Portuguese-Goan heritage (her parents met in Mumbai before moving to the UK).Split into two halves, the savoury section features brunch bites, curries, pasta, noodles, salads and more, all bursting with international flavours, such as Goan chilli chicken fry, kimcheese toasty, and honey and chipotle baked camembert.The sweet half is all about cakes, cookies, pies and other treats with a twist. Bake Off fans will remember the pistachio, orange and cardamom carrot cake Pereira created for her final Signature Challenge.\u201cGoa is in the south of India, and it was colonised by the Portuguese,\u201d Pereira says, which is why Goan food is so different to the rest of Indian cuisine.Vindaloo curry, for example, has its roots in Europe: \u201cThe Portuguese had this dish called carne de vinha d\u2019alhos, a pork and wine dish. The Goans took that and swapped Portuguese wine with Goan vinegar and that became vindaloo.\u201dMany of the savoury recipes in Flavour Kitchen feature a liberal splash of the tangy liquid.\u201cOur food is very vinegar-based, which sounds a bit off-putting but it just works because it\u2019s all balanced really well,\u201d Pereira says.\u201cIf something\u2019s got lots of vinegar, then it\u2019s offset with something sweet like jaggery, which is an unrefined sugar, or coconut, because coconuts are in abundance in Goa.\u201dGiven the choice, the adventurous cook would much rather tuck into fiery fish curry, egg fried rice with Korean gochujang chilli paste or noodles with \u201cabout 10 cloves of garlic\u201d than a plate of pretentious haute cuisine.\u201cI will be honest, this is really controversial\u2026\u201d she begins, pausing before admitting: \u201cI\u2019m not that big on French food.\u201dConceding that Parisian pastries are unbeatable, she continues: \u201cI\u2019m just more into pan-Asian and Mediterranean food \u2013 I just think the flavours are a bit more vibrant.\u201cLike you think about South Korea, you think about gochujang; in Greece you think about fresh mint, coriander, lemon, halloumi; Mexico, you\u2019ve got chipotle; go to the Middle East, you\u2019ve got harissa, ras el hanout [spice mix], all these flavours.\u201dThe cook credits her mum and dad\u2019s cooking for helping her develop a taste for the exotic, and her late grandad \u2013 to whom she dedicates the book \u2013 with overseeing her success.\u201cHe sadly he passed away before any of this took off, but I genuinely believe in life after death \u2013 I genuinely believe he\u2019s been a big part in guiding me through all of this.\u201cI think he just knew l was going to end up in food. Funnily enough he used to call me MasterChef \u2013 we used to watch a lot of cooking shows together.\u201dHaving amassed 190,000 Instagram followers and cooked live on Good Morning America, The Today Show and ITV\u2019s Lorraine, Pereira is well on her way to celebrity chef status.There have been many a pinch-me moment during her first year as a fully-fledged foodie, none more surreal than when she met King Charles (at that point still a Prince) at a Queen\u2019s Jubilee lunch event last summer.\u201c[Charles and Camilla] turned up and I thought, \u2018I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t come over to speak to us,\u201d Pereira recalls.\u201cAll of a sudden he\u2019s walked over and said, \u2018Oh, do you mind if I sit there? Because there was a seat next to me.\u201dWhat did the pair talk about? \u201cI think I was just word-vomiting! I said \u2018Do you like baked goods?\u2019 and \u2018Do you bake?\u2019\u201cThe general consensus was he doesn\u2019t bake, but he does like to eat. He likes cakes, he likes Italian cuisine. And then I was just talking to him about my style of baking and stuff. We had a merry old chat!\u201dAs well as finding herself starstruck by royals, Pereira has had to get used to being recognised by fans:\u00a0\u201cIt literally happened the day after the first episode, which was wild.\u201cI was going to work, I was on the train platform \u2013 I had a mask on my face, which is even funnier.

I brought my folding camping chair and my headphones to listen to my show,\u201d they explained in the viral post.\u201cAbout 40 minutes before the school would let us inside, a pregnant woman got next to me since somebody let her in line (I assume her partner),\u201d they said. \u201cShe asked me within five minutes (politely admittedly) if she could have my chair as she was going to have trouble standing the whole time.\u201dThe stranger explained to the pregnant woman that they actually need the chair \u201cmore\u201d because they have problems standing due to their \u201cbad feet and knees\u201d. Two minutes later, the pregnant woman then asked for a second time if she could use the chair, and their answer was the same.\u201cShe, however, got a little mad at me and said that she was going to be struggling the whole time and asked her partner to tell me,\u201d the Reddit user said.

I brought my folding camping chair and my headphones to listen to my show,\u201d they explained in the viral post.\u201cAbout 40 minutes before the school would let us inside, a pregnant woman got next to me since somebody let her in line (I assume her partner),\u201d they said. \u201cShe asked me within five minutes (politely admittedly) if she could have my chair as she was going to have trouble standing the whole time.\u201dThe stranger explained to the pregnant woman that they actually need the chair \u201cmore\u201d because they have problems standing due to their \u201cbad feet and knees\u201d. Two minutes later, the pregnant woman then asked for a second time if she could use the chair, and their answer was the same.\u201cShe, however, got a little mad at me and said that she was going to be struggling the whole time and asked her partner to tell me,\u201d the Reddit user said.

During the interview, Morgan quizzed Brooke about her previous aspirations to be a lawyer before she joined the sex work industry.\u201cI\u2019m just curious about you being someone who embarks on a law career, who\u2019s obviously very bright, went to university, packed it in just for money, to be effectively an online stripper. I mean, that\u2019s what you do, right?\u201d Morgan asked Brooke.The OnlyFans model cheekily replied: \u201cI could be a good lawyer, yes, but also am I good at doing other things on video and camera? Yes.\u201dThe 58-year-old TV personality then asked Brooke how she thinks her future children would feel about her career as a sex worker. \u201cAre you going to be proud that you have your little ones and they look at you and go:\u2018Didn\u2019t you want to be a lawyer?\u2019 and you go: \u2018Yeah, but look at all my stuff!\u2019\u201dRecommendedPiers Morgan defends \u2018good friend\u2019 Holly Willoughby after \u2018patronising\u2019 Phillip Schofield speechOnlyFans model with 7,000 online boyfriends reveals why she doesn\u2019t date in real lifePlus-size travel blogger shares how she secures two seats on \u2018almost every\u2019 flightBrooke responded: \u201cThey can cry in a Ferrari,\u201d leaving Morgan seemingly speechless.A clip of Brooke\u2019s interview with Morgan was reposted to Twitter by viral news account Daily Loud, where it instantly received 35 million views.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeAn OnlyFans creator is being praised for her \u201clegendary\u201d response to Piers Morgan after he expressed concern over what her future children will think about her career.Elle Brooke, 25, recently appeared on Piers Morgan\u2019s TalkTV show Piers Morgan Uncensored. During the interview, Morgan quizzed Brooke about her previous aspirations to be a lawyer before she joined the sex work industry.\u201cI\u2019m just curious about you being someone who embarks on a law career, who\u2019s obviously very bright, went to university, packed it in just for money, to be effectively an online stripper. I mean, that\u2019s what you do, right?\u201d Morgan asked Brooke.The OnlyFans model cheekily replied: \u201cI could be a good lawyer, yes, but also am I good at doing other things on video and camera? Yes.\u201dThe 58-year-old TV personality then asked Brooke how she thinks her future children would feel about her career as a sex worker. \u201cAre you going to be proud that you have your little ones and they look at you and go:\u2018Didn\u2019t you want to be a lawyer?\u2019 and you go: \u2018Yeah, but look at all my stuff!\u2019\u201dRecommendedPiers Morgan defends \u2018good friend\u2019 Holly Willoughby after \u2018patronising\u2019 Phillip Schofield speechOnlyFans model with 7,000 online boyfriends reveals why she doesn\u2019t date in real lifePlus-size travel blogger shares how she secures two seats on \u2018almost every\u2019 flightBrooke responded: \u201cThey can cry in a Ferrari,\u201d leaving Morgan seemingly speechless.A clip of Brooke\u2019s interview with Morgan was reposted to Twitter by viral news account Daily Loud, where it instantly received 35 million views. Twitter users immediately rushed to the comments to applaud Brooke for her \u201cperfect\u201d response to Morgan.\u201cThe perfect response,\u201d replied fellow OnlyFans creator Lily Alcott.\u201cThis is legendary,\u201d said someone else, while another wrote: \u201cHe was speechless.\u201dMeanwhile, some people took the opportunity to defend women in the sex work industry.\u201cIt\u2019s so funny how men\u2019s first argument for OnlyFans is what hypothetical children will think,\u201d shared one user on Twitter, while another said: \u201cI think what her kids will care most about is if she\u2019s a loving and active parent that takes good care of them.\u201d\u201cI love her unapologetic attitude towards being and doing exactly what she wants to do with her brilliant mind and body,\u201d a third person tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s always so funny how mad people get at beautiful women happily winning the game of life.\u201d\u201cThis obsession with asking female sex workers about future kids and husbands is so annoying,\u201d someone else wrote. \u201cWhy does everything women do have to somehow relate to our wombs and the expectations of men? Women are not born to be mothers and wives, we\u2019re born to be autonomous.\u201dAs for Elle Brooke, she joined in on the fun when she replied to the viral interview moment: \u201cIconic if I do say so myself.\u201dOnlyFans is an internet content subscription service created in 2016 by British entrepreneur Timothy Stokely. The online platform and app is largely used by YouTubers, fitness trainers, musicians, and sex workers as a way of making money directly from subscription-based content, rather than using a third party.It now reportedly has more than 120 million registered users with more than two million content creators. The top earners on OnlyFans can make an estimated $100,000 or more monthly, with the platform having paid out more than $5bn to creators since its inception.Many celebrities have joined the subscription-based platform. Recently, model Amber Rose revealed that she\u2019s been open with her 10-year-old son Sebastian Taylor, who she shares with ex-husband Wiz Khalifa, about her OnlyFans career.During an appearance on the High Low with Emratapodcast last February, she shared that one of Sebastian\u2019s peers mentioned her OnlyFans account to him.\u201cHe said that somebody told him: \u2018Your mom is on OnlyFans,\u2019\u201d the model told podcast host Emily Ratajkowski. \u201cAnd it was during the pandemic. I had to work\u2026I had a whole conversation with him about it.\u201dRose also revealed that Sebastian knows that she was \u201ca stripper years ago\u201d and said that telling him about it made her feel \u201cdesensitised\u201d.She continued: \u201cI just explained everything to him, like when it comes to women, you have to let women do what they need to do to support their families.

In 2021, Americans consumed 2.51 gallons of ethanol \u2013 the alcohol found in wine, beer, and spirits \u2013 compared to 2.53 gallons at the brink of the Civil War. That amount, which doesn\u2019t include water or other ingredients found in alcoholic beverages, marks a 60 per cent increase in liquor consumption compared to the mid-1990s.Americans have also changed their taste for alcohol. The amount of beer consumed has dropped nearly 20 per cent since 1995, while wine has steadily become America\u2019s drink of choice. Now, 50 per cent more Americans are drinking wine than they did in the mid-1990s.This isn\u2019t the only time the United States has seen staggering levels of alcohol consumption. In 1934, following the repeal of the Prohibition Act, Americans were drinking one gallon of ethanol per person. At the end of World War II in 1945, Americans reached 2.3 gallons. This, compared to 2.8 gallons in 1980, when alcohol consumption was at its highest.RecommendedModerate alcohol consumption may lower stress, reduce heart disease risk, study findsMan dies after eating raw oysters from Missouri seafood standHip surgery policies based on weight \u2018worsen health inequality\u2019, study warnsThe rise in alcohol consumption may also have to do with a key demographic: women.In March, it was revealed that women in the US are out-drinking men for the first time in history. Dr George Koob, director of the NIAAA, recently told the Washington Examiner that binge drinking among college students are to blame.\u201cIn 2021, there has been an uptick, particularly among women. Now it turns out on college campuses women are actually binge drinking more than men, for the first time in history,\u201d he told the conservative media outlet.The Covid-19 pandemic also saw a dramatic shift in alcohol consumption, as most states declared liquor stores were considered \u201cessential businesses\u201d. In 2020, the first year of the pandemic, sales of alcohol increased by 2.9 per cent, the biggest annual increase in more than 50 years, according to the NIAAA.Now, with college campuses back in session and local bars open again, Koob attributed the rising trend of women binge drinking to the \u201calcohol deprivation effect\u201d \u2013 in which people \u201crebound in drinking\u201d after a period of abstaining from alcohol.RecommendedTikToker cooks rack of ribs in hotel bathroom using only items from his roomBBQ salad recipes without a soggy lettuce leaf in sightHow to shop for and cook Japanese food at home like a pro\u201cA standard drink is 1.5 ounces of vodka, 12 ounces of beer, or five ounces of wine,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you go past a standard drink, you really are getting to the point where alcohol ultimately becomes a toxin.

However, binge drinking usually corresponds to five or more drinks on a single occasion for men, while four or more drinks on a single occasion for women."}, {"_id": "6489ffab51ac3318d5fe4f91", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/heatstroke-symptoms-death-tiktok-b2356973.html", "primaryCategory": "Health &amp; Families", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Woman who was pronounced dead for three minutes due to heatstroke describes what experience felt like", "lead": "<p>\u2018Everything went black and that was the moment I knew I was about to pass away,\u2019 she says </p>", "author": "Amy Walters", "datePublished": "Tue, 13 Jun 2023 22:21:38 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-14 19:58:03.004455", "dateUpdated": "2023-06-13T22:21:38+00:00", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/13/23/heatstroke.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletterStay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter \n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman who says she was pronounced dead for three minutes after battling with heatstroke has reflected on the experience, and the \u201cstrange anomalies\u201d she has experienced since.When Jade, 36, visited a friend during a summer afternoon in Green Bay, Wisconsin, she didn\u2019t expect for her life to be hanging in the balance only hours later.According to Jade, on the day in question, the temperature reached 89.6F, and with the high humidity, it made it feel \u201cunbearable.\u201dSoon after, she started experiencing frequent bouts of nausea, dizziness, dry mouth and exhaustion, which caused her to collapse on the living room sofa.As Jade was rushed to the hospital, medics pronounced her dead for three minutes and said the culprit was heatstroke.RecommendedWhat is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?How to keep your pet cool and healthy during a heatwaveHow to tell if you\u2019re seriously dehydrated, as UK temperatures soarNow, in a bid to raise awareness, she\u2019s shared her story on TikTok, where she\u2019s received more than 191,000 views and over 20,000 likes, and where she said the experience has made her \u201cunafraid\u201d of death.\u201cI had experienced an extreme fear of dying prior to this incident, but when it actually happened, I had zero fear,\u201d the content creator, from Wisconsin, told\u00a0NeedToKnow.co.uk. \u201cI remember feeling consistently yucky and really gross. I was rundown, lethargic and sick to my stomach, with my mouth bone dry.\u201cI went out to smoke and the moment that I finished and stood up, I knew I was in trouble. My priority immediately became getting back inside and I don\u2019t think I understood at this point that I was dying, but I did understand that I was going down.\u201dJade recalls stumbling into the apartment and slumping onto the couch, before making a gurgling sound. (Jam Press)She said: \u201cEverything must have happened in a matter of moments, but it felt like much longer and this profound feeling of utter sickness hit me like a tonne of bricks. My head felt like it was inflating, yet my entire body as if it was shrinking. I had never known anything like it before.\u201cIt made me completely okay with dying because I wanted to sleep forever. Then, everything went black and that was the moment I knew I was about to pass away.\u201dJade was rushed to St Vincent\u2019s hospital via ambulance, where she was revived via a defibrillator.As she arrived, she fell in and out of consciousness, but imaging tests of her head were carried out, along with blood tests and electrocardiograms, a test to check the heart\u2019s rhythm.Over the next four days, she received injections to prevent blood clots and soon, medics told her she had been pronounced \u201cdead\u201d for three minutes on arrival with heatstroke.In the clip, she reflects on the experience and the \u201cweird\u201d occurrences which have happened to her since.Users flocked to the comments to share their reactions, with many detailing their own similar experiences.\u201cI fainted TWICE that summer,\u201d one person said, while another said: \u201cI was pregnant that summer. The heat was HORRIBLE!!!\u201d\u201cYour story was very interesting. Glad you\u2019re safe,\u201d another person added.\u201cWas it scary? What did you see? I really panic about the thought of death,\u201d someone else asked.Jade was born with Wolff Parkinsons\u2019 White and postural tachycardia syndrome, which both cause abnormalities with increased heart rate.Often, she feels like she\u2019s going to \u201cthrow up\u201d her heart and sometimes experiences extreme shakiness as well as fainting spells.Due to this, she finds intense heat triggers these episodes and while her near death experience in July 2011 hasn\u2019t made these worse, she believes they were a contributing factor.\u201cMy symptoms are still mild, but I have been getting new ones, such as a low grade fever and muscle weakness,\u201d she said \u201cI\u2019m not sure if these are related to the heatstroke.\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for a final diagnosis, as this has only occurred after my incident, but I will always fight for myself and my life.\u201dSince then, Jade has also suffered with frequent seizures, which she had never had prior to the incident.She said: \u201cAt first, I thought it was heatstroke again, but I just passed out and doctors believe it\u2019s because I\u2019m still so exhausted from all the anxiety of almost dying. But, I have been admitted a few times for these and I\u2019ve had tests such as MRIs and more blood work done, as well as seeing a neurologist and I\u2019ve been diagnosed with epilepsy.\u201cNow, I don\u2019t have them so much, but I\u2019ve been in touch with other near death experience survivors who said they had seizures for a while after, but then they suddenly stopped.\u201dJade has also experienced other \u201cstrange anomalies\u201d such as not being able to wear regular watches, as they would stop working once she put them on.She said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that happened before and the only watches that are safe are expensive smart watches. I\u2019ve given up on them entirely, but vape pens also shut down even with a full battery.\u201cI\u2019ve also had a lot of spooky things happening, such as hearing voices and seeing things that aren\u2019t there. Sometimes it\u2019s been whispers or dark hazy figures and I began recording my home because I was petrified that I was losing it. I believe this is telling me that life continues after death.\u201dRecommendedWhat is the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke?How to tell if you\u2019re seriously dehydratedWoman shares surprising things \u2018no one tells you\u2019 about weight lossShe continued: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in a special club and it\u2019s made me learn how to take better care of myself, as well as valuing life more.

I work for a major airline and breast milk and anything concerning babies\u2019 food and other items they need are always supposed to be an exception.\u201dAccording to TSA guidelines, breast milk or formula in quantities greater than 3.4 ounces or 100 milliliters are allowed in carry-on baggage. Formula, breast milk, toddler drinks, and any other food for babies or toddlers are considered \u201cmedically necessary\u201d liquids, and a child or infant doesn\u2019t need to be present for a parent to bring breast milk or formula on their flight.However, travellers are recommended to remove the liquid from their carry-ons to be screened separately from the rest of their belongings. The agency suggests that formula and breast milk should be transported in clear, translucent bottles and not plastic bags or pouches, which may require additional screening.Ice packs, freezer packs, frozen gel packs and other accessories required to cool formula or breast milk is also allowed in carry-on bags.While the TSA states that there\u2019s no known \u201cadverse\u201d effects of drinking breast milk that\u2019s been screened by an X-ray, parents are still allowed to tell TSA agents that they don\u2019t want their baby\u2019s milk X-rayed, and will undergo additional screening procedures instead.Meanwhile, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has classified breast pumps as a medical device, and are therefore permitted as a carry-on item.While TSA didn\u2019t specify whether it\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d to throw away breast milk at airport security, agents are required by the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Act (BABES Act) to provide ongoing training to ensure TSA staff receives consistent training related to traveling with breast milk, formula, and infant feeding equipment.In October 2021, US Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson alleged she was \u201cgroped\u201d and publicly humiliated by a TSA agent while attempting to travel with breast milk. The athlete described the incident as \u201cone of the worst experiences,\u201d on her Instagram Stories, where she wrote: \u201cWe as mamas have a duty to our babies and a right in this world to carry breast milk through security\u201d.In the post, which included a photo of clear plastic bags full of breast milk, the mother-of-two claimed that it was against her rights for the unidentified TSA agent to \u201cpublicly humiliate\u201d her by having her prove the liquid she was travelling with was breast milk.RecommendedColin McFarlane diagnosed with prostate cancer7 tips and tricks for hay fever reliefShould you sleep naked?
