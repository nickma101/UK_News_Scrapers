Read our\u00a0privacy noticeThe sister of a headteacher who took her own life following an Ofsted inspection has criticised the school watchdog, claiming proposed reforms are not enough. Professor Julia Waters said the Ofsted inspection at her sister Ruth Perry\u2019s primary school in Reading had been \u2018the worst day\u2019 of her life.Ofsted is set to introduce major changes to the school inspection system after Ms Perry died by suicide in January this year, after a report from the inspectorate found that Caversham Primary School was \u201cgood\u201d in every category apart from leadership and management, where it was judged to be \u201cinadequate\u201d.School headteacher Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection  (Brighter Futures for Children)Ms Waters said the move was \u201ca start\u201d but more changes were needed as they do not \u201cadequately address the many problems that the system creates\u201d.\u201cI am disappointed that no mention is made about removing harmful and misleading single-word judgments,\u201d she told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Monday.RecommendedLabour pledges to revamp Ofsted grading systemOfsted inspectors should \u2018hand in badges\u2019, says sister of late headteacher Ruth PerrySchool leaders\u2019 union to ask headteachers to stop working as Ofsted inspectors\u201cI can understand the need to provide clarity and simplicity for parents about an inspection, but too much is hidden or lost behind a headline judgement of just one or two words,\u201d she added. Professor Waters was responding to comments made on Today by Ofsted\u2019s chief inspector Amanda Spielman. She insisted Ofsted is listening to the concerns raised in the wake of Ms Perry\u2019s death and has been \u201cthinking carefully about how we can revise aspects of our work without losing our clear focus on the needs of children and their parents\u201d.The changes include new funding for wellbeing support for teachers and school leaders, but stop short of banning single-word ratings.Campaigners and MPs are calling for changes to Ofsted including the removal of the one-word grading system  (PA)Ofsted has been under pressure from unions and Labour, who have joined calls for one-word Ofsted assessments to be abolished in the wake of Perry\u2019s death. Education secretary Gillian Keegan has defended the system as clear and easy for parents to understand.However, Professor Waters did call plans to remove a requirement that the inspectorates\u2019 findings stay confidential before results are published a \u201cvery welcome, much-needed change\u201d and also welcomed the additional funding for mental health support.Earlier, schools were not allowed to see how inspectors arrived at their conclusion, thereby making the process of challenging the decision via Ofsted\u2019s complaints more difficult. Ms Perry\u2019s sister Professor Julia Waters called the confidentiality agreement for Ofsted reports \u2018inhumane\u2019  (PA)The watchdog\u2019s officials will still turn up with only a day\u2019s notice, but there will be \u201cmore clarity\u201d about the year schools are likely to be inspected.A change, coming in from September, will see inspection reports refer to the school, rather than individuals, when discussing areas of weakness.Ofsted added that inspectors will be clear that it is up to a headteacher to decide which colleagues, or others, they share their inspection outcome with \u2013 ahead of the report being finalised.Responding to Ms Spielman\u2019s points, Professor Waters said: \u201cNothing she has said would have helped my sister. She didn\u2019t last three months \u2013 she lasted 54 days with that knowledge.\u201dExplaining why the \u2018inhumane\u2019 confidentiality agreement was so harmful, Professor Waters said: \u2018It (the draft report) says categorically that teachers must not share that information and that Ofsted would consider it a serious breach of confidentiality and take appropriate action.\u201cShe told me, her sister, because she told me everything, but it was always couched in this dreadful \u2018Don\u2019t tell anyone - I\u2019ll lose my job if I get found out\u2019.\u201d\u201cEven unburdening herself was a burden because she was so terrified that she would lose her job \u2013 lose her school which she had loved and led for 16 years.\u201dTributes were paid to Ms Perry after her death  (PA Wire)Ms Waters went on to explain one of the reasons why her sister found the inadequate judgement so difficult was that she had invited Ofsted into the school three years previously, determined to get everything in place and believing it would be useful for their school improvement work.Professor Waters said: \u201cThe feedback that she received from the team overseen by Amanda Spielman was glowing - it identified no failings whatsoever. They commented explicitly on the fact that staff are vigilant and safeguarding leads are tenacious.\u201cOne of the reasons that Ruth found that inadequate judgment so devastating was precisely because she had invited Ofsted in three years before and wanted to make sure she had everything in place.\u201cShe was given assurances that the school was functioning well and that their outstanding judgment was valid.\u201dRecommendedEducation Secretary \u2018considering urgent actions\u2019 after Ruth Perry death \u2013 sisterNearly a third of primary schools have no male classroom teachers \u2013 studySchools graded inadequate overall as a result of ineffective safeguarding \u2013 where all other judgements are good or better \u2013 will see inspectors return within three months of an inspection report being published.This is more quickly than has previously been the case and if the school has been able to resolve the safeguarding concerns it is likely to see its overall grade improve, Ofsted said.Also from September schools will be given more clarity about the threshold for effective versus ineffective safeguarding, the watchdog said, adding that ineffective safeguarding will be described more clearly in inspection reports \u201cto help reassure parents and others that these judgements are not made lightly\u201d.If you need to speak to someone, Samaritans are available 24/7 on 116 123.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman has been sentenced to 28 months in jail for obtaining drugs to have an abortion after the legal cut-off in what has been described as a \u201ctragic\u201d case.The 44-year-old, whose identity has not been made public, got hold of the abortion pills under the government\u2019s \u201cpills by post\u201d initiative that was rolled out in the wake of the Covid crisis and is still in operation now. She was 32 to 34 weeks pregnant at the time. The court heard how the mother, who already had three children before she became pregnant again in 2019, had lied to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) during a telephone consultation about how far along her pregnancy was so she could obtain the pills.Abortion providers, campaigners and politicians fiercely criticised the decision to jail the mother as they called for abortion care in the UK to be immediately decriminalised.Despite receiving a letter from healthcare professionals asking him not to imprison the woman for fear it would discourage others from accessing \u201ctelemedical abortion services\u201d or medical care, judge Mr Justice Pepperall imposed a custodial sentence on the woman.RecommendedWomen are waiting too long for abortions, health watchdog finds\u2018Extortionate\u2019 childcare costs pushing women to have abortionsOfsted inspection reforms after headteacher killed herself \u2018not enough\u2019, sister saysSignatories to the letter included the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives.Discussing the letter, Mr Justice Pepperall argued his role as a judge \u201cis to apply the law as provided by parliament and clarified by the Court of Appeal\u201d, adding that it is \u201ca matter for parliament and not for the courts\u201d.He said he did not accept that jailing the woman would \u201cdeter women and girls from lawfully seeking abortion care within the 24-week limit\u201d.He said: \u201cIf the medical profession considers that judges are wrong to imprison women who procure a late abortion outside the 24-week limit then it should lobby Parliament to change that law and not judges who are charged with the duty of applying the law.\u201dThe judge said it would have been better \u201cif the letter had not been written at all.\u201dThe woman will carry out half her sentence in prison and the remaining time under licence. Having a medical abortion involves taking two tablets but can only be carried out up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy in the UK, while surgical abortions can be performed up to 23 weeks and six days into a pregnancy.RecommendedWoman kept in police cell for 36 hours after stillbirth due to suspicions she had \u2018illegal abortion\u2019Prosecuting, barrister Mr Robert Price said the woman had \u201clied to\u201d BPAS about \u201chow pregnant she was, so they sent the tablets to her\u201d.He added: \u201cShe said she had not seen a doctor about her pregnancy because she was embarrassed.\u201cWhile the baby was not full term, she was approaching that stage of development. Multiple and prolonged internet searches showed a level of planning. The taking of the drugs was a planned and deliberate act in which her intention could only have been to procure an abortion.\u201dThe prosecution said the woman made a number of internet searches during lockdown between February and May 2020, including \u201chow to hide a pregnancy bump\u201d, \u201chow to have an abortion without going to the doctor\u201d and \u201chow to lose a baby at six months\u201d.Labour MP Stella Creasy, who is an outspoken campaigner for abortion rights, tweeted: \u201cThis case reveals bitter truth, contrary to what some claim, abortion is not legal in England \u2013 and you can be prosecuted for having one.\u201cNo other healthcare procedure has such a status. No other patient group would be treated this way. It\u2019s time to change [the] law and trust women.\u201dRecommendedFears for vulnerable women amid rise in Britons investigated over illegal abortions by policeWhy are women being arrested for having abortions in the UK?Ms Creasy, who is the MP for Walthamstow, argued it was a \u201changover from another era\u201d that abortion legislation is not founded on \u201chealthcare considerations, but first and foremost criminal sanctions\u201d.The woman was initially charged with child destruction and pleaded not guilty but later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution. The maximum sentence is life imprisonment.RecommendedI had an abortion \u2013 and my experience shows how broken the UK system truly isMr Justice Pepperall said the case was made more \u201ctragic\u201d because the woman did not plead guilty earlier, adding that he may have been able to consider suspending the jail sentence if she had.Abortions are still deemed a criminal act in England, Scotland and Wales under the 1967 Abortion Act.The 1861 legislation means any woman who ends a pregnancy without obtaining legal permission from two doctors, who must agree that continuing with it would be a risk to the woman\u2019s physical or mental health, can face up to life imprisonment. Any medical professional who delivers an abortion out of the terms of the act can face criminal punishment.Recommended\u2018Extortionate\u2019 childcare costs pushing women to have abortions as terminations rise to record levelsAbortion providers, charities, medical bodies and MPs have spent years demanding that abortion is decriminalised in the UK.In a statement released after the sentencing, Clare Murphy, the chief executive of BPAS, said: \u201cWe are shocked and appalled by the decision.\u201cNo woman can ever go through this again. In their sentencing remarks, the judge made it that women will only be protected from prosecution if MPs bring forward legal change. There has never been a clearer mandate for parliamentary action, and the need has never been so urgent.\u201dDr Sarah Salkeld, of abortion provider MSI Reproductive Choices, told The Independent: \u201cThis has been an incredibly distressing case for everyone involved.\u00a0\u201cIt is neither a compassionate nor a proportionate response to send someone to prison for ending their pregnancy. Nor is it in the public interest.\u201dRecommendedAbortion law: Which countries have the strictest laws and what are the punishments?Mandu Reid, leader of the Women\u2019s Equality Party, told The Independent she was \u201cdevastated for the woman at the centre of this case\u201d and \u201cabsolutely furious at the system\u201d.Ms Reid added: \u201cThis sentence is a human rights violation. No one should ever be criminalised or deprived of their liberty for accessing healthcare. This conviction serves absolutely no one \u2013 not the woman, not her children, not the public interest.\u201dA march, calling for legal reform over the issue, has been arranged for Saturday.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeBoris\u00a0Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of \u201ctalking rubbish\u201d over his House of Lords nominations as the increasingly bitter feud between the prime minister and his predecessor descended into open warfare.The astonishing clash came as the former Tory leader faces the final reckoning of his political career after a Commons committee finalised its Partygate report \u2013 expected to find that the former PM deliberately lied to parliament about lockdown parties.Senior Tories expect the damning privileges committee findings to finish off Mr Johnson\u2019s hopes of a comeback, telling The Independent that it would mark \u201cthe end of the circus\u201d.The rancour between Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson descended into a public slanging match on Monday when the PM claimed the former Tory leader has asked him to bend the rules over peerages \u2013 \u201csomething I was not prepared to do\u201d.But a furious Mr Johnson hit back, saying: \u201cRishi Sunak is talking rubbish\u201d \u2013 adding that he had asked the PM to make sure the Lords\u2019 authorities \u201crenew their vetting\u201d.As the extraordinary row deepened, No 10 warned against any attempt to \u201ctraduce\u201d the privileges committee after Johnson allies branded it a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d and compared it to an episode of Black Mirror.

But he is now expected to avoid the embarrassing sanction \u2013 likely to have sparked a by-election \u2013 because he is standing down as the MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip.One senior Tory MP told The Independent they expected the report to be harsh and cement Mr Johnson\u2019s unpopularity with the public, adding: \u201cI think the public are completely fed up with him, as is the party.

Fellow loyalist James Duddridge MP said he would \u201cput a fiver on him coming back \u2013 maybe even before the next election\u201d.Claire Bullivant, chief executive of the Conservative Democratic Organisation, told The Independent: \u201cThis is far from game over for Boris. Whether Boris stands again elsewhere before the next election or comes back later, who knows \u2013 I just know they\u2019re so fearful of him that they\u2019re now trying to ban him for life from parliament.\u201dMr Johnson still faces the prospect of a permanent ban from parliament. If there is a debate on the privileges committee report next week, Labour is reportedly considering a motion to make sure the ex-Tory leader is handed a lifetime suspension.Ms Bullivant said: \u201cThey know he would beat Starmer, that\u2019s why.

But every time he lashes out, he damages himself and gets even further away from coming back \u2013 it\u2019s very unlikely he will be able to make a comeback now.\u201dIn his first public comments since Mr Johnson quit as an MP, a defiant Mr Sunak claimed Mr Johnson asked him to either overrule the House of Lords appointments commission \u2013 which vets peerages \u2013 or \u201cmake promises to people\u201d on the issue.\u201cBoris Johnson asked me to do something that I wasn\u2019t prepared to do because I didn\u2019t think it was right. That was to either overrule the Holac committee or to make promises to people,\u201d the PM said at the London Tech Week conference.But Mr Johnson denied that he had asked Mr Sunak to bend the rules. \u201cRishi Sunak is talking rubbish,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTo honour these peerages it was not necessary to overrule Holac \u2013 but simply to ask them to renew their vetting, which was a mere formality.\u201dMichael Gove says Johnson\u2019s parliamentary career has \u2018ended\u2019  (PA Wire)Former Tory leader Michael Howard \u2013 also a former Holac member \u2013 suggested Mr Johnson was lying about his recent conversation with Mr Sunak. \u201cNot only was he not telling the truth this afternoon, he must have known he wasn\u2019t telling the truth,\u201d he told LBC.The saga over peerages has prompted the immediate resignation of two of those put forward, Mr Johnson\u2019s allies Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams \u2013 triggering three challenging by-elections for the PM as his party trails in the polls.Mr Johnson wrote to the chancellor to formally resign as the MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip, a source close to the former PM confirmed.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMore than 600 migrants have crossed the English Channel in a new daily record this year, days after Rishi Sunak claimed his plan to \u201cstop the boats\u201d was working.Figures released by the Home Office show that 616 people arrived in 12 boats on Sunday, bringing the total so far this year to around 8,400.At the same point last year, the total had just passed 10,000, and last Monday the prime minister hailed the reduction as proof that \u201cour approach is working\u201d.But Border Force sources told The Independent crossings had been suppressed by weeks of rough seas in the Channel, and experts said much of the reduction had resulted from a drop in Albanian migrants rather than an overall change.Afghans are now the most common nationality arriving in small boats, following the collapse in the number of refugees resettled directly from the country following the Taliban\u2019s takeover in 2021.RecommendedSmall boats bill \u2018could lead to more dangerous routes and increase trafficking\u2019Sunak says \u2018stop the boats\u2019 plan is \u2018starting to work\u2019 as he announces two new bargesSunak challenged on timing of small boats speech as crossings drop during strong windsThere were no recorded small boat crossings between 28 May and Saturday, when 154 people made the journey as winds dropped and the sea calmed for the first time in a fortnight.Last Monday, the prime minister hailed progress on his pledge to \u201cstop the boats\u201d, saying that the drop in overall numbers by that point showed \u201cour approach is working\u201d.\u201cThis won\u2019t be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it\u2019s so important that we change the law,\u201d he added. \u201cI said I would stop the boats and I meant it.\u201dStephen Kinnock, Labour\u2019s shadow immigration minister, said Mr Sunak needed to \u201cstop the boast and start stopping the boats\u201d.\u201cThe prime minister got over excited and declared victory in 'stopping the boats' - despite 10,000 asylum seekers crossing the Channel this year,\u201d he added.\u201cWith the weather improving and the number of crossings increasing, Rishi Sunak needs to roll up his sleeves and start doing the hard graft, rather than ploughing on with the headline-chasing, government-by-gimmick approach which landed him in this mess in the first place.\u201dRishi Sunak says he 'will not rest' until small boats are stoppedIn response to the figures, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson claimed crossings \u201cfluctuate on any given day\u201d and Mr Sunak had been speaking about a five-month average.\u201cThe enhanced work with our French counterparts means that you are now more likely to be intercepted and stopped if you attempt to make a crossing than succeed in crossing the Channel,\u201d he added on Monday.\u201cBut, clearly, crossings are continuing and that is because we have not been able to put in place our full plans, and obviously there is a great deal of work across government to that end.\u201dBut on the same day, Home Office submissions to the Court of Appeal said its \u201coperational plans are based on scenarios of up to 56,000 small boat arrivals in 2023\u201d, which would be a new record and a rise of over a fifth on 2022.The disclosure was made as part of an ongoing legal battle over Suella Braverman\u2019s attempt to transform former military bases into asylum accommodation, using a planning bypass for \u201cemergencies\u201d.Experts had cautioned that it was \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether small boat crossings were on course for an overall reduction this year, and if government policy or other factors were behind any changes.Dr Peter William Walsh, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said periods of calm weather over the summer would be the \u201cmain test\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know the extent to which the decline is driven by a fall in Albanian arrivals,\u201d he added.\u201cIt could be that the government\u2019s deterrent policy is having an effect, but it is currently not possible to disentangle the government\u2019s policy changes from the range of other factors that influence irregular arrivals.\u201d (Data: Home Office)Lucy Moreton, of the ISU union which represents Border Force staff, said there was \u201csome evidence that the French are becoming much more effective in deterring crossings\u201d. \u201cThere are also an increased number of attempts being aborted and returning to French soil when a vessel has failed,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, crossings are continuing and planning continues to anticipate a similar number to last year.\u201dThe government has claimed that its new Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to see all small boat migrants detained and deported without consideration of asylum or trafficking claims, will deter crossings.But a parliamentary report published on Sunday said the provisions could lead to asylum seekers taking \u201cmore dangerous routes\u201d to the UK, benefit people smugglers and worsen trafficking.An inquiry by the cross-party joint committee on human rights said the government had not provided any evidence backing claims the bill would deter Channel crossings, and that many of its provisions were unlawful.The government has not yet published an official assessment for the law, which has already been approved by the House of Commons and is being considered by the Lords.During a debate last week, peers accused ministers of pressuring them to pass laws that have \u201cno practical operability\u201d because the UK has insufficient detention capacity to hold all small boat migrants and returns agreements with only two countries.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeCooperation between Labour and the Liberal Democrats could be key to defeating Rishi Sunak\u2019s Conservatives in a slate of upcoming by-elections, a top political scientist has said.Sir John Curtice said tactical voting would be crucial in the seats up for grabs after Boris Johnson and two other Tory MPs quit the Commons.Mr Sunak is facing three difficult electoral tests in Mr Johnson's former West London seat of Uxbridge and West Ruislip, as well as in the constituencies of Mid-Bedfordshire and Selby and Ainsty. These contests were triggered after MPs Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams, both allies for the former PM, follow him out of the door after a row over whether they would get seats in the House of Lords.Writing in The Independent Sir John, a highly respected professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, suggested that all seats were potentially within grasp of opposition parties under the right conditions.But he said previous experience of by-elections showed that in that Mid-Bedforshire especially, opposition prospects could hang on whether Labour decided to mount a serious campaign \u2013 or leave the Lib Dems to hoover up tactical votes.RecommendedBoris Johnson: Sunak\u2019s \u2018talking rubbish\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask PM to bend honours rulesCould tactical voting force Rishi Sunak out of No 10?The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes next\u201cThe Liberal Democrats would need as much as a 24-point swing to take the seat from the Conservatives. But that is less than the 34% swing the party secured in North Shropshire and the 30% swing in Tiverton & Honiton,\u201d he said, referencing two recent by-election upsets pulled off by Sir Ed Davey\u2019s party.\u201cHowever, one key ingredient of those Liberal Democrat successes was the party\u2019s ability to persuade Labour voters to cast an anti-Conservative tactical vote in their favour \u2013 in both instances the Labour vote fell heavily.\u201cThat squeeze was seemingly aided by Labour\u2019s apparent decision not to mount much of a campaign in the seat, a decision that was reciprocated by the Liberal Democrats in the Wakefield by-election where Labour emerged victors.\u201dBoris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge seat \u2018essential\u2019 for Labour, says Prof John Curtice  (N/A)Sir John questioned whether Labour would be willing to take this approach this time around given the wider political context of a looming general election.The top political scientist said that in Uxbridge and West Ruislip, Labour would have the best change of beating the Conservatives \u2013 and that victory \u201cwould seem not just a desirable but an essential target for Sir Keir Starmer\u201d were he on course to win a general election.In Selby, Sir John said Labour has previously enjoyed \u201cenjoyed significant support there in the past\u201d \u2013 though it would need an 18 per cent swing against the Tories to win.Tory peer Lord Hayward told The Independent the byelections will be \u201cserious challenge for the Tories\u201d to win. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for a government to win byelections, even if they have large majorities.\u201dThe elections expert warned Sir Keir Starmer that the contests are also a big challenge for Labour. \u201cThey have to do well to prove they are ready to get the votes they need in some very different constituencies.\u201dDespite the prospect of awkward campaigns ahead, Lord Hayward said Mr Sunak would be relieved to have Mr Johnson and some of his staunchest supporters gone.Rishi Sunak will be relieved to see Boris gone, says top Tory pollster  (AFP/Getty)\u201cDespite the short-term, problematic by-elections, Rishi avoids longer-term problems. Boris is big personality \u2013 he still enormous potential to cause problems. But on balance, it\u2019s cleaner for Rishi to have Boris and those allies outside parliament\u201dThe senior Tory figure added: \u201cI think Rishi Sunak has dodged a bullet. If Boris had fought the byelection, it would have been mayhem \u2013 a really divisive thing for the party, with some going to campaign for him and others not supporting. What would Rishi have done?\u201dNo date has yet been set for the by-elections, with the timing reliant on when the government choses to \u201cmove the writ\u201d in parliament.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOne of Scotland\u2019s leading paediatric doctors said she still does not know what happened at a multi-million pound super hospital to cause infections in a children\u2019s ward.Professor Brenda Gibson, a consultant paediatric haematologist, gave evidence to the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry on Monday, which is investigating a series of contamination issues at the \u00a3840 million Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.Scottish ministers announced the inquiry in the wake of deaths linked to infections at the hospital, including that of 10-year-old Millie Main, who was being treated for cancer at the children\u2019s hospital that is part of the same campus.But on Monday, Professor Gibson, lead of the Schiehallion haemato-oncology unit, said: \u201cThere are two versions of what\u2019s happened. There is a real environmental problem (and) there\u2019s no environmental problem at all. I still don\u2019t know which is true.\n\nYou can\u2019t reassure or tell somebody not to worry about something if you don\u2019t know what the root cause is or what the problem truly is.Professor Brenda GibsonRecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow live\u201cAll I can say is we have had our \u00a311 million refurbishment and we now have what is said to be the best ventilation system that money can buy and we have got water that is coming out of a post-filter tap which has no bacteria in it.\u201dThe professor told inquiry chairman Lord Brodie that she had tried to get explanations for what the issues were at the hospital from the most senior management at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.Alastair Duncan KC, the inquiry\u2019s senior counsel, asked her if she had ever had an answer to what was happening from the very highest level. She replied: \u201cNo.\u201dContamination issues have been linked with water quality and ventilation systems in the super-hospital, which opened in April 2015.The inquiry heard patients in the ward had been moved because of concerns, and then had to be moved again because issues persisted.During her day-long evidence session, the professor said: \u201cFor all of how awful this has been, I do think we are a great team.\u201cI built the unit and I\u2019m very proud of each and every one of them who\u2019s worked in it and, you know, has survived this.\u201cAs Churchill said, when you find yourself walking in hell keep walking. And that\u2019s what we did.\u201cWe did our best and we just want everybody to appreciate that we did do our best, and that we did try endlessly to bring attention to the concerns we had to those above us.\u201dThe toll it had on families had been \u201cconsiderable\u201d, she said. And there had also been an impact on staff, she added.\u201cSome people have described themselves as destroyed,\u201d she told the inquiry.\u201cYou can\u2019t reassure or tell somebody not to worry about something if you don\u2019t know what the root cause is or what the problem truly is.\u201cSo it was very difficult trying to be reassuring and honest and supportive at the same time.\u201cAnd I think as a team we did question what we were doing all of the time, was it right what we were doing, but we did all of this in the background of actually being told on the one hand there was a problem, and on one hand there was no problem.\u201dThe inquiry heard there was an \u201cenormous amount of stress\u201d suffered by the staff, and she had never seen a \u201ctoll taken on staff like it\u201d.She said: \u201cOne has to recognise that the biggest toll was taken by the parents, and I would never say anything that sounded as if I didn\u2019t recognise that because I do, but the strain on some of them, particularly nursing staff, was huge.\u201dThe professor told the inquiry that the responsibility for providing a safe environment for patients lies with the health board.The unit had been based at Yorkhill in the city, and plans were drawn up for it to be moved.

gardens,\u201d Mr Khalil said.He said the prosecution case is that Goncalves assaulted Malik \u201cviolently by shaking him and by striking his head against one or more hard surfaces, causing multiple

he was the father, was in place.Mr Khalil said Olaiya-Imam, 37, \u201csaid he was the father \u2026 although subsequent DNA tests have revealed he was not\u201d.The plan had stipulated that Goncalves, who has mental health issues, was not to drink alcohol, she was not to be left alone with her child and Olaiya-Imam was to contact police if Goncalves was under the influence of alcohol.The plan was put in place on June 25, 2020 following an incident the previous day when police were called to the flat, Mr Khalil said.He said that on June 24 officers who attended the flat after a call from a neighbour found Goncalves \u201chandling (her child) in a rather unsafe manner, slurring her words, unsteady on her feet\u201d.Goncalves was taken into police custody and Olaiya-Imam, who was not at

with no further action and a social services safety plan was put in place.He said that when emergency services attended the flat on August 19, Goncalves claimed \u201csomebody came into the house

shock\u201d.Goncalves, formerly of Joyners Field, Harlow, denies murder, and she denies an alternative count of causing the death of a child.She also denies assaulting an emergency worker who was trying to help Malik.Olaiya-Imam, whose address cannot be reported for legal reasons, denies allowing the death of a child by leaving Malik alone with Goncalves.Mr Khalil said he \u201cwas or ought to have been aware of that risk\u201d and \u201che should have been there to protect\u201d.Both defendants deny cruelty to a child, which Mr Khalil said related to \u201colder injuries\u201d found when Malik was examined after his death.They also both deny doing an act intending to pervert the course of justice, which Mr Khalil said related to a urine sample that Goncalves was asked to provide while at hospital after Malik\u2019s death on August 19.He said that the sample was \u201ccontaminated\u201d, adding that both defendants\u2019 urine was in the single sample.\u201cWe say their act to

That is not the British tradition.\u201dSeveral opposition politicians questioned the vague wording of the law, which states that police can impose conditions on protests that cause disruption that \u201cmay be more than minor\u201d, to the \u201ccommunity\u201d - within and outside the \u201cvicinity of the procession\u201d.SNP MP Alison Thewliss asked: \u201cWhat is minor? Is it a couple of minutes late? What does \u2018affected\u2019 mean? It\u2019s really unclear in this legislation, which will give police a huge amount of discretion.\u201dJoe Middleton12 June 2023 18:171686588991Boris Johnson: Sunak\u2019s \u2018talking rubbish\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask PM to bend honours rulesBoris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of \u201ctalking rubbish\u201d over his House of Lords nominations as the increasingly bitter feud between the prime minister and his predecessor descended into open warfare.The astonishing clash came as the former Tory leader faces the final reckoning of his political career after a Commons committee finalised its Partygate report \u2013 expected to find that the former PM deliberately lied to parliament about lockdown parties.Senior Tories expect the damning privileges committee findings to finish off Mr Johnson\u2019s hopes of a comeback, telling The Independent that it would mark \u201cthe end of the circus\u201d.Adam Forrest and Archie Mitchell report.Boris Johnson: Sunak\u2019s \u2018talking rubbish\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask PM to bend honours rulesTory war of words intensifies, as party braces for verdict on whether Johnson lied about lockdown partiesJoe Middleton12 June 2023 17:561686585615The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes nextIn the fog of the Tory civil war, it\u2019s not always clear who\u2019s winning or even exactly who\u2019s on the field of battle.Sometimes there\u2019s a surprising consensus on the course of events, but also a perplexing conflict over who said what to whom.In particular, the way the nominations for Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list were handled (especially peerages for Nadine Dorries and others), is particularly opaque.But, as they say, we are where we are and it\u2019s good to know how we got here.Sean O\u2019Grady maps out a timeline:The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes nextIn the fog of the Tory civil war it\u2019s good to know how we got here, writes Sean O\u2019Grady Eleanor Noyce12 June 2023 17:001686585283Boris Johnson formally resigns as MPBoris Johnson has written to the chancellor to formally resign as the MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip, a source close to the former PM has said.

She is currently the youngest person ever to sit in the House of Lords, but of course there is no expiration date on her new privilege.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA woman who illegally procured her own abortion when she was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant has been jailed in what a judge called a \u201ctragic\u201d case.The woman, 44, was sent abortion-causing drugs by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) after she called them during lockdown in 2020 and lied about how far along in her pregnancy she was, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard on Monday.The prosecution said the woman, who is not being named, made a number of internet searches between February and May 2020, including \u201chow to hide a pregnancy bump\u201d, \u201chow to have an abortion without going to the doctor\u201d and \u201chow to lose a baby at six months\u201d.The woman, who had three sons before becoming pregnant again in 2019, did not see a doctor about her pregnancy because she was \u201cembarrassed\u201d and did not know how far along she was, the court was told.\n\nShe lied to BPAS about how pregnant she was so they sent the tablets to her. She said she had not seen a doctor about her pregnancy because she was embarrassedProsecutor Robert PriceShe spoke to a nurse practitioner at BPAS, an abortion care service, on May 6 2020 and, based on her answers to questions about her pregnancy, it was determined she was only around seven weeks pregnant and she was sent abortion pills in the post.Days later, on May 11 2020, having taken the pills, a 999 call was made at 6.39pm saying the woman was in labour.Her child was born during the course of the phone call, prosecutors told the court.The baby was not breathing and despite resuscitation attempts by paramedics, who arrived at the scene at about 7pm, she was pronounced dead at hospital around 45 minutes later.A post-mortem examination determined the child was between 32 and 34 weeks\u2019 gestation when born.Her cause of death was recorded as stillbirth and maternal use of abortion drugs.The woman was initially charged with child destruction and pleaded not guilty.She later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution.The maximum sentence is life imprisonment.Prosecuting, barrister Mr Robert Price said: \u201cShe lied to BPAS about how pregnant she was so they sent the tablets to her. She said she had not seen a doctor about her pregnancy because she was embarrassed.\u201cWhile the baby was not full term, she was approaching that stage of development. Multiple and prolonged internet searches showed a level of planning.\u201cThe taking of the drugs was a planned and deliberate act in which her intention could only have been to procure an abortion.\u201dDefending the woman, Barry White said Covid lockdowns had changed the way healthcare and advice services were operating to minimise face-to-face contact.He told the court: \u201cThe restrictions placed on services to advise women may explain why there were so many internet searches for information on behalf of the defendant.\u201cWe can never really know or imagine the turmoil she would have been experiencing at the time.\u201cThe defendant may well have made use of services had they been available at the time. This will haunt her forever.\u201dMr Justice Pepperall acknowledged it is an emotive case and said it was made more \u201ctragic\u201d because the woman did not plead guilty earlier, adding that he may have been able to consider suspending the jail sentence if she had.He said the woman, who was given a 28-month extended sentence, will serve 14 months in custody and the remainder on licence after her release.He added: \u201cThis case concerns one woman\u2019s tragic and unlawful decision to obtain a very late abortion.\u201cThe balance struck by the law between a woman\u2019s reproductive rights and the rights of her unborn foetus is an emotive and often controversial issue.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeA mother and her two young daughters were murdered by their neighbour who set their flat on fire because he was unhappy about bags of rubbish being left in an alleyway behind their building, a court heard.Nottingham Crown Court was told Jamie Barrow poured petrol through the letterbox of Fatoumatta Hydara\u2019s first-floor property in the early hours of November 20 last year, before setting it alight and staying while the blaze took hold.Mrs Hydara, 28, died two days after the incident, while her daughters Fatimah Drammeh and Naeemah Drammeh, aged three and one, were both killed in the fire in Fairisle Close, Clifton, Nottingham.The prosecution said the defendant \u201cwalked casually away\u201d despite screams being heard from inside the flat.Jurors were told Barrow, 31, had raised a \u201cgrievance\u201d with the local authority around a month before the blaze, but prosecutor Simon Ash KC said it was not accepted that Mrs Hydara had been leaving rubbish in the alleyway.Opening the case to a packed public gallery on Monday, Mr Ash said the defendant has admitted starting the fire but denies murder.He said: \u201cThe defendant in this case is charged with three offences of murder.\u201cHe killed a woman called Fatoumatta Hydara, and he killed her two daughters Fatimah Drammeh and Naeemah Drammeh.\u201cThe defendant killed them by setting fire to their flat in the early hours of the morning on November 20 last year.\u201d\n\nAbout five minutes later, he walked casually away, leaving Mrs Hydara and Fatimah and Naeemah trapped in the burning flatProsecutor Simon Ash KCMr Ash said Mrs Hydara and her two children were asleep in the flat when the fire was started.He continued: \u201cHe poured petrol through their letterbox and he set it alight.\u201cThe defendant knew that the front door was the only way in and out of the flat.\u201cHe knew that there would be no way for them to escape.\u201dMr Ash told the jury that Barrow stayed as the blaze took hold and that a fire alarm sounded after it started.He said: \u201cShortly after (the alarm), Mrs Hydara or one of the children started screaming.\u201cThe defendant did nothing to help them.\u201cHe didn\u2019t call the fire service or alert anyone to what was happening.\u201cAbout five minutes later, he walked casually away, leaving Mrs Hydara and Fatimah and Naeemah trapped in the burning flat.\u201cAll three of them died as a result of the fire.\u201dMr Ash said before setting the flat alight, Barrow had walked past the property while the light was on as he was on his way to buy some beer.\u201cThere would have been some light coming from her flat and the light would have been further indication to the defendant that Mrs Hydara and the children were in the flat at the time.\u201dIn a previous statement, Aboubacarr Drammeh, the children\u2019s father, said his wife was a \u201cvery faithful person\u201d, who was \u201ccaring\u201d and would help \u201cwhoever she could\u201d.He also said of his children: \u201cThey were both really happy children.

Is that what you were in it for?Prosecutor Anna PopeBut she maintained throughout that she thought the woman she had sex with believed she was really a woman and not a man.Ms Pope said: \u201cYou knew she was not going to be sexually attracted to you as Georgia Bilham?\u201dThe defendant replied: \u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201dMs Pope said sex took place based on the complainant believing she was having sex with a man. Bilham said she enjoyed no sexual gratification from the encounters.And Bilham again said she believed the complainant knew she was a female but Bilham did not want to tell her who she really was.Ms Pope continued: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just say you are a female with a different name?\u201dBilham replied: \u201cBecause I was caught in a web of lies.\u201dMs Pope added: \u201cYou were getting a buzz out of deceiving her into believing you were a man. Is that what you were in it for?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d replied Bilham.Earlier Bilham told the court she had been \u201ca bit of a tomboy\u201d when she was younger and had a difficult relationship with her mother after she split from her father when Bilham was a teenager.Bilham said she had never wanted to change her gender to a boy but had questioned her own sexuality and that her mother would \u201cnot be happy\u201d if she was in a same-sex relationship.Asked why she set up the fake Snapchat account pretending to be a boy, Bilham replied: \u201cI just was not happy in myself. I just, it was just more like an escape. I don\u2019t know.\u201dShe added: \u201cI was not confident in myself. It was a stupid thing to do. It was a way of not being me.\u201dMs Pope asked the defendant: \u201cDo you agree part of that \u2018not being you\u2019 was you being a girl?\u201dBilham replied: \u201cAt the time, yeah.\u201d\n\nI think they told her I was female. It was not George, it was GeorgiaGeorgia BilhamBilham said after the first time they met in person the complainant messaged her to say \u201cThere\u2019s something weird about you\u201d, and blocked her on Snapchat.But there continued an online \u201clove hate relationship\u201d which became \u201ctoxic\u201d at times, the court heard.After Bilham passed her driving test in April 2021 they agreed to go for a drive together in the countryside, where they were together in her car for five hours.On another drive on May 11, 2021 Bilham crashed her mother\u2019s car into a hedge and police were called asking for her licence, which had her real name.Bilham told the jury she believed a police officer called to the scene revealed to the complainant her true identity.She said: \u201cI think they told her I was female. It was not George, it was Georgia.\u201dShe added: \u201cI believe she knew about my gender the night of the crash.\u201dBilham said she stayed overnight at the complainant\u2019s home, sleeping in her bed, but always wearing a tracksuit with a hood-up.Martine Snowdon, defending, asked Bilham, \u201cYou were touching her sexually.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMadeleine McCann, a three-year-old girl from Rothley, Leicestershire, was reported missing from the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on the Algarve on 3 May 2007, a case still unsolved and still the subject of intense interest among the public and press.Her parents, Kate McCann and Gerry McCann, posted a statement on the Find Madeleine website on 3 May 2023 marking the latest anniversary of their daughter\u2019s disappearance, reiterating their hopes of being reunited with her one day and posting a poem, \u201cThe Contradiction\u201d by Clare Pollard, to express their feelings.\u201cToday marks the 16th anniversary of Madeleine\u2019s abduction. Still missing... still very much missed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe police investigation continues, and we await a breakthrough. Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps.\u201dFollow all the latest updates on The Independent\u2019s liveblogHere is a reminder of the events of the case.RecommendedMadeleine McCann news \u2013 latest: Soil from reservoir compared to samples from prime suspect\u2019s vanHow Madeleine McCann search at reservoir unfolded \u2013 and what police foundRead Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner\u2019s bombshell prison letters for the first timeThe story began when the McCanns \u2013 affluent doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean \u2013 joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort\u2019s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming \u201cMadeleine\u2019s gone! Someone\u2019s taken her!\u201d The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl\u2019s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.Madeleine McCann (PA)The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their \u201canguish and despair\u201d over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.On 26 May, police issued a description of a suspicious man seen on the night of the girl\u2019s disappearance. The individual in question was spotted by Jane Tanner, one of the McCanns\u2019 dining companions, who said she had seen a Mediterranean man with dark hair and beige trousers carrying a child close to the apartment when she went to check in on her own children. Scotland Yard would later come to dismiss the sighting as a red herring.The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine\u2019s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney. By 30 May, the case was such a cause celebre that they were being flown out to meet the Pope at the Vatican in Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Learjet.A local man, Robert Murat, subsequently became its first suspect and had his house and car searched, his swimming pool drained and his electronic devices confiscated but no evidence was found to link him to Madeleine and the matter was soon dropped.By June, the Portuguese police admitted that they had failed to protect potentially useful evidence at the scene as frustration with the lack of developments grew and the media began to question whether the McCanns themselves had been involved in the matter. Lurid tabloid allegations suggested the couple and their friends might have been swingers and that the McCanns, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children, while others claimed inconsistencies in their version of events.The intensity of the hostility towards the parents would later be described by Roy Greenslade of The Guardian as \u201cno journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\u201d, singling out The Daily Express and Daily Star for particular condemnation.In July, assistance offered by former South African police officer Danie Krugel \u2013 who claimed his handheld \u201cmatter orientation system\u201d could help to find Madeleine \u2013 was rubbished, while British police sent over two springer spaniel sniffer dogs to search for DNA. Gerry and Kate McCann (PA)Relations with the local authorities would ultimately sour as the latter came to resent British intrusion into a Portuguese inquiry, according to Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan\u2019s book Looking for Madeleine (2014).By August, Madeleine has been missing for 100 days and police admitted for the first time that she may never be found. They also told the McCanns that they were no longer considering the matter an abduction case but, rather, a murder inquiry.The McCanns themselves were interviewed as \u201carguidos\u201d (suspects) by Portuguese police in September, with the parents told that the dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car, lines of inquiry that had already been leaked to the British press. They vehemently denied having any part in her disappearance.Despite being listed as suspects (a designation that would linger until the following July), the McCanns were allowed to return to Britain on 9 September. A day later, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine McCann had died in their apartment as a result of an accident, that the tapas dinner and rota checks on the McCann children had been part of a planned cover-up, that the family\u2019s friends had helped to mislead the police and that the McCanns had concealed the body and then faked an abduction. A public prosecutor subsequently applied for the confiscation of Kate McCann\u2019s diary and Gerry McCann\u2019s laptop plus the group\u2019s phone records.On 2 October, chief inspector Goncalo Amaral was removed from the case and transferred after alleging that the British police were only interested in pursuing leads favourable to the McCanns. He would later publish a book, Maddie: The Truth of the Lie, the following summer, resulting in a lengthy libel battle with the McCanns that would run back and forth through the courts until March 2017.Back in Britain, Gerry McCann issued a video that November in which he speculated that his family had been watched by a \u201cpredator\u201d during their stay at Praia da Luz. His wife had come to believe that a potential perpetrator could have seen a note in the resort\u2019s guest book visible to all in reception noting their dining arrangements on the evening of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance. The couple followed up on 20 January 2008 by releasing a sketch of a \u201ccreepy man\u201d they said other holidaymakers had said they had seen loitering at the Ocean Club.In April, a month before the one-year anniversary of the fateful night, Portuguese police travelled to Leicestershire to conduct further interviews with the McCanns\u2019 friends.RecommendedWhat happened to Madeleine McCann? Five possible scenarios as Netflix documentary releasedThen, on 21 July, Portugal\u2019s attorney general, Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link either the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance and closed the case, unsolved.With the trail cold and no closure in sight, the McCanns continued to publicise their cause, issuing computer-generated images of how Madeleine might look now that she had aged on 3 November 2009 and condemning the release of previously unseen Portuguese police files \u2013 detailing possible sightings of their daughter \u2013 to British newspapers in March 2010.The McCanns published a book of their own about their ordeal in May 2011, entitled simply Madeleine, which was serialised in The Sun as the newspaper led a campaign calling on British prime minister David Cameron to launch a new inquiry. He did so. Commenced by then-home secretary Theresa May, the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Operation Grange would be led by commander Simon Foy and comprise a team of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables and six civilian staff.It began to yield results in 2013, with Scotland Yard formally announcing a new investigation in July and saying in October it had identified 41 potential suspects. That same month, BBC Crimewatch released an e-fit image of a man of particular interest who had been seen in Praia da Luz with a child matching Madeleine\u2019s description in May 2007.Detectives arrived in Portugal in January 2014 promising new arrests and finally searched the village in June, interviewing four people the following month but without unearthing new information. The quartet would be definitively ruled out in April 2017, before the UK government said it would continue to fund the investigation until 2020, having already admitted it had cost \u00a310m in its first four years of operation.That investment had enabled detectives to have tens of thousands of documents translated, investigate over 8,000 potential sightings, take 1,338 statements, collect 1,027 exhibits and investigate 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest, all without definitively establishing the truth.The Madeline McCann case lay dormant before suddenly exploding into life in June 2020 when German media revealed that Christian Brueckner, a 43-year-old prisoner with a track record of child abuse and drug trafficking, had been identified as a new suspect by the public prosecutor of the German city of Braunschweig. Christian Brueckner (AFP/Getty)He had reportedly been living in a Volkswagen camper van in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance and one woman has since come forward to suggest she saw a girl that might have been Madeleine speaking German in a supermarket in Portugal in 2017.German investigators classified their probe into his movements as a murder inquiry, saying they were working on the assumption that Madeleine is dead and reporting in July 2021 that they had found an abandoned cellar beneath his former allotment near Hanover where she could, theoretically, have been held captive.Hans Christian Wolters, the prosecutor leading the investigation into Brueckner, has said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d the inmate is responsible for kidnapping her. \u201cIf you knew the evidence we had you would come to the same conclusion as I do but I can\u2019t give you details because we don\u2019t want the accused to know what we have on him \u2013 these are tactical considerations,\u201d he told the BBC. It was subsequently revealed that Madeleine\u2019s Fund still had \u00a3773,629 to spend as of 31 March 2020, meaning the McCanns can continue to bankroll a private investigation to find their daughter long after the police hunt is finally drawn to a close, should they choose to.Brueckner was formally made a \u201carguido\u201d in relation to the case on 21 April 2022.On 19 September, the McCanns lost their libel case against Mr Amaral, the former chief inspector who had investigated the disappearance, before the European Court of Human Rights. The couple had attempted to argue that Mr Amaral was responsible for damaging their reputation and breaching their rights to respect for their private life and to be presumed innocent after taking exception to his book and associated media appearances in which he had repeatedly suggested they were responsible for the vanishing.Their complaint also argued that Portugal\u2019s Supreme Court had failed to allow them proper redress over the alleged libel by Mr Amaral after judges threw out their earlier claim in 2017.The verdict left the McCanns with three months to appeal against the decision.In February 2023, a Polish woman called Julia Faustyna made headlines by claiming she was Madeleine, using the Instagram name @iammadeleinemccann.Ms Faustyna, 21, did not provide any supporting evidence but sought DNA tests to prove her origins. The results ultimately revealed that she was entirely of Polish origin, with no British heritage, disproving her claims for good. In April 2023, a court in Braunschweig dropped a rape charge against Brueckner, unrelated to the Madeleine McCann case, concluding it did not have jurisdiction.Police in Germany continue to claim they have \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d that Madeleine is dead but this has still not been confirmed and their investigation is ongoing, with Brueckner still not charged in the McCann case. Investigators explore the Barragem do Arade beauty spot (EPA)Like her parents, Madeleine\u2019s sister Amelie, now 18, observed the 16th anniversary of her disappearance in May 2023.Speaking publicly for the first time at a prayer meeting in Rothley, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice that everyone is here together but it\u2019s a sad occasion.\u201dAmelie McCann reportedly joined in with chants including \u201cNever never give up\u201d, \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t forget about me\u201d and \u201cstill missing, still missed\u201d.Later that month, the case unexpectedly lurched back into life in when investigators launched a major search operation at a reservoir in the Algarve, with Mr Wolters saying they were acting on \u201ccertain tips\u201d from Brueckner, whom the prosecutor said he remains \u201cvery confident\u201d holds the key to Madeleine\u2019s disappearance.With help from Portuguese police and with Scotland Yard detectives watching on, German investigators carried out a thorough examination of the Barragem do Arade beauty spot in Silves.They combed the shoreline and surrounding grasslands with sniffer dogs, rakes, spades and pickaxes and inspected the water in a rigid-hull inflatable boat. A no-fly zone was put in place in the skies overhead to allow police drones to survey the region undisturbed.The site is located approximately 30 miles northeast of the Ocean Club resort, from which the missing girl first disappeared.In their most recent update, the investigators said they were comparing soil samples from the reservoir with others taken from Brueckner\u2019s VW camper van in an attempt to establish for certain that he was in the area during the timeframe of interest in order to try to \u201cclose the net\u201d around him."}, {"_id": "64875f2d51ac331e85b9da5f", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nick-gibb-london-commons-twitter-snp-b2356062.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Banning pupils from addressing staff as \u2018sir\u2019 won\u2019t help retaining teachers \u2013 MP", "lead": "Sir Desmond Swayne says that schools should replace \u201cmiss\u201d with \u201cma\u2019am\u201d.", "author": "Martina Bet", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 15:46:53 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:45.279606", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/16/5c74154dafc5517657076ad3313eab3dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjcwNzYy-2.71322858.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

It includes Dorries, Adams, Sharma et al. However, perhaps in a tragic and colossal misunderstanding/blunder on their part or Mr Johnson\u2019s, they believed they could accept peerages as serving MPs without declaring they were standing down as MPs. So they were technically ineligible for the Lords anyway. By the time they learned this, last week, it was too late to fix, and Downing Street wasn\u2019t helping them either.

They were also disturbed by the fresh revelations about parties at Chequers. These factors, rather than being leant on by Tory whips, seem to have been the determining ones. A suspension of more than 10 days (triggering a by-election) becomes a growing possibility, pending another Johnson response, but not the outcome of police inquiries.

It lasts for 45 minutes and is an attempt to end the \u201cpsychodrama\u201d. Mr Johnson, Mr Sunak and Sunak aide James Forsyth are in attendance; only Forsyth takes notes. Mr Johnson asks Mr Sunak to: halt the Select Committee Inquiry; make Mr Johnson envoy to Ukraine; and approve the Johnson resignation honours, including peerages for Johnson loyalists Nadine Dorries, Alok Shama and Nigel Adams, plus other honours for two donors \u2013 David Ross and Stuart Marks. Mr Sunak refuses to offer any guarantees and is \u201cSphinx-like\u201d according to sources, telling his predecessor as he left the meeting: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave this room thinking I have made you a promise as that will be a problem in our relationship going forward\u201d.

But both and others hear nothing, and when they ask, are told nothing by HOLAC or Downing Street. It\u2019s around this time that Mr Johnson is finally informed that Mr Sunak isn\u2019t going to rescue him, and whip Tory MPs to vote down the privileges committee report, whatever the PM may or may not have appeared to promise.

Sunak declassifies and publishes the actual list of peers approved by HOLAC, according to the letter sent to the PM by the chair of HOLAC, Lord Bew. Ms Dorries and the others aren\u2019t on the list.What happens next?Monday 12 June: Privileges Committee meets to discuss the most recent developments. On the agenda will be how to account for recent events and Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation and (presumably) refusal to engage with the process. They are likely to press on with their report and recommendations and may retain the sanction of a 20-day suspension for Mr Johnson which (arguably) will be valid for the rest of this parliament (in case it comes back). They\u2019ll also consider Mr Johnson\u2019s renewed attack on their integrity as an additional contempt of parliament. Withdrawing the customary parliamentary pass for ex-MPs is an option. They might also condemn those in the Commons who\u2019ve echoed Johnson\u2019s critique, either in their report or via a motion of censure proposed to the Commons Speaker Linday Hoyle. Mr Hoyle may also warn MPs not to trash their colleagues on the committee doing their duty.Tory MP Tobias Ellwood called for Mr Johnson to not be allowed to stand as an MP until he has shown \u201ccommitment\u201d to the party (Getty)The government may well move three writs for the pending by-elections, with a view to getting them all out of the way, preferably in one day.Wednesday 14 June: Probably the day when the Commons Privileges Committee will publish its report and recommendations, for consideration by the whole House.

Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps,\u201d they added.Here\u2019s a look at the family, whose lives have been defined by the mystery.Parents Kate and Gerry McCannMadeline\u2019s mother was born Kate Marie Healy in Huyton near Liverpool in 1968.After attending All Saints School in Anfield and Notre Dame High School in Everton Valley, she took a degree in medicine from the University of Dundee and graduated in 1992. Beginning her career by specialising in obstetrics, gynaecology and anaesthetics, she subsequently became a GP.She met her future husband Gerald Patrick McCann in 1993 and they married in 1998. Madeleine, their eldest child, was born in 2003 and the couple had twins, Amelia and Sean, in 2005.Mr McCann was born in Glasgow in 1968 and attended Holyrood RC Secondary School before graduating from the University of Glasgow with a bachelor of science degree in physiology and sports science in 1989.He obtained his medical doctorate from the same institution in 2002 and has worked as a consultant cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, since 2005, with the family setting up home in Rothley, Leicestershire.The couple are still waiting for answers to explain what happened to their daughter  (PA)After Madeleine\u2019s disappearance from the family\u2019s rented apartment complex \u2013 while her parents and a group of friends ate dinner at an open-air tapas restaurant, a member of the party checking on the otherwise-unattended children every half-hour \u2013 the McCanns led the public appeals for information and became fixtures on newspaper front pages and television screens. They were also subjected to lurid tabloid allegations suggesting that they and their friends might be swingers or, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children. Others claimed to have spotted inconsistencies in their account of the night\u2019s events, insinuating that they might have been involved in their daughter\u2019s disappearance.The intensity of the hostility towards the McCanns would later be described by Roy Greenslade of The Guardian as \u201cno journalistic accident\u201d and \u201ca sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\u201d.The couple were interviewed as \u201carguidos\u201d (suspects) by the Portuguese authorities in September 2007, with the parents told that police dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car. They vehemently denied the accusations against them and subsequently launched a libel action against one of the detectives who had gone on to write a book about the case.Madeleine McCann\u2019s mystery disappearance has fascinated the public for years  (PA)After the family returned to England, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report alleging that Madeleine had died in the holiday apartment as a result of an accident (rather than been abducted by a stranger), that the tapas dinner and rota checks had been part of a planned cover-up, that the family\u2019s friends had helped to mislead the police and that the McCanns had concealed her body and then faked a kidnapping.That official suspicion lingered until July 2008 when Portugal\u2019s attorney general, Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link either the McCanns or another suspect, local man Robert Murat, to the disappearance after all and closed the case unsolved.The McCanns refused to give up, issuing computer-generated images of how their daughter might look with the advancing years, publishing their own book, entitled simply Madeleine (2011), and endorsing a successful campaign to pressure then-prime minister David Cameron into reopening the case. He did so.The result was Operation Grange, which saw officers return to Portugal in 2014 and investigate tens of thousands of documents at great expense, without definitively establishing the truth, causing the case to lie dormant for several years until Brueckner emerged as a new suspect in 2020.Portuguese police investigators dismantle base camp at the end of the three-day search for remains of Madeleine  (Getty)Writing in Madeleine, Kate McCann discussed the toll the ordeal had taken on her devout Roman Catholic faith, stating: \u201cThere have been many times when I\u2019ve felt God has deserted me or that He has let Madeleine down. I\u2019ve occasionally doubted His existence altogether. And yes, I\u2019ve been angry with Him.\u201cFor now, though, at least, my anger towards God seems to have subsided. I believe in Him and I still feel His presence.\u201dSiblings Amelia and Sean McCannOut of respect for their privacy, especially given their ages, Madeleine\u2019s younger siblings have largely been shielded from the glare of the spotlight.However, Amelie McCann, now 18, did join her parents in remembering her missing sister on the 16th anniversary of her disappearance on 7 May this year.Speaking publicly for the first time at a prayer meeting in Rothley, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice that everyone is here together but it\u2019s a sad occasion.\u201dMs McCann reportedly joined in with chants including \u201cNever never give up\u201d, \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t forget about me\u201d and \u201cstill missing, still missed\u201d.Her parents were among the 70-strong crowd in attendance but her brother Sean was not, preferring to remain off stage.Rob Gladstone, leading prayers at the event, told his audience: \u201cWe are here this evening to show our loving concern for Madeleine and for all young children who have been taken away from their families against their will.\u201cWe are also here to encourage one another to keep up hope and pray for a renewal of strength even after this long time.\u201dKate McCann says their ordeal has tested her faith  (Getty)Reflecting on the importance of the twins in keeping their family unit together in a 2017 interview with the BBC\u2019s Fiona Bruce, Gerry McCann said the ordeal had forced them to face \u201ca new normality\u201d in living without their daughter.Kate McCann added: \u201cWhat people do say is that you don\u2019t realise how strong you are until you have no option.\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s very true. Obviously massive events like this cause a lot of reaction, a lot of trauma and upset. But ultimately you have to keep going \u2013 and especially when you have got other children involved.\u201cSome of that is subconscious I think \u2013 your mind and body just take over to a certain extent. But if you can\u2019t change something immediately, you have to go with it and do the best that you can.\u201dThe couple also addressed the online abuse they have received, commenting: \u201cI\u2019m sure it is a very small minority of people who spend their time doing it, but it has totally inhibited what we do.\u201cPersonally, we don\u2019t use social media, although we have used it in Madeleine\u2019s campaign.RecommendedHow much has the Madeleine McCann investigation cost?What happened to Madeleine McCann?

MPs have pledged to continue the investigation process despite Mr Johnson\u2019s Commons exit amid accusations of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. But Downing Street has backed the committee, insisting is is \u201cdoing exactly what Parliament asked\u201d.

I had never taken a test and it telling me I was pregnant,\u201d Mayo told the jury.\n\nI was worried I might be (pregnant) as I was putting on weight, but I was trying to put it down to other thingsParis Mayo\u201cI was more suspicious I could have been, rather than actually knowing if I was or not.\u201cI would just try and make excuses to myself to what I thought was wrong. I was worried I might be as I was putting on weight, but I was trying to put it down to other things.\u201cI was eating bigger portions of food and eating throughout the day.\u201dMr Richmond asked: \u201cWas there a stage before the birth you said to yourself, \u2018I am pregnant\u2019?\u201dMayo replied: \u201cNo.\u201dDescribing her on and off sickness in the autumn of 2018, Mayo told the court: \u201cI think there were times when I was sick, but it would go back and come away \u2013 it was irregular.\u201cI thought it was a stomach bug that went away, or I had eaten something that disagreed with me.\u201dMr Richmond asked: \u201cDid you ever equate that with being pregnant?\u201dMayo replied: \u201cNo.\u201dJurors were told Mayo had been taken to see her GP in October 2018 by her mother and during the examination was asked if she was having sex.Mayo told the court: \u201cShe asked me at that time if I was having sex and at that time I told her no because at that time I wasn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\u201cI think I must have misunderstood how she was asking it. I felt like I could have told her if I felt comfortable enough, but I didn\u2019t know how to go about it.\u201dMr Richmond asked if her mother knew she had been having sex and Mayo replied: \u201cI think she knew I had but she thought I had stopped having sex with people.\u201cI think she knew before that I had lost my virginity but believed I had stopped having sex with people.\u201dThe jurors were told Stanley would have been conceived when Mayo was 14 with the teenager losing her virginity at 13.Explaining why she started having sex so young, Mayo said: \u201cI just thought it was a way to get people to like me because I was quite insecure about the way I looked and the way I was made to feel about myself at home because my family situation was quite bad.\u201cI was always being patronised and belittled and told I was worthless. I just wanted to feel a bit more validated and the way I felt to get that was to have sex with people.\u201d\n\nI started to panic because he wasn\u2019t crying or making a noise and I got really scared. It all happened so fast, I don\u2019t really remember a lot about itParis MayoMayo told the jury she only acknowledged to herself being pregnant shortly before she gave birth.\u201cHe wasn\u2019t crying or making any noise and his eyes weren\u2019t open,\u201d she said.\u201cI started to panic because he wasn\u2019t crying or making a noise and I got really scared. It all happened so fast, I don\u2019t really remember a lot about it.\u201cI just remember he hit his head and that was really it. The cord was around his throat when I undone it and that was when it was broken.\u201dMr Richmond asked: \u201cStanley had skull fractures. Did you do them to him deliberately?\u201dMayo replied: \u201cNo.\u201dAsked about putting cotton wool balls in Stanley\u2019s mouth, she replied: \u201cTo me it looked like there was stuff coming out of his mouth.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeActress Nikki Sanderson became emotional as she described the \u201chumiliating\u201d process of giving evidence in her High Court claim against the Mirror\u2019s publisher over alleged unlawful information-gathering.Former Coronation Street star Ms Sanderson, 39, is suing Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) for damages, claiming journalists at its titles \u2013 The Daily and Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People \u2013 were linked to methods including phone hacking, so-called \u201cblagging\u201d or gaining information by deception, and use of private investigators for unlawful activities.The actress, who played Candice Stowe in the ITV soap between 1999 and 2005, finished her evidence on Monday afternoon after entering the witness box on Friday.At the end of her evidence, she was asked by her barrister David Sherborne how being in the witness box for a day-and-a-half had felt.Appearing tearful, after a short pause Ms Sanderson replied: \u201cHumiliating.\u201d\n\nIt's been a horrific experience from the start to the endNikki SandersonShe continued: \u201cSome of it\u2019s really embarrassing,\u201d adding that other parts of it were \u201ctraumatising\u201d.\u201cNo one wants to be in the witness box feeling as if you\u2019re on trial,\u201d she added.As Ms Sanderson left the witness box on Friday, the actress was told not to discuss her evidence with anyone over the weekend.She then said she had felt isolated during the break, adding: \u201c(Family) can\u2019t help because they don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going through.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a horrific experience from the start to the end,\u201d Ms Sanderson concluded.The actress is bringing her claim in relation to 37 articles published in Mirror titles between 1999 and 2009.MGN has previously denied that 35 of the 37 articles involved phone hacking or unlawful information-gathering, with one article being not admitted.During the second day of her evidence, Ms Sanderson was taken through several of the articles by MGN\u2019s barrister, along with some examples of similar stories in non-MGN publications.One of these stories, a short piece in the Daily Mirror from May 2005, showed Ms Sanderson and her then-boyfriend Danny Young on a beach together, which MGN say came from a photography agency.Ms Sanderson described the photo as \u201cunflattering\u201d, adding: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how they knew I was talking about going on holiday with my friends.\u201d\n\nI'm not public property, I'm not a commodity, I'm not an object, I'm still a humanNikki SandersonThe actress, who has also played Maxine Minniver in the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks since 2012, was then taken to a front-page photoshoot she starred in with the men\u2019s magazine Maxim in August 2005.Ms Sanderson told the court: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to do it, I\u2019ve got control on the day, I\u2019ve consented to it.\u201dAndrew Green KC, for MGN, said: \u201cYou took the view that this sort of article was good for your career.\u201d\u201cThis sort of article is something I consented to,\u201d the actress replied. \u201cI should have consent over my own life and own image, who I see.\u201dMs Sanderson later told the court that she is \u201cwithin my rights\u201d to make her choices.She continued: \u201cI\u2019m not public property, I\u2019m not a commodity, I\u2019m not an object, I\u2019m still a human. I have the right to choose what I\u2019m doing.\u201dMs Sanderson added that having done interviews and photoshoots \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that the illegal activity against me is okay\u201d.In its trial defence, the publisher says Ms Sanderson\u2019s claim is brought too late but \u201cunreservedly apologises\u201d over four payments made to private investigators which it admits are evidence of instructions to unlawfully obtain her private information.Mr Green told the court on Friday that the evidence in Ms Sanderson\u2019s case is \u201cweak\u201d and the publisher does \u201cnot accept that it establishes a case of voicemail interception\u201d and does not show \u201csystemic hacking\u201d of her phone.Ms Sanderson\u2019s case is one of four representative claims being heard in London, alongside similar claims brought by the Duke of Sussex, Coronation Street actor Michael Turner, known professionally as Michael Le Vell, and comedian Paul Whitehouse\u2019s ex-wife Fiona Wightman."}, {"_id": "64875f2f51ac331e85b9da6b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/wirral-wallasey-liverpool-crown-court-merseyside-hmp-manchester-b2355982.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Christmas Eve pub shooting accused admits handling stolen goods", "lead": "Connor Chapman pleaded guilty to the charge ahead of his trial for the murder of Elle Edwards who was shot in Wallasey, Wirral on Christmas Eve.", "author": "Eleanor Barlow", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 14:55:11 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:47.568248", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/14/46e3759904dc14616164b28e331250d9Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjYzNDkx-2.71650706.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

He took office as prime minister in 2019, leading the Conservative Party to a landslide election victory with a pledge to \u201cget Brexit done.\u201dJohnson took Britain out of the EU the following year. But he became mired in scandals over his ethics and judgment, and was forced out as prime minister by his own party in mid-2022. He remained a lawmaker until unexpectedly resigning on Friday.Sturgeon, 52, is a confident, literature-loving politician who became leader of the Scottish National Party and of Scotland\u2019s semi-autonomous government in 2014. She helped build the SNP into a formidable election-winning machine, and transformed it from a largely one-issue pro-independence party into a dominant governing force with liberal social positions.But she fell short on her main aim of leading Scotland to independence from the United Kingdom. In a 2014 referendum, voters opted to stay in the U.K., and attempts to secure a second plebiscite have been blocked by the U.K. government.Calm and measured, Sturgeon often seemed the antithesis of Johnson, especially during the coronavirus pandemic, when their contrasting communications and crisis-management styles were on display.Her profile went beyond Scotland. Donald Trump greeted her resignation as first minister in February with: \u201cGood riddance to failed woke extremist Nicola Sturgeon of Scotland!\u201dWHAT HAPPENED TO JOHNSON?Johnson\u2019s exit stems from the \u201cpartygate\u201d scandal over rule-breaking parties in government buildings during the pandemic. Johnson was one of scores of officials fined by police over the gatherings, though he denied deliberately breaking the rules his own government had imposed on the country.A standards committee has been investigating whether Johnson lied to Parliament over partygate. He quit Friday after seeing the committee\u2019s unpublished conclusions, slamming the panel of lawmakers as a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d that was determined to drive him from office. If the committee found that Johnson had lied, he would likely have faced suspension from Parliament and a petition by his constituents to oust him from seat in the House of Commons.The committee, which has a majority from Johnson's own Conservative Party, still plans to publish its findings, and though it can no longer suspend Johnson, it could impose other sanctions, such as removing his access to Parliament.WHAT ABOUT STURGEON?Sturgeon surprised many Scots when she stepped down as first minister in February, saying she knew \u201cin my head and in my heart\u201d it was time for her, her party and her country to make way for someone else.Since then, two former SNP executives \u2013 including Sturgeon\u2019s husband, Peter Murrell \u2013 have been arrested and questioned by police investigating what happened to more than 600,000 pounds ($754,000) designated for a future Scottish independence campaign.On Sunday, Sturgeon herself was arrested and questioned for more than six hours. She was released without charge as the police investigation continues.CAN EITHER OF THEM COME BACK?Johnson and Sturgeon both defiantly insist their careers aren\u2019t over.After being released by police, Sturgeon insisted she was \u201cinnocent of any wrongdoing\u201d and said she would continue as a lawmaker in the Scottish parliament.But opposition politicians called for her to be suspended \u2013 and some SNP legislators agreed. Ash Regan, who ran unsuccessfully to replace Sturgeon as party leader, said \u201cthe leadership \u2026 need to really think about taking decisive action\u201d if Sturgeon did not resign from the party.Johnson resigned from Parliament with a 1,000-word screed, accusing opponents of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and a \u201cpolitical hitjob.\u201d He said he was leaving \u201cat least for now.\u201dTim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, said Johnson probably hoped he could make a comeback, but that it would be \u201cvery difficult.\u201d\u201cI suspect that many Conservatives would quake at that prospect,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the majority of the party, quite frankly, would like to see the back of Boris Johnson now.\u201dIS THERE A MORAL TO THE STORY?If there is a lesson, it may be that dominant figures often leave chaos and division in their wake.The departures of Johnson and Sturgeon both triggered bitter party leadership contests. The SNP narrowly chose Humza Yousaf as the new first minister after a contest dominated by questions about Sturgeon\u2019s legacy. He is struggling to energize a party that is sagging in opinion polls and divided on the best way to push the cause of independence.The Conservatives initially picked staunch free-marketer Liz Truss to replace Johnson. She resigned six weeks into her term after her tax-cutting budget caused mayhem on financial markets and sent the value of the pound plunging. The party then installed Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, a technocrat who calmed the markets and restored a measure of stability.RecommendedJohnson accuses Sunak of \u2018talking rubbish\u2019 as rancour becomes slanging matchTax cuts without lower inflation is \u2018betrayal\u2019 of Thatcher, says ministerUxbridge, Mid-Bedfordshire and Selby by-elections: Key numbersBut Sunak still faces a fractious party that is trailing the Labour opposition in opinion polls.Michael Gove, a senior Cabinet minister under both Johnson and Sunak, said that while Johnson brought \u201ccolor and panache\u201d to British politics, Sunak is a better prime minister who is bringing \u201cprofessionalism and focus to government.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64875f3051ac331e85b9da70", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/nikki-sanderson-mirror-group-newspapers-high-court-itv-london-b2355981.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "I\u2019m not an object, Nikki Sanderson tells High Court in Mirror publisher claim", "lead": "The actress is suing Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) for damages over alleged unlawful information-gathering.", "author": "Jess Glass", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 13:50:11 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:48.362394", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/14/c088511dc3af1a9ddc58f41258880b38Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjYzODM3-2.72583716.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeActress Nikki Sanderson has told the High Court she is \u201cnot an object\u201d as part of her claim against the Mirror\u2019s publisher over alleged unlawful information-gathering.Former Coronation Street star Ms Sanderson, 39, is suing Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN) for damages, claiming journalists at its titles \u2013 The Daily and Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People \u2013 were linked to methods including phone hacking, so-called \u201cblagging\u201d or gaining information by deception, and use of private investigators for unlawful activities.Ms Sanderson, who played Candice Stowe in the ITV soap between 1999 and 2005, is set to finish her evidence on Monday afternoon after entering the witness box on Friday.The actress is bringing her claim in relation to 37 articles published in Mirror titles between 1999 and 2009.MGN has previously denied that 35 of the 37 articles involved phone hacking or unlawful information-gathering, with one article being not admitted.\n\nI'm not public property, I'm not a commodity, I'm not an object, I'm still a human. I have the right to choose what I'm doingNikki SandersonDuring the second day of her evidence, Ms Sanderson was taken through several of the articles by MGN\u2019s barrister, along with some examples of similar stories in non-MGN publications.One of these stories, a short piece in the Daily Mirror from May 2005, showed Ms Sanderson and her then-boyfriend Danny Young on a beach together, which MGN say came from a photography agency.Ms Sanderson described the photo as \u201cunflattering\u201d, adding: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand how they knew I was talking about going on holiday with my friends.\u201dThe actress, who has played Maxine Minniver in the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks since 2012, was then taken to a front-page photoshoot she starred in with the men\u2019s magazine Maxim in August 2005.Andrew Green KC, for MGN, noted that Ms Sanderson was in lingerie.Ms Sanderson replied: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen to do it, I\u2019ve got control on the day, I\u2019ve consented to it.\u201dThe barrister later said: \u201cYou took the view that this sort of article was good for your career.\u201d\u201cThis sort of article is something I consented to,\u201d the actress replied. \u201cI should have consent over my own life and own image, who I see.\u201dMs Sanderson later told the court that she is \u201cwithin my rights\u201d to make her choices.She continued: \u201cI\u2019m not public property, I\u2019m not a commodity, I\u2019m not an object, I\u2019m still a human. I have the right to choose what I\u2019m doing.\u201dMs Sanderson added that having done interviews and photoshoots \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean that the illegal activity against me is okay\u201d.The court later heard that one of the articles described Ms Sanderson as having an argument near the Coronation Street set.Mr Green said: \u201cIt says you were fuming \u2026 there is a reference to an onlooker.\u201cThis appears to be reporting something someone had seen rather than being gathered from voicemail messages.\u201dHowever, Ms Sanderson said she would not have had a row outside of the set, where she could be seen by the public.She added: \u201cI just don\u2019t feel like that would have happened.\u201dThe actress later denied a suggestion that another article was \u201cutterly trivial\u201d.\u201cTo you it might seem trivial, to me it\u2019s like I was being watched and followed,\u201d she said.In a witness statement prepared for the trial, Ms Sanderson said that MGN journalists \u201cabused\u201d her when she was a \u201cchild\u201d.Questioned about this on Monday, Ms Sanderson said this related to \u201cthe abuse of power towards me as a child\u201d.In its trial defence, the publisher says Ms Sanderson\u2019s claim is brought too late but \u201cunreservedly apologises\u201d over four payments made to private investigators which it admits are evidence of instructions to unlawfully obtain her private information.Mr Green told the court on Friday that the evidence in Ms Sanderson\u2019s case is \u201cweak\u201d and the publisher does \u201cnot accept that it establishes a case of voicemail interception\u201d and does not show \u201csystemic hacking\u201d of her phone.Ms Sanderson\u2019s case is one of four representative claims being heard in London, alongside similar claims brought by the Duke of Sussex, Coronation Street actor Michael Turner, known professionally as Michael Le Vell, and comedian Paul Whitehouse\u2019s ex-wife Fiona Wightman."}, {"_id": "64875f3051ac331e85b9da71", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/nhs-london-british-england-caribbean-b2355975.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Mural celebrates black blood donors as NHS calls for more in sickle cell fight", "lead": "Artist Neequaye Dreph\u2019s mural honours members of the black community who donate blood regularly, and encourages others to do the same.", "author": "Sarah Ping", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 13:24:11 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:48.762202", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/14/12134051-5b83c0d6-521b-42b4-bc54-f347c890f602.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

But I want to keep pushing it to our community how important it is for us to give blood.\u201cIt\u2019s so sad that so many people turn away from giving blood, and what we need to do is educate them, change the mindset of those out there.\u201dNaim Akhtar, consultant haematologist and lead in donor medicine for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \u201cMany sickle cell patients need regular blood transfusions to prevent life-threatening complications, but currently we are only able to provide ethnically matched blood for around half of the hospital requests \u2013 leaving other sickle cell patients at risk of developing serious reactions to non-ethnically matched blood.RecommendedTax cuts without lower inflation is \u2018betrayal\u2019 of Thatcher, says ministerFirefighters continue to tackle raging wildfire in HighlandsMan appears in court charged with murdering Chloe Mitchell\u201cWhile we are delighted to celebrate members of the black community who regularly step forward to give lifesaving blood, demand is increasing rapidly and we urgently need more people of black heritage to come forward.\u201dThe mural will be on display to the public throughout National Blood Week which runs from June 12 until June 18."}, {"_id": "64875f3151ac331e85b9da72", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rishi-sunak-government-english-channel-stephen-kinnock-home-affairs-select-committee-b2355951.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Channel crossings reach highest daily total in 2023 so far", "lead": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has made tackling small boat crossings a priority for his Government this year.", "author": "Ian Jones", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 13:14:10 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:49.000845", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/14/9cdbef4d805a6d4a1573bce2cca070aaY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjUxMDky-2.72501322.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Get the free Morning Headlines email for news from our reporters across the worldSign up to our free Morning Headlines email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMore than 600 migrants have crossed the English Channel in a new daily record this year, days after Rishi Sunak claimed his plan to \u201cstop the boats\u201d was working.Figures released by the Home Office show that 616 people arrived in 12 boats on Sunday, bringing the total so far this year to around 8,400.At the same point last year, the total had just passed 10,000, and last Monday the prime minister hailed the reduction as proof that \u201cour approach is working\u201d.But Border Force sources told The Independent crossings had been suppressed by weeks of rough seas in the Channel, and experts said much of the reduction had resulted from a drop in Albanian migrants rather than an overall change.Afghans are now the most common nationality arriving in small boats, following the collapse in the number of refugees resettled directly from the country following the Taliban\u2019s takeover in 2021.RecommendedSmall boats bill \u2018could lead to more dangerous routes and increase trafficking\u2019Sunak says \u2018stop the boats\u2019 plan is \u2018starting to work\u2019 as he announces two new bargesSunak challenged on timing of small boats speech as crossings drop during strong windsThere were no recorded small boat crossings between 28 May and Saturday, when 154 people made the journey as winds dropped and the sea calmed for the first time in a fortnight.Last Monday, the prime minister hailed progress on his pledge to \u201cstop the boats\u201d, saying that the drop in overall numbers by that point showed \u201cour approach is working\u201d.\u201cThis won\u2019t be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it\u2019s so important that we change the law,\u201d he added. \u201cI said I would stop the boats and I meant it.\u201dStephen Kinnock, Labour\u2019s shadow immigration minister, said Mr Sunak needed to \u201cstop the boast and start stopping the boats\u201d.\u201cThe prime minister got over excited and declared victory in 'stopping the boats' - despite 10,000 asylum seekers crossing the Channel this year,\u201d he added.\u201cWith the weather improving and the number of crossings increasing, Rishi Sunak needs to roll up his sleeves and start doing the hard graft, rather than ploughing on with the headline-chasing, government-by-gimmick approach which landed him in this mess in the first place.\u201dRishi Sunak says he 'will not rest' until small boats are stoppedIn response to the figures, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson claimed crossings \u201cfluctuate on any given day\u201d and Mr Sunak had been speaking about a five-month average.\u201cThe enhanced work with our French counterparts means that you are now more likely to be intercepted and stopped if you attempt to make a crossing than succeed in crossing the Channel,\u201d he added on Monday.\u201cBut, clearly, crossings are continuing and that is because we have not been able to put in place our full plans, and obviously there is a great deal of work across government to that end.\u201dBut on the same day, Home Office submissions to the Court of Appeal said its \u201coperational plans are based on scenarios of up to 56,000 small boat arrivals in 2023\u201d, which would be a new record and a rise of over a fifth on 2022.The disclosure was made as part of an ongoing legal battle over Suella Braverman\u2019s attempt to transform former military bases into asylum accommodation, using a planning bypass for \u201cemergencies\u201d.Experts had cautioned that it was \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether small boat crossings were on course for an overall reduction this year, and if government policy or other factors were behind any changes.Dr Peter William Walsh, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said periods of calm weather over the summer would be the \u201cmain test\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know the extent to which the decline is driven by a fall in Albanian arrivals,\u201d he added.\u201cIt could be that the government\u2019s deterrent policy is having an effect, but it is currently not possible to disentangle the government\u2019s policy changes from the range of other factors that influence irregular arrivals.\u201d (Data: Home Office)Lucy Moreton, of the ISU union which represents Border Force staff, said there was \u201csome evidence that the French are becoming much more effective in deterring crossings\u201d. \u201cThere are also an increased number of attempts being aborted and returning to French soil when a vessel has failed,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, crossings are continuing and planning continues to anticipate a similar number to last year.\u201dThe government has claimed that its new Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to see all small boat migrants detained and deported without consideration of asylum or trafficking claims, will deter crossings.But a parliamentary report published on Sunday said the provisions could lead to asylum seekers taking \u201cmore dangerous routes\u201d to the UK, benefit people smugglers and worsen trafficking.An inquiry by the cross-party joint committee on human rights said the government had not provided any evidence backing claims the bill would deter Channel crossings, and that many of its provisions were unlawful.The government has not yet published an official assessment for the law, which has already been approved by the House of Commons and is being considered by the Lords.During a debate last week, peers accused ministers of pressuring them to pass laws that have \u201cno practical operability\u201d because the UK has insufficient detention capacity to hold all small boat migrants and returns agreements with only two countries.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate

But the interest was real and caused you to experiment in a way that was highly dangerous.\u201dThe court had heard how Bhatti was reported to police by the owner of a computer repair shop who became suspicious of the content on his laptop.An analysis of the computer and other electronic devices seized by police revealed a library of materials on how to manufacture explosive devices.A search of the defendant\u2019s home and a rented storage unit uncovered precursor chemicals and circuitry for the construction of explosive devices.Experts also identified an improvised explosive device and three quantities of an improvised explosive known as black powder.\n\nThis case is a perfect example of how important it is that the people within our communities, the people who know it best, are confident to report anything suspicious into usDetective Chief Superintendent Olly WrightThe prosecution alleged Bhatti had the explosives for \u201ca purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism\u201d.An examination of Bhatti\u2019s computer also revealed a 173-page document compiled by the defendant entitled The Mu\u2019min\u2019s Handbook.Although unfinished, its contents page included sections on Islam, jihad and martyrdom followed by chapters on \u201ca simple guide to explosives\u201d, \u201chand-to-hand combat\u201d and \u201chandguns and sniper rifles\u201d.The 20th chapter entitled The Munaafiqun (The Hypocrites) identified a perceived worldwide \u201cenemy\u201d to Islam and its \u201ctrue adherents\u201d.He wrote that the \u201cevil human beings\u201d included \u201ccorrupt heads of Governments, Black Magicians, Religious Scholars\u201d.When asked in police interview to explain the content, Bhatti said it was \u201cjust like educational documents, work documents, just like hobby documents, stuff that interests me\u201d.Bhatti explained that he had studied engineering and business management at the University of Greenwich, and that he was a part-qualified accountant working as a senior financial analyst.Giving evidence at his trial, Bhatti claimed he had the materials for lawful experimentation and out of curiosity.In March, a jury rejected his explanation and found him guilty of two counts of possessing explosives, making explosives and two counts of possessing articles for terrorist purposes on or before January 8 2021.In mitigation, Edward Henry KC told the court that Bhatti was \u201csad\u201d rather than \u201cbad\u201d and had not sought to share his writings with others.Mr Henry said: \u201cHe wanted to reduce the world to pure reason, a reason of his own understanding.\u201dDetective Chief Superintendent Olly Wright, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East , said: \u201cThis case is a perfect example of how important it is that the people within our communities, the people who know it best, are confident to report anything suspicious into us.\u201cThankfully, due to the vigilance of a member of the public, Bhatti\u2019s actions were investigated, and he was stopped from causing harm. We will never fully know what the consequences could have been.\u201cI would like to take this opportunity to thank anyone who either has or will come forward with information, whether this leads to an investigation on this scale or not, your report will help us to keep our communities safe.\u201dDetective Inspector Alex Maguire, Borough Commander of Reigate and Banstead, said: \u201cThis sentence reaffirms our commitment, alongside our partners in Counter Terrorism Policing South East, to root out those with extremist views and bring them to justice.\u201cWhile he evidently had the intent to equip himself with harmful substances, he was stopped and those devices were not deemed functional and he has now been bought to justice.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64875f3151ac331e85b9da75", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/staffordshire-stoke-double-murder-boy-girl-b2355879.html", "primaryCategory": "Crime", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Girl, 7, and boy, 11, dead after reports of stabbing as woman arrested on suspicion of murder", "lead": "<p>Children were found with \u2018significant injuries\u2019, police say </p>", "author": "Maryam Zakir-Hussain", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 12:52:25 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:49.578835", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/12/flax%20street.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Polls currently suggest Sir Keir could become prime minister next year, but Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d's warning means he would have to wait if he wanted to change the terms of trade.But many problems caused by the looser trade arrangements would be difficult to overcome outside the single market and customs union, which Sir Keir has explicitly ruled out rejoining.Make UK, which represents British manufacturers, say the threadbare nature of the deal compared to membership of the single market has \u201cramped up costs, caused import and export delays, and is hampering smooth trade\u201d.One of the most recent warnings comes from Stellantis, parent company of Vauxhall, Citroen, Fiat and Peugeot, which says so-called \u201crules of origin\u201d, which apply now Britain is outside the EU, are making business difficult.In a submission to a parliamentary committee inquiry, it said the current arrangements were \u201ca threat to our export business and the sustainability of our UK manufacturing operations\u201d.In his speech on Monday, Mr \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said: \u201cThe [Brexit trade agreement] offers significant potential to further improve our partnership.

A as he is facing further court proceedings.Father A socialised with the Bishop, spent time at his official residence both during the day and overnight and visited the private quarters of St Mary\u2019s Cathedral.Bishop Byrne, 66, asked for permission for Father A to live with him as he felt \u201cisolated\u201d living in the Bishop\u2019s House, the report stated.The report said Bishop Byrne tried to get a job for Father A within the diocese working on its archives, but a safeguarding officer refused the appointment as that would give Father A access to sensitive files.And Bishop Byrne tried to get Father A work with an overseas charity which works with vulnerable people, giving few details of his friend\u2019s offending history and saying that he was subject to sex offenders\u2019 register requirements for only a few more months.The charity refused to appoint him.Bishop Byrne also ignored safeguarding issues about Canon Michael McCoy, whom he promoted to be cathedral dean, despite there being concerns about his behaviour dating back to 1996, the report said.The concerns included him offering young people foreign holidays and providing them with alcohol despite them being underage.Former lay employees and clergy gave clear accounts that Bishop Byrne was notified about Fr McCoy\u2019s \u201csignificant history\u201d, including an \u201cin-person\u201d hand-over from his predecessor in 2019.Nevertheless, Bishop Byrne indicated he wanted to go ahead with the appointment.The report said it could not say whether Fr McCoy committed offences, but he \u201cdisplayed a clear pattern of grooming behaviour over the years\u201d.He killed himself after Northumbria Police informed him that an investigation into historic abuse allegations was to begin.The CSSA report conclusion stated: \u201cOur review has identified a number of serious failures of leadership which have undermined the work of safeguarding professionals and left people at potential risk.\u201cUltimately, a failure of leadership means a failure of safeguarding.\u201dLast month, an official investigation ordered by Archbishop Malcolm McMahon found that Bishop Byrne had made a series of \u201cerrors of judgment\u201d.\n\nIt raises a much wider issue for the Catholic church which is the unlimited and unaccountable power of bishopsRichard Scorer, lawyer Lawyer Richard Scorer of Slater and Gordon, who has acted for many survivors of clerical sex abuse in the Catholic church, said: \u201cThis is a damning report which exposes multiple failings in the diocese.\u201cHowever, it raises a much wider issue for the Catholic church which is the unlimited and unaccountable power of bishops.\u201cIn the Catholic Church\u2019s medieval structure, the bishop is king in his own diocese and can ignore and ride roughshod over the advice of safeguarding advisors.\u201cWhenever we see scandals in the Catholic church, we typically find that a bishop has abused his power.\u201cUnless and until the Catholic church, nationally and internationally, radically reforms its structures to ensure that bishops are properly accountable, these kinds of scandals will continue to happen.\u201dRecommendedFirefighters continue to tackle raging wildfire in HighlandsMan appears in court charged with murdering Chloe MitchellGirl, seven, and boy, 11, dead in suspected

and support, safety and protection to survivors.\u201cTogether, we are committed to a safer safeguarding practice.\u201d"}, {"_id": "64875f3251ac331e85b9da7a", "url":

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeOne of Scotland\u2019s leading doctors has said she did not sign off on plans for a children\u2019s ward, telling an inquiry they were promised a like-for-like unit they never got.Professor Brenda Gibson, a consultant paediatric haematologist, gave evidence to the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry on Monday, which is investigating a series of contamination issues at the \u00a3840 million Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow.Scottish ministers announced the inquiry in the wake of deaths linked to infections at the hospital, including that of 10-year-old Millie Main, who was being treated for cancer at the children\u2019s hospital that is part of the same campus.The inquiry is also examining problems that led to the delay in the opening of the new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh.Professor Gibson told Alister Duncan KC, the inquiry\u2019s senior counsel, that she she did not sign off on plans because they had not got the hospital they were promised.RecommendedCharity boss speaks out over \u2018traumatic\u2019 encounter with royal aideUkraine war\u2019s heaviest fight rages in east - follow liveThe professor, lead of the Schiehallion children\u2019s cancer unit, told the \u00a311 million inquiry that the responsibility for providing a safe environment for patients lies with the health board.The unit had been based at Yorkhill in the city, and plans were drawn up for it to be moved. Prof Gibson said there had been \u201cvery limited consultation\u201d.\u201cAll that I remember we had as choices was there was a floor plan, and that was to be our space, and we were not to have any more space than that,\u201d the inquiry heard.\n\nWe had been promised a like-for-like unit in a flagship hospital and it certainly wasn't a like-for-like unitProfessor Brenda Gibson\u201cWe could do anything related to that space, but if it didn\u2019t meet our needs, it couldn\u2019t be extended. So we just had to make the most of that space and we opted to maximise the number of patient cubicles.\u201dIt meant at the new hospital, she told the inquiry, they had to \u201csacrifice\u201d much of what had been at the old unit in order to fit patients to avoid them being sent to other wards and, as a result lost office space, parent accommodation, a staff room, a seminar room, and pharmacy accommodation.\u201cI, as the lead, was asked to sign off the plan and I didn\u2019t do it. Well, I didn\u2019t do it to the best of my knowledge. I certainly held out for a very long time,\u201d she said.\u201cI think it was signed off by a senior nurse, a managerial nurse. That\u2019s my understanding.\u201dAnd, the inquiry heard: \u201cWe had been promised a like-for-like unit in a flagship hospital and it certainly wasn\u2019t a like-for-like unit.\u201dContamination issues have been linked with water quality and ventilation systems in the super-hospital, which opened in April 2015.Prof Gibson told the hearing, which is being overseen by inquiry chairman Lord Brodie, she had no involvement with ventilation or water systems, and their involvement was \u201cpurely in deciding how we would allocate the space\u201d.During the hearing, Prof Gibson said it was the view of clinicians that they were \u201cresponsible for providing chemotherapy or any other form of care within national or international protocols or guidelines, and to do that with a well-trained workforce within a holistic manner\u201d.She added: \u201cThe responsibility for providing a safe environment for that treatment to be delivered lies, within our view, with the health board led by the chief executive.\u201cThe responsibility for deciding is a place safe or not safe, lies with control of infection.\u201dUpon moving into the hospital, the inquiry heard, there were sewage leaks, cladding issues, and windows falling out.The inquiry also heard there were issues with temperature, blinds, televisions not working, and also issues with the smell of a nearby sewage treatment works.RecommendedFirefighters continue to tackle raging wildfire in HighlandsMan appears in court charged with murdering Chloe MitchellGirl, seven, and boy, 11, dead in suspected double murderProf Gibson is the lead clinician for the haematology and oncology service based in the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow.The inquiry continues."}, {"_id": "64875f3251ac331e85b9da7b", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/met-office-midlands-scotland-wales-northern-ireland-b2355955.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Flood alerts as thunderstorms forecast across country", "lead": "The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms and rain from 12pm to 9pm on Monday.", "author": "Flora Bowen", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 12:19:49 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:50.649090", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/14/2cd9496cb4d2ff71cd79d706637647edY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjU4MzM1-2.72565953.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Are people prepared? Make sure mobile phones are charged and that sort of thing.\u201cBecause when you get these storms they can change your circumstances quite dramatically within almost a matter of minutes.\u201dMr Madge said that heat rising from freshly ploughed fields or over a city area could trigger thunderstorms even when nearby areas remain dry.Flash flooding can occur in a few minutes, caused by these highly localised weather conditions.Urban areas with lots of concrete can be vulnerable to flash flooding as the rain hits surfaces such as pavements which cannot absorb heavy downpours, leaving them to flow into drains or roads.Underpasses can also fill quickly and drivers could face hazards with flood water on roads.Higher temperatures are concentrated in the north today, with Manchester, Leeds, and Keswick, Cumbria, between 30 and 31C, while south-central England remains in the high 20s, with London and Cambridge both reaching between 27 and 28C.Further thunderstorms may be possible in the first half of the week, with fresher conditions and temperatures slightly decreasing towards Thursday and Friday.RecommendedFirefighters continue to tackle raging wildfire in HighlandsMan appears in court charged with murdering Chloe MitchellGirl, seven, and boy, 11, dead in suspected double murderHowever, the sunny weather is staying with most parts of the country forecast to remain above 24 and 25C throughout the week, and temperatures potentially reaching 29C in Bristol and Birmingham over Wednesday and Thursday.Cooler air from the North Sea will reach parts of the UK on Thursday and Friday, particularly areas along the North Sea coast and the East of England."}, {"_id": "64875f3351ac331e85b9da7c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/france-bbc-british-celeste-brittany-b2355992.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Schoolgirl from British family shot dead in France \u2013 reports", "lead": "The 11-year-old was reportedly killed while playing on her garden swing.", "author": "Joseph Draper", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 14:10:22 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:51.129768", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/15/12150834-9a2d5a5b-aa05-4144-82d0-bee3d444947d.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

I didn\u2019t think it was right and if people don\u2019t like that, then tough.\u201dMr Sunak said he had vowed to \u201cdo things differently\u201d when he entered No 10, adding: \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201dThere have been claims that Mr Johnson reached a \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d with Mr Sunak that he would wave through the honours list and allow the MPs to be re-vetted by Holac at a later date so they would not have to stand down now.One Downing Street source said the Cabinet Office had made it clear to Mr Johnson that there is no re-vetting process.But Mr Johnson\u2019s camp has accused his successor of breaking the deal that has now enflamed tensions rather than buying a ceasefire in the hostilities.An ally told the PA news agency: \u201cRishi secretly blocked the peerages for Nadine and others.\u201cHe refused to ask for them to undergo basic checks that could have taken only a few weeks or even days.\u201cThat is how he kept them off the list \u2013 without telling Boris Johnson.\u201dThe Prime Minister\u2019s official spokesman said it is \u201centirely untrue to say that anyone from No 10 attempted to remove or change\u201d the list approved by Holac, understand to have been finalised in February.The body, which Mr Johnson himself overruled while in No 10 over the peerage of Tory donor Peter Cruddas, has confirmed it did not support eight nominees put forward by the ex-leader.Government figures have insisted that neither Mr Sunak nor Downing Street removed names from Mr Johnson\u2019s peerages submission.Cabinet minister Michael Gove stressed on Monday that the \u201cappropriate procedure\u201d and the correct \u201cprecedent\u201d was followed.Downing Street took the decision on Saturday to declassify Holac chairman Lord Bew\u2019s approved names to Mr Sunak.The letter, dated February 5, contains the seven peerages announced on Friday, along with a redacted name of a person who took the \u201cpersonal decision to withdraw themselves\u201d.The Privileges Committee will meet on Monday to finalise and discuss the publication of its report into Mr Johnson, who has dismissed the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d.The probe is thought to have ruled that Mr Johnson lied to Parliament when he told MPs Covid rules were followed in Downing Street despite boozy parties taking place while social distancing restrictions were in place.Reports suggest the panel was set to recommend at least a 10-day suspension, reaching the threshold for a by-election to be potentially triggered in Mr Johnson\u2019s west London seat.RecommendedFirefighters continue to tackle raging wildfire in HighlandsMan appears in court charged with murdering Chloe MitchellGirl, seven, and boy, 11, dead in suspected double murderMr Johnson accused the committee of \u201cbias\u201d and likened it to a \u201ckangaroo court\u201d.The resigning MPs are yet to formally trigger their exit from the Commons under the archaic process of being appointed to be the Steward and Bailiffs of the Chiltern Hundreds or of the Manor of Northstead."}, {"_id": "64875f3351ac331e85b9da7e", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/charles-the-king-flying-scotsman-church-flying-b2355959.html", "primaryCategory": "UK", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Charles takes to footplate of Flying Scotsman on North Yorkshire Moors visit", "lead": "The King went on an extended walkabout in Pickering after arriving in the market town on the Royal Train.", "author": "Dave Higgens", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 11:47:40 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:51.498765", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/12/14/85124260a287c7bf19bbcc0a2f91697fY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NjU0ODQx-2.72582138.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emailsSign up to our free breaking news emails\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMore than 600 migrants have crossed the English Channel in a new daily record this year, days after Rishi Sunak claimed his plan to \u201cstop the boats\u201d was working.Figures released by the Home Office show that 616 people arrived in 12 boats on Sunday, bringing the total so far this year to around 8,400.At the same point last year, the total had just passed 10,000, and last Monday the prime minister hailed the reduction as proof that \u201cour approach is working\u201d.But Border Force sources told The Independent crossings had been suppressed by weeks of rough seas in the Channel, and experts said much of the reduction had resulted from a drop in Albanian migrants rather than an overall change.Afghans are now the most common nationality arriving in small boats, following the collapse in the number of refugees resettled directly from the country following the Taliban\u2019s takeover in 2021.RecommendedSmall boats bill \u2018could lead to more dangerous routes and increase trafficking\u2019Sunak says \u2018stop the boats\u2019 plan is \u2018starting to work\u2019 as he announces two new bargesSunak challenged on timing of small boats speech as crossings drop during strong windsThere were no recorded small boat crossings between 28 May and Saturday, when 154 people made the journey as winds dropped and the sea calmed for the first time in a fortnight.Last Monday, the prime minister hailed progress on his pledge to \u201cstop the boats\u201d, saying that the drop in overall numbers by that point showed \u201cour approach is working\u201d.\u201cThis won\u2019t be solved overnight, and people will continue to come this summer, which is why it\u2019s so important that we change the law,\u201d he added. \u201cI said I would stop the boats and I meant it.\u201dStephen Kinnock, Labour\u2019s shadow immigration minister, said Mr Sunak needed to \u201cstop the boast and start stopping the boats\u201d.\u201cThe prime minister got over excited and declared victory in 'stopping the boats' - despite 10,000 asylum seekers crossing the Channel this year,\u201d he added.\u201cWith the weather improving and the number of crossings increasing, Rishi Sunak needs to roll up his sleeves and start doing the hard graft, rather than ploughing on with the headline-chasing, government-by-gimmick approach which landed him in this mess in the first place.\u201dRishi Sunak says he 'will not rest' until small boats are stoppedIn response to the figures, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson claimed crossings \u201cfluctuate on any given day\u201d and Mr Sunak had been speaking about a five-month average.\u201cThe enhanced work with our French counterparts means that you are now more likely to be intercepted and stopped if you attempt to make a crossing than succeed in crossing the Channel,\u201d he added on Monday.\u201cBut, clearly, crossings are continuing and that is because we have not been able to put in place our full plans, and obviously there is a great deal of work across government to that end.\u201dBut on the same day, Home Office submissions to the Court of Appeal said its \u201coperational plans are based on scenarios of up to 56,000 small boat arrivals in 2023\u201d, which would be a new record and a rise of over a fifth on 2022.The disclosure was made as part of an ongoing legal battle over Suella Braverman\u2019s attempt to transform former military bases into asylum accommodation, using a planning bypass for \u201cemergencies\u201d.Experts had cautioned that it was \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether small boat crossings were on course for an overall reduction this year, and if government policy or other factors were behind any changes.Dr Peter William Walsh, senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said periods of calm weather over the summer would be the \u201cmain test\u201d.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know the extent to which the decline is driven by a fall in Albanian arrivals,\u201d he added.\u201cIt could be that the government\u2019s deterrent policy is having an effect, but it is currently not possible to disentangle the government\u2019s policy changes from the range of other factors that influence irregular arrivals.\u201d (Data: Home Office)Lucy Moreton, of the ISU union which represents Border Force staff, said there was \u201csome evidence that the French are becoming much more effective in deterring crossings\u201d. \u201cThere are also an increased number of attempts being aborted and returning to French soil when a vessel has failed,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, crossings are continuing and planning continues to anticipate a similar number to last year.\u201dThe government has claimed that its new Illegal Migration Bill, which aims to see all small boat migrants detained and deported without consideration of asylum or trafficking claims, will deter crossings.But a parliamentary report published on Sunday said the provisions could lead to asylum seekers taking \u201cmore dangerous routes\u201d to the UK, benefit people smugglers and worsen trafficking.An inquiry by the cross-party joint committee on human rights said the government had not provided any evidence backing claims the bill would deter Channel crossings, and that many of its provisions were unlawful.The government has not yet published an official assessment for the law, which has already been approved by the House of Commons and is being considered by the Lords.During a debate last week, peers accused ministers of pressuring them to pass laws that have \u201cno practical operability\u201d because the UK has insufficient detention capacity to hold all small boat migrants and returns agreements with only two countries.RecommendedBudget 2022: Hunt says UK in recession as he announces huge tax risesJeremy Hunt increases energy windfall tax in budgetJeremy Hunt freezes tax allowances and hits 45p rate

Beginning her career by specialising in obstetrics, gynaecology and anaesthetics, she subsequently became a GP.She met her future husband Gerald Patrick McCann in 1993 and they married in 1998. Madeleine, their eldest child, was born in 2003 and the couple had twins, Amelia and Sean, in 2005.Mr McCann was born in Glasgow in 1968 and attended Holyrood RC Secondary School before graduating from the University of Glasgow with a bachelor of science degree in physiology and sports science in 1989.He obtained his medical doctorate from the same institution in 2002 and has worked as a consultant cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, since 2005, with the family setting up home in Rothley, Leicestershire.The couple are still waiting for answers to explain what happened to their daughter  (PA)After Madeleine\u2019s disappearance from the family\u2019s rented apartment complex \u2013 while her parents and a group of friends ate dinner at an open-air tapas restaurant, a member of the party checking on the otherwise-unattended children every half-hour \u2013 the McCanns led the public appeals for information and became fixtures on newspaper front pages and television screens. They were also subjected to lurid tabloid allegations suggesting that they and their friends might be swingers or, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children. Others claimed to have spotted inconsistencies in their account of the night\u2019s events, insinuating that they might have been involved in their daughter\u2019s disappearance.The intensity of the hostility towards the McCanns would later be described by Roy Greenslade of The Guardian as \u201cno journalistic accident\u201d and \u201ca sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\u201d.The couple were interviewed as \u201carguidos\u201d (suspects) by the Portuguese authorities in September 2007, with the parents told that police dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car. They vehemently denied the accusations against them and subsequently launched a libel action against one of the detectives who had gone on to write a book about the case.Madeleine McCann\u2019s mystery disappearance has fascinated the public for years  (PA)After the family returned to England, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report alleging that Madeleine had died in the holiday apartment as a result of an accident (rather than been abducted by a stranger), that the tapas dinner and rota checks had been part of a planned cover-up, that the family\u2019s friends had helped to mislead the police and that the McCanns had concealed her body and then faked a kidnapping.That official suspicion lingered until July 2008 when Portugal\u2019s attorney general, Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link either the McCanns or another suspect, local man Robert Murat, to the disappearance after all and closed the case unsolved.The McCanns refused to give up, issuing computer-generated images of how their daughter might look with the advancing years, publishing their own book, entitled simply Madeleine (2011), and endorsing a successful campaign to pressure then-prime minister David Cameron into reopening the case. He did so.The result was Operation Grange, which saw officers return to Portugal in 2014 and investigate tens of thousands of documents at great expense, without definitively establishing the truth, causing the case to lie dormant for several years until Brueckner emerged as a new suspect in 2020.Portuguese police investigators dismantle base camp at the end of the three-day search for remains of Madeleine  (Getty)Writing in Madeleine, Kate McCann discussed the toll the ordeal had taken on her devout Roman Catholic faith, stating: \u201cThere have been many times when I\u2019ve felt God has deserted me or that He has let Madeleine down. I\u2019ve occasionally doubted His existence altogether. And yes, I\u2019ve been angry with Him.\u201cFor now, though, at least, my anger towards God seems to have subsided.

Obviously massive events like this cause a lot of reaction, a lot of trauma and upset. But ultimately you have to keep going \u2013 and especially when you have got other children involved.\u201cSome of that is subconscious I think \u2013 your mind and body just take over to a certain extent. But if you can\u2019t change something immediately, you have to go with it and do the best that you can.\u201dThe couple also addressed the online abuse they have received, commenting: \u201cI\u2019m sure it is a very small minority of people who spend their time doing it, but it has totally inhibited what we do.\u201cPersonally, we don\u2019t use social media, although we have used it in Madeleine\u2019s campaign.RecommendedHow much has the Madeleine McCann investigation cost?What happened to Madeleine McCann?

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeMadeleine McCann, a three-year-old girl from Rothley, Leicestershire, was reported missing from the Portuguese holiday resort of Praia da Luz on the Algarve on 3 May 2007, a case still unsolved and still the subject of intense interest among the public and press.Her parents, Kate McCann and Gerry McCann, posted a statement on the Find Madeleine website on 3 May 2023 marking the latest anniversary of their daughter\u2019s disappearance, reiterating their hopes of being reunited with her one day and posting a poem, \u201cThe Contradiction\u201d by Clare Pollard, to express their feelings.\u201cToday marks the 16th anniversary of Madeleine\u2019s abduction. Still missing... still very much missed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe police investigation continues, and we await a breakthrough. Thank you to everyone for your support \u2013 it really helps.\u201dFollow all the latest updates on The Independent\u2019s liveblogHere is a reminder of the events of the case.RecommendedMadeleine McCann news \u2013 latest: Soil from reservoir compared to samples from prime suspect\u2019s vanHow Madeleine McCann search at reservoir unfolded \u2013 and what police foundRead Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner\u2019s bombshell prison letters for the first timeThe story began when the McCanns \u2013 affluent doctors Kate and Gerry, their three-year-old daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin siblings Amelia and Sean \u2013 joined a group of seven family friends and their five children on holiday at the Ocean Club in the village of Praia da Luz on the southwestern tip of Portugal on 28 April 2007.After a pleasant spring break by the sea, the adults in the party went out for dinner at the resort\u2019s open-air tapas bar on 3 May, gathering at 8.30pm. The children were left behind sleeping in their respective apartments with the doors unlocked and a rota system in place among the parents to ensure that someone returned every half-hour to check on them.When Kate McCann took her turn and returned to her apartment at 10pm, she raced back to the restaurant screaming \u201cMadeleine\u2019s gone! Someone\u2019s taken her!\u201d The police were quickly called and 60 staff and fellow guests searched the complex, calling out the girl\u2019s name in vain until daybreak the following morning.Border police and airport staff were put on alert and hundreds of volunteers joined the efforts to find the missing girl over the coming days, the case fast becoming a sensation.The Portuguese authorities would later attract criticism over their conduct in the crucial earliest hours of the investigation when the trail might still have been warm, accused of making rudimentary mistakes like failing to conduct a house-by-house search of every local residence or interview all of the other guests at the resort, acting slowly to erect roadblocks and potentially compromising forensic evidence at the crime scene.Madeleine McCann (PA)The police initially stated that they believed Madeleine was still alive and had been abducted from the room by a stranger as the parents described their \u201canguish and despair\u201d over her vanishing, a worst fear realised for any parent.On 26 May, police issued a description of a suspicious man seen on the night of the girl\u2019s disappearance. The individual in question was spotted by Jane Tanner, one of the McCanns\u2019 dining companions, who said she had seen a Mediterranean man with dark hair and beige trousers carrying a child close to the apartment when she went to check in on her own children. Scotland Yard would later come to dismiss the sighting as a red herring.The search continued as the summer progressed amid a wild media circus and with huge fundraising activities underway, the McCanns setting up Madeleine\u2019s Fund on 15 May to raise cash to support further investigation and keep the profile of the case high, attracting generous donations from celebrities like Richard Branson, Simon Cowell, JK Rowling and Coleen Rooney. By 30 May, the case was such a cause celebre that they were being flown out to meet the Pope at the Vatican in Sir Phillip Green\u2019s Learjet.A local man, Robert Murat, subsequently became its first suspect and had his house and car searched, his swimming pool drained and his electronic devices confiscated but no evidence was found to link him to Madeleine and the matter was soon dropped.By June, the Portuguese police admitted that they had failed to protect potentially useful evidence at the scene as frustration with the lack of developments grew and the media began to question whether the McCanns themselves had been involved in the matter. Lurid tabloid allegations suggested the couple and their friends might have been swingers and that the McCanns, as physicians, might have been in the habit of sedating their children, while others claimed inconsistencies in their version of events.The intensity of the hostility towards the parents would later be described by Roy Greenslade of The Guardian as \u201cno journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\u201d, singling out The Daily Express and Daily Star for particular condemnation.In July, assistance offered by former South African police officer Danie Krugel \u2013 who claimed his handheld \u201cmatter orientation system\u201d could help to find Madeleine \u2013 was rubbished, while British police sent over two springer spaniel sniffer dogs to search for DNA. Gerry and Kate McCann (PA)Relations with the local authorities would ultimately sour as the latter came to resent British intrusion into a Portuguese inquiry, according to Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan\u2019s book Looking for Madeleine (2014).By August, Madeleine has been missing for 100 days and police admitted for the first time that she may never be found. They also told the McCanns that they were no longer considering the matter an abduction case but, rather, a murder inquiry.The McCanns themselves were interviewed as \u201carguidos\u201d (suspects) by Portuguese police in September, with the parents told that the dogs had discovered DNA evidence from the missing girl in the boot of their holiday rental car, lines of inquiry that had already been leaked to the British press. They vehemently denied having any part in her disappearance.Despite being listed as suspects (a designation that would linger until the following July), the McCanns were allowed to return to Britain on 9 September. A day later, chief inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Policia Judiciaria in Portimao signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine McCann had died in their apartment as a result of an accident, that the tapas dinner and rota checks on the McCann children had been part of a planned cover-up, that the family\u2019s friends had helped to mislead the police and that the McCanns had concealed the body and then faked an abduction. A public prosecutor subsequently applied for the confiscation of Kate McCann\u2019s diary and Gerry McCann\u2019s laptop plus the group\u2019s phone records.On 2 October, chief inspector Goncalo Amaral was removed from the case and transferred after alleging that the British police were only interested in pursuing leads favourable to the McCanns. He would later publish a book, Maddie: The Truth of the Lie, the following summer, resulting in a lengthy libel battle with the McCanns that would run back and forth through the courts until March 2017.Back in Britain, Gerry McCann issued a video that November in which he speculated that his family had been watched by a \u201cpredator\u201d during their stay at Praia da Luz. His wife had come to believe that a potential perpetrator could have seen a note in the resort\u2019s guest book visible to all in reception noting their dining arrangements on the evening of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance. The couple followed up on 20 January 2008 by releasing a sketch of a \u201ccreepy man\u201d they said other holidaymakers had said they had seen loitering at the Ocean Club.In April, a month before the one-year anniversary of the fateful night, Portuguese police travelled to Leicestershire to conduct further interviews with the McCanns\u2019 friends.RecommendedWhat happened to Madeleine McCann? Five possible scenarios as Netflix documentary releasedThen, on 21 July, Portugal\u2019s attorney general, Fernando Jose Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link either the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance and closed the case, unsolved.With the trail cold and no closure in sight, the McCanns continued to publicise their cause, issuing computer-generated images of how Madeleine might look now that she had aged on 3 November 2009 and condemning the release of previously unseen Portuguese police files \u2013 detailing possible sightings of their daughter \u2013 to British newspapers in March 2010.The McCanns published a book of their own about their ordeal in May 2011, entitled simply Madeleine, which was serialised in The Sun as the newspaper led a campaign calling on British prime minister David Cameron to launch a new inquiry. He did so. Commenced by then-home secretary Theresa May, the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Operation Grange would be led by commander Simon Foy and comprise a team of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables and six civilian staff.It began to yield results in 2013, with Scotland Yard formally announcing a new investigation in July and saying in October it had identified 41 potential suspects. That same month, BBC Crimewatch released an e-fit image of a man of particular interest who had been seen in Praia da Luz with a child matching Madeleine\u2019s description in May 2007.Detectives arrived in Portugal in January 2014 promising new arrests and finally searched the village in June, interviewing four people the following month but without unearthing new information. The quartet would be definitively ruled out in April 2017, before the UK government said it would continue to fund the investigation until 2020, having already admitted it had cost \u00a310m in its first four years of operation.That investment had enabled detectives to have tens of thousands of documents translated, investigate over 8,000 potential sightings, take 1,338 statements, collect 1,027 exhibits and investigate 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest, all without definitively establishing the truth.The Madeline McCann case lay dormant before suddenly exploding into life in June 2020 when German media revealed that Christian Brueckner, a 43-year-old prisoner with a track record of child abuse and drug trafficking, had been identified as a new suspect by the public prosecutor of the German city of Braunschweig. Christian Brueckner (AFP/Getty)He had reportedly been living in a Volkswagen camper van in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine\u2019s disappearance and one woman has since come forward to suggest she saw a girl that might have been Madeleine speaking German in a supermarket in Portugal in 2017.German investigators classified their probe into his movements as a murder inquiry, saying they were working on the assumption that Madeleine is dead and reporting in July 2021 that they had found an abandoned cellar beneath his former allotment near Hanover where she could, theoretically, have been held captive.Hans Christian Wolters, the prosecutor leading the investigation into Brueckner, has said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d the inmate is responsible for kidnapping her. \u201cIf you knew the evidence we had you would come to the same conclusion as I do but I can\u2019t give you details because we don\u2019t want the accused to know what we have on him \u2013 these are tactical considerations,\u201d he told the BBC. It was subsequently revealed that Madeleine\u2019s Fund still had \u00a3773,629 to spend as of 31 March 2020, meaning the McCanns can continue to bankroll a private investigation to find their daughter long after the police hunt is finally drawn to a close, should they choose to.Brueckner was formally made a \u201carguido\u201d in relation to the case on 21 April 2022.On 19 September, the McCanns lost their libel case against Mr Amaral, the former chief inspector who had investigated the disappearance, before the European Court of Human Rights. The couple had attempted to argue that Mr Amaral was responsible for damaging their reputation and breaching their rights to respect for their private life and to be presumed innocent after taking exception to his book and associated media appearances in which he had repeatedly suggested they were responsible for the vanishing.Their complaint also argued that Portugal\u2019s Supreme Court had failed to allow them proper redress over the alleged libel by Mr Amaral after judges threw out their earlier claim in 2017.The verdict left the McCanns with three months to appeal against the decision.In February 2023, a Polish woman called Julia Faustyna made headlines by claiming she was Madeleine, using the Instagram name @iammadeleinemccann.Ms Faustyna, 21, did not provide any supporting evidence but sought DNA tests to prove her origins. The results ultimately revealed that she was entirely of Polish origin, with no British heritage, disproving her claims for good. In April 2023, a court in Braunschweig dropped a rape charge against Brueckner, unrelated to the Madeleine McCann case, concluding it did not have jurisdiction.Police in Germany continue to claim they have \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d that Madeleine is dead but this has still not been confirmed and their investigation is ongoing, with Brueckner still not charged in the McCann case. Investigators explore the Barragem do Arade beauty spot (EPA)Like her parents, Madeleine\u2019s sister Amelie, now 18, observed the 16th anniversary of her disappearance in May 2023.Speaking publicly for the first time at a prayer meeting in Rothley, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s nice that everyone is here together but it\u2019s a sad occasion.\u201dAmelie McCann reportedly joined in with chants including \u201cNever never give up\u201d, \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t forget about me\u201d and \u201cstill missing, still missed\u201d.Later that month, the case unexpectedly lurched back into life in when investigators launched a major search operation at a reservoir in the Algarve, with Mr Wolters saying they were acting on \u201ccertain tips\u201d from Brueckner, whom the prosecutor said he remains \u201cvery confident\u201d holds the key to Madeleine\u2019s disappearance.With help from Portuguese police and with Scotland Yard detectives watching on, German investigators carried out a thorough examination of the Barragem do Arade beauty spot in Silves.They combed the shoreline and surrounding grasslands with sniffer dogs, rakes, spades and pickaxes and inspected the water in a rigid-hull inflatable boat. A no-fly zone was put in place in the skies overhead to allow police drones to survey the region undisturbed.The site is located approximately 30 miles northeast of the Ocean Club resort, from which the missing girl first disappeared.In their most recent update, the investigators said they were comparing soil samples from the reservoir with others taken from Brueckner\u2019s VW camper van in an attempt to establish for certain that he was in the area during the timeframe of interest in order to try to \u201cclose the net\u201d around him."}, {"_id": "64875f3551ac331e85b9da8c", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nicola-sturgeon-arrested-former-snp-leader-s-statement-in-full-b2355555.html", "primaryCategory": "UK Politics", "subCategories": "test", "title": "Nicola Sturgeon arrested: Former SNP leader\u2019s statement in full", "lead": "<p>Nicola Sturgeon has said that her arrest was \u2018both a shock and deeply distressing\u2019  </p>", "author": "Holly Bancroft", "datePublished": "Mon, 12 Jun 2023 09:39:51 GMT", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 20:08:53.918819", "dateUpdated": "test", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/06/11/18/46d98b0625017ac4a7e0ce103c9cf9f0Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjg2NTg5MDU5-2.72568918.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": "Sign up for the View from Westminster email for expert analysis straight to your inboxGet our free View from Westminster email\n\nPlease enter a valid email addressPlease enter a valid email addressSIGN UPI would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

That is not the British tradition.\u201dSeveral opposition politicians questioned the vague wording of the law, which states that police can impose conditions on protests that cause disruption that \u201cmay be more than minor\u201d, to the \u201ccommunity\u201d - within and outside the \u201cvicinity of the procession\u201d.SNP MP Alison Thewliss asked: \u201cWhat is minor? Is it a couple of minutes late? What does \u2018affected\u2019 mean? It\u2019s really unclear in this legislation, which will give police a huge amount of discretion.\u201dJoe Middleton12 June 2023 18:171686588991Boris Johnson: Sunak\u2019s \u2018talking rubbish\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask PM to bend honours rulesBoris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of \u201ctalking rubbish\u201d over his House of Lords nominations as the increasingly bitter feud between the prime minister and his predecessor descended into open warfare.The astonishing clash came as the former Tory leader faces the final reckoning of his political career after a Commons committee finalised its Partygate report \u2013 expected to find that the former PM deliberately lied to parliament about lockdown parties.Senior Tories expect the damning privileges committee findings to finish off Mr Johnson\u2019s hopes of a comeback, telling The Independent that it would mark \u201cthe end of the circus\u201d.Adam Forrest and Archie Mitchell report.Boris Johnson: Sunak\u2019s \u2018talking rubbish\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask PM to bend honours rulesTory war of words intensifies, as party braces for verdict on whether Johnson lied about lockdown partiesJoe Middleton12 June 2023 17:561686585615The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes nextIn the fog of the Tory civil war, it\u2019s not always clear who\u2019s winning or even exactly who\u2019s on the field of battle.Sometimes there\u2019s a surprising consensus on the course of events, but also a perplexing conflict over who said what to whom.In particular, the way the nominations for Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list were handled (especially peerages for Nadine Dorries and others), is particularly opaque.But, as they say, we are where we are and it\u2019s good to know how we got here.Sean O\u2019Grady maps out a timeline:The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes nextIn the fog of the Tory civil war it\u2019s good to know how we got here, writes Sean O\u2019Grady Eleanor Noyce12 June 2023 17:001686585283Boris Johnson formally resigns as MPBoris Johnson has written to the chancellor to formally resign as the MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip, a source close to the former PM has said.

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSenior Tories have called for Boris Johnson to be blocked from standing again as an MP as the party attempts to draw a line under a weekend of mayhem triggered by his resignation. Former minister Tobias Ellwood said Mr Johnson should not be allowed to stand again until he has shown \u201ccommitment\u201d to the party, after a tumultuous few days which left it in turmoil. Mr Johnson quit in dramatic fashion on Friday but used his 1,000-word exit statement to leave open the door open for a return to Westminster. His resignation, along with two allies, has prompted three by-elections as part of what some claimed was a coordinated attempt to sabotage the Sunak administration. Mr Ellwood, who chairs the defence select committee, told The Independent: \u201cHe\u2019s directly responsible for orchestrating a mutiny and triggering multiple by-elections. So close to the election it\u2019s clear his intentions will not change.\u201cIt would be for the party machine to determine any conditions but he should not be allowed to stand in any election until a time when his commitment to the party can be reviewed.\u201dRecommendedBoris Johnson resigns \u2013 latest: Sunak allies at war with ex-PM as Shapps says \u2018world has moved on\u2019Keir Starmer tells Rishi Sunak to \u2018find a backbone\u2019 and call snap electionPatel and Rees-Mogg should not be given honours, David Lammy saysHe added: \u201cWide adulation for Johnson has been replaced with total indignation by this blatant act of political mutiny.\u201cThe prime minister should harness this opportunity to finally draw a line under the turbulent Johnson era. Any MP triggering by-elections should lose party affiliation.\u201dHis call came after former Conservative leader Michael Howard warned that the findings of the bombshell privileges committee probe into whether he misled MPs, to be published as soon as Tuesday, could end Mr Johnson\u2019s political career for good.\u201cThat is obviously going to be a very important report,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIt affects, for example, whether Boris Johnson never could ever come back into the House of Commons.\u201dLord Heseltine added: \u201cTo me, it is inconceivable that, in these circumstances, Johnson could stand as a Conservative member of parliament again. It is up to Conservative central office to affirm an official candidate.\u201dIt came as Grant Shapps, who also served in Mr Johnson\u2019s cabinet, poured cold water on a comeback for the former prime minister, as he refused to rule out that the party could block his attempt to stand again.The energy secretary said: \u201cWhether Boris Johnson will ever want to stop and I would never want to predict. The party has very clear processes in place for anybody who wants to stand for the party. It would be entirely a matter for the party itself.\u201dA cabinet minister said prime minister Rishi Sunak did not interfere with Boris Johnson\u2019s peerage nominations  (PA Archive)Mr Shapps said the Tory party \u201cdon\u2019t miss the drama\u201d of a Johnson administration, adding bluntly: \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s got many other things he wants to get on and do.\u201dHe went on: \u201cThere is no kind of chance of him coming back and saying, \u2018Right, now I\u2019m going to stand again.\u2019 From what I understand, even he has said he doesn\u2019t want to do that.\u201dMr Johnson resigned after claiming he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by a parliamentary committee tasked with investigating whether he misled parliament over lockdown parties in No 10.In an furious outburst, in which he attacked the committee and Rishi Sunak, Mr Johnson said he was leaving parliament \u201cfor now\u201d.The days since have been rife with speculation about whether he could try to stand elsewhere at the next general election, with ally Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was honoured in Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation list, claiming the former PM could \u201ceasily get back into parliament at the next election\u201d \u2013 meaning he would return next year.The former PM\u2019s departure came on the same day as his resignation honours list was approved, elevating seven allies to the House of Lords and handing out more than a dozen other gongs.But close allies within the parliamentary Conservative Party were notably absent from the list, amid speculation that their nominations had been blocked by Mr Sunak to avoid a by-election. RecommendedThe ghost of Boris Johnson will continue to haunt the Tories for a long timeBoris Johnson\u2019s toxic resignation honours list should be the lastNo 10 denies this but the assurances were not enough to stop both Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams from resigning their seats with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d and plunging the Tories into a second and third difficult by-election, alongside the one for Mr Johnson\u2019s seat. Asked about Mr Johnson\u2019s future, Mr Shapps told Sky News: \u201cHe has decided to step down and a couple of my other colleagues, all of them whom I\u2019ve worked with and Boris in particular.\u201cBut \u2026 the world has moved on. He is the one who has removed himself from the current political scene, standing down as a member of parliament. We\u2019ve got excellent leadership in place in No 10 with Rishi Sunak.\u201dThe cabinet minister added: \u201cPeople both in the Conservative Party and outside don\u2019t miss the drama of it all.\u201dA top pollster, meanwhile, also warned that the ex-prime minister\u2019s career is \u201cover\u201d for now on account of his unpopularity with the public.Asked about the prospects for a comeback by Mr Johnson, Ben Page, the chief executive of pollster Ipsos Mori, said: \u201cHis time is over in politics for the moment.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just be frank: two out of three people think he\u2019s lied and misled parliament,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen we asked people which prime minister they think did a good job or a bad job, Boris Johnson tops the bad job list by some margin.\u201dAllies of the former prime minister, however, suggested he was far from done.In an article for the Mail On Sunday, Mr Rees-Mogg said there could be a Tory \u201ccivil war\u201d if the party tried to \u201cblock\u201d him from standing.Tory MP Sir James Duddridge wrote in the Sun on Sunday: \u201cWe need more people like Boris Johnson, not fewer. My tip, head to Ladbrokes and put a fiver on him coming back, maybe even before the next election.\u201dAnd Mr Johnson\u2019s former Brexit negotiator Lord Frost wrote in the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cWe don\u2019t know where he will be back or when. But I\u2019m sure the story is not over.\u201dGuto Harri, a former spin doctor for Mr Johnson, told Sky his former boss had been \u201chounded out of politics\u201d.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on Saturday night urged Mr Sunak to call a snap election while other opposition figures accused Mr Johnson of acting like a \u201cbaby-man\u201d and blaming his mistakes on everyone else.\n\nUK news in

Read our\u00a0privacy noticeSenior Tories have called for Boris Johnson to be blocked from standing again as an MP as the party attempts to draw a line under a weekend of mayhem triggered by his resignation. Former minister Tobias Ellwood said Mr Johnson should not be allowed to stand again until he has shown \u201ccommitment\u201d to the party, after a tumultuous few days which left it in turmoil. Mr Johnson quit in dramatic fashion on Friday but used his 1,000-word exit statement to leave open the door open for a return to Westminster. His resignation, along with two allies, has prompted three by-elections as part of what some claimed was a coordinated attempt to sabotage the Sunak administration. Mr Ellwood, who chairs the defence select committee, told The Independent: \u201cHe\u2019s directly responsible for orchestrating a mutiny and triggering multiple by-elections. So close to the election it\u2019s clear his intentions will not change.\u201cIt would be for the party machine to determine any conditions but he should not be allowed to stand in any election until a time when his commitment to the party can be reviewed.\u201dRecommendedBoris Johnson resigns \u2013 latest: Sunak allies at war with ex-PM as Shapps says \u2018world has moved on\u2019Keir Starmer tells Rishi Sunak to \u2018find a backbone\u2019 and call snap electionPatel and Rees-Mogg should not be given honours, David Lammy saysHe added: \u201cWide adulation for Johnson has been replaced with total indignation by this blatant act of political mutiny.\u201cThe prime minister should harness this opportunity to finally draw a line under the turbulent Johnson era. Any MP triggering by-elections should lose party affiliation.\u201dHis call came after former Conservative leader Michael Howard warned that the findings of the bombshell privileges committee probe into whether he misled MPs, to be published as soon as Tuesday, could end Mr Johnson\u2019s political career for good.\u201cThat is obviously going to be a very important report,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIt affects, for example, whether Boris Johnson never could ever come back into the House of Commons.\u201dLord Heseltine added: \u201cTo me, it is inconceivable that, in these circumstances, Johnson could stand as a Conservative member of parliament again. It is up to Conservative central office to affirm an official candidate.\u201dIt came as Grant Shapps, who also served in Mr Johnson\u2019s cabinet, poured cold water on a comeback for the former prime minister, as he refused to rule out that the party could block his attempt to stand again.The energy secretary said: \u201cWhether Boris Johnson will ever want to stop and I would never want to predict. The party has very clear processes in place for anybody who wants to stand for the party. It would be entirely a matter for the party itself.\u201dA cabinet minister said prime minister Rishi Sunak did not interfere with Boris Johnson\u2019s peerage nominations  (PA Archive)Mr Shapps said the Tory party \u201cdon\u2019t miss the drama\u201d of a Johnson administration, adding bluntly: \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s got many other things he wants to get on and do.\u201dHe went on: \u201cThere is no kind of chance of him coming back and saying, \u2018Right, now I\u2019m going to stand again.\u2019 From what I understand, even he has said he doesn\u2019t want to do that.\u201dMr Johnson resigned after claiming he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by a parliamentary committee tasked with investigating whether he misled parliament over lockdown parties in No 10.In an furious outburst, in which he attacked the committee and Rishi Sunak, Mr Johnson said he was leaving parliament \u201cfor now\u201d.The days since have been rife with speculation about whether he could try to stand elsewhere at the next general election, with ally Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was honoured in Mr Johnson\u2019s resignation list, claiming the former PM could \u201ceasily get back into parliament at the next election\u201d \u2013 meaning he would return next year.The former PM\u2019s departure came on the same day as his resignation honours list was approved, elevating seven allies to the House of Lords and handing out more than a dozen other gongs.But close allies within the parliamentary Conservative Party were notably absent from the list, amid speculation that their nominations had been blocked by Mr Sunak to avoid a by-election. RecommendedThe ghost of Boris Johnson will continue to haunt the Tories for a long timeBoris Johnson\u2019s toxic resignation honours list should be the lastNo 10 denies this but the assurances were not enough to stop both Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams from resigning their seats with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d and plunging the Tories into a second and third difficult by-election, alongside the one for Mr Johnson\u2019s seat. Asked about Mr Johnson\u2019s future, Mr Shapps told Sky News: \u201cHe has decided to step down and a couple of my other colleagues, all of them whom I\u2019ve worked with and Boris in particular.\u201cBut \u2026 the world has moved on. He is the one who has removed himself from the current political scene, standing down as a member of parliament. We\u2019ve got excellent leadership in place in No 10 with Rishi Sunak.\u201dThe cabinet minister added: \u201cPeople both in the Conservative Party and outside don\u2019t miss the drama of it all.\u201dA top pollster, meanwhile, also warned that the ex-prime minister\u2019s career is \u201cover\u201d for now on account of his unpopularity with the public.Asked about the prospects for a comeback by Mr Johnson, Ben Page, the chief executive of pollster Ipsos Mori, said: \u201cHis time is over in politics for the moment.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just be frank: two out of three people think he\u2019s lied and misled parliament,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen we asked people which prime minister they think did a good job or a bad job, Boris Johnson tops the bad job list by some margin.\u201dAllies of the former prime minister, however, suggested he was far from done.In an article for the Mail On Sunday, Mr Rees-Mogg said there could be a Tory \u201ccivil war\u201d if the party tried to \u201cblock\u201d him from standing.Tory MP Sir James Duddridge wrote in the Sun on Sunday: \u201cWe need more people like Boris Johnson, not fewer. My tip, head to Ladbrokes and put a fiver on him coming back, maybe even before the next election.\u201dAnd Mr Johnson\u2019s former Brexit negotiator Lord Frost wrote in the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cWe don\u2019t know where he will be back or when. But I\u2019m sure the story is not over.\u201dGuto Harri, a former spin doctor for Mr Johnson, told Sky his former boss had been \u201chounded out of politics\u201d.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer on Saturday night urged Mr Sunak to call a snap election while other opposition figures accused Mr Johnson of acting like a \u201cbaby-man\u201d and blaming his mistakes on everyone else.\n\nUK news in

Read our\u00a0privacy noticePolice Scotland\u2019s investigation into alleged financial irregularities within the Scottish National Party (SNP), known as Operation Branchform, has taken a further twist after Nicola Sturgeon was arrested.Police Scotland said the former SNP leader, who quit in February, was held custody and questioned by detectives before being released without charge on Sunday (June 11).A spokesperson for Ms Sturgeon said she attended an interview \u201cby arrangement with Police Scotland, where she was to be arrested and questioned in relation to Operation Branchform\u201d.\u201cNicola has consistently said she would cooperate with the investigation if asked and continues to do so,\u201d the spokesperson said.RecommendedNicola Sturgeon arrested \u2013 latest: Former SNP leader in custody in party finances probeNicola Sturgeon arrested in investigation into SNP\u2019s financesThe former first minister\u2019s arrest comes after her husband Peter Murrell, the former SNP chief executive, was arrested in April, just weeks after he had resigned his post.He was released without charge pending further enquiries as police searched several properties and seized a luxury mobile home from the driveway of Mr Murrell\u2019s 92-year-old mother in Fife.MSP Colin Beattie was later arrested while in the role of party treasurer but released without charge pending further enquiry. He stepped down from his role.It had been widely expected that Ms Sturgeon, who continues to be the MSP for Glasgow Southside, would be quizzed by police as part of the probe. She has also pledged to \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the investigation.But the affair still represents an ignominious fall from grace for Scotland\u2019s first female and longest-serving first minister just months after she announced her resignation, with Humza Yousaf since elected to succeed her.The party in power in Scotland now appears to be haemorrhaging support as Mr Yousaf tries desperately to steady the ship, taking charge of the SNP\u2019s finances himself since Mr Beattie\u2019s resignation and reassuring his supporters the party does not face bankruptcy.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely not facing bankruptcy, I\u2019m pleased to say we are on a steady footing when it comes to the party\u2019s finances,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think parliament is the place to do a statement on the party\u2019s finances... I\u2019ve, of course, instructed the governance and transparency review, and when the report comes in on that review, I\u2019ll make that public.\u201dHere, we look back at the origins of the inquiry.Police Scotland first launched its investigation into potential criminality within the SNP\u2019s fundraising in July 2021 after a formal complaint was filed in March that year by party activist Sean Clerkin, who alleged that around \u00a3666,953 in donations raised since 2017 for a second independence referendum campaign had been spent on other things, contrary to promises made to supporters.In the months preceding the announcement of the probe, several senior figures \u2013 including SNP treasurer Douglas Chapman and MSP Joanna Cherry \u2013 quit the party\u2019s national executive committee (NEC).Mr Chapman had complained that a lack of transparency about the finances had prevented him from carrying out his \u201cfiduciary duties\u201d.Asked about the affair by STV in June 2021, Ms Sturgeon said: \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the party\u2019s finances. The finances of the SNP are independently audited... so there\u2019s full scrutiny around that.\u201cMoney hasn\u2019t gone missing... We don\u2019t hold separate accounts, we\u2019re under no legal requirement to do that, our accounts are managed on a cash flow basis.\u201dBy May 2022, the inquiry had been given the codename Operation Branchform but frustration over the apparent slow pace of its progress began to be expressed, with Mr Clerkin calling on police to \u201cstep up\u201d their efforts.The following December, it emerged that Mr Murrell had given a personal loan of \u00a3107,620 to the SNP in June 2021, which was paid to help out the party with a \u201ccash flow\u201d issue after the last Holyrood election, the SNP said.No interest was being charged by Mr Murrell and \u00a347,620 had been repaid in two instalments in August and October of 2021, Electoral Commission records revealed.Mr Yousaf has since confirmed that the party still owes the remainder of the loan, presumably around \u00a360,000, to its former chief executive. Police searched the South Lanarkshire home of Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell  (PA)Mr Clerkin lodged a fresh complaint with Police Scotland in January 2023 after it emerged that the SNP\u2019s leadership had still not been questioned 18 months on from the inquiry\u2019s launch, prompting the force to ask the Crown Office, the Scottish prosecution service, for \u201cadvice and direction\u201d in the case.On 15 February, Ms Sturgeon unexpectedly announced her resignation as first minister and SNP leader after eight years in power.In an emotional address from Bute House in Edinburgh, she spoke candidly about her time in office and the stresses of the job but declined to be drawn on the investigation when asked by one reporter, saying only, as she gathered her notes: \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss an ongoing police investigation. I wouldn\u2019t do it on any issue and I\u2019m not going to do it now.\u201dSix weeks later, after the conclusion of the election race to find her successor ended with Mr Yousaf\u2019s victory over Kate Forbes and Ash Regan, the investigation returned squarely to the spotlight with the arrest of Mr Murrell.Officers also carried out searches at a number of addresses as part of the investigation, including the South Lanarkshire home of Ms Sturgeon and Mr Murrell and SNP headquarters in Edinburgh, culminating in the confiscation of the campervan, which insiders said had been bought by the SNP for use as a campaign \u201cbattle bus\u201d.Following Mr Murrell\u2019s release, Mr Yousaf came under pressure to suspend his predecessor after Scotland\u2019s Sunday Mail reported that detectives had been handed emails showing Ms Sturgeon quashed the idea of appointing a fundraising manager in June 2021, also publishing a video of her telling the NEC there were no problems with the SNP\u2019s finances, dismissing concerns.Recommended\u2018I am certain I have committed no offence\u2019: Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s statement in full Nicola Sturgeon released without charge after arrest in SNP finances probeNicola Sturgeon: The former FM whose independence dreams were never realisedMr Beattie was arrested and released in April and later resigned after the best part of two decades as party treasurer.Ms Sturgeon was arrested on 11 June, as part of a pre-arranged interview with police, in what is unlikely to be the last development in the saga.

by Liz Truss last September to ensure households paid no more than \u00a32,500 for their electricity and gas, with the government subsidising the remainder owed to providers under Ofgem\u2019s Energy Price Cap \u2013 would be extended for a further three months.Mr Hunt had reportedly been tempted to increase the EPG to \u00a33,000, a considerably less generous offer that would have eased the burden on the state, but ultimately thought better of it, extending the guarantee into April, May and June.\u201cHigh energy bills are one of the biggest worries for families, which is why we\u2019re maintaining the energy price guarantee at its current level,\u201d the chancellor told Parliament in his Spring Statement.\u201cWith energy bills set to fall from July onwards, this temporary change will bridge the gap and ease the pressure on families, while also helping to lower inflation too.\u201dWithout that help in place, the average household would have been paying an annualised bill of \u00a34,279 between January and April but, because of the EPG, that was reduced to \u00a32,500 with the government picking up the remaining \u00a31,779.Ofgem has since dropped the price cap by 23 per cent to \u00a33,280 for the second quarter of the year, with Mr Hunt\u2019s decision meaning the public will continue to be shielded rather than pay that full amount while the state will be paying

That is not the British tradition.\u201dSeveral opposition politicians questioned the vague wording of the law, which states that police can impose conditions on protests that cause disruption that \u201cmay be more than minor\u201d, to the \u201ccommunity\u201d - within and outside the \u201cvicinity of the procession\u201d.SNP MP Alison Thewliss asked: \u201cWhat is minor? Is it a couple of minutes late? What does \u2018affected\u2019 mean? It\u2019s really unclear in this legislation, which will give police a huge amount of discretion.\u201dJoe Middleton12 June 2023 18:171686588991Boris Johnson: Sunak\u2019s \u2018talking rubbish\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask PM to bend honours rulesBoris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of \u201ctalking rubbish\u201d over his House of Lords nominations as the increasingly bitter feud between the prime minister and his predecessor descended into open warfare.The astonishing clash came as the former Tory leader faces the final reckoning of his political career after a Commons committee finalised its Partygate report \u2013 expected to find that the former PM deliberately lied to parliament about lockdown parties.Senior Tories expect the damning privileges committee findings to finish off Mr Johnson\u2019s hopes of a comeback, telling The Independent that it would mark \u201cthe end of the circus\u201d.Adam Forrest and Archie Mitchell report.Boris Johnson: Sunak\u2019s \u2018talking rubbish\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t ask PM to bend honours rulesTory war of words intensifies, as party braces for verdict on whether Johnson lied about lockdown partiesJoe Middleton12 June 2023 17:561686585615The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes nextIn the fog of the Tory civil war, it\u2019s not always clear who\u2019s winning or even exactly who\u2019s on the field of battle.Sometimes there\u2019s a surprising consensus on the course of events, but also a perplexing conflict over who said what to whom.In particular, the way the nominations for Boris Johnson\u2019s resignation honours list were handled (especially peerages for Nadine Dorries and others), is particularly opaque.But, as they say, we are where we are and it\u2019s good to know how we got here.Sean O\u2019Grady maps out a timeline:The fall of Boris Johnson: How we got here and what comes nextIn the fog of the Tory civil war it\u2019s good to know how we got here, writes Sean O\u2019Grady Eleanor Noyce12 June 2023 17:001686585283Boris Johnson formally resigns as MPBoris Johnson has written to the chancellor to formally resign as the MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip, a source close to the former PM has said.
