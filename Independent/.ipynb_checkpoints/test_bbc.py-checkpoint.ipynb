It will now be hoping to repeat the process with the help of Western-supplied munitions.<br/>President Zelensky\\'s repeated calls for Nato to send F-16 jets are being met with delays and obfuscations, for several reasons. <br/>The Ukrainian air force has trained its pilots on F-16s, which the RAF do not use, but such training takes months, not days. <br/>Logistics, maintenance and the need to find suitable runways are all important too.<br/>Finally, there is the question of escalation. Nato is struggling to balance giving Kyiv the maximum support it can, without getting directly drawn into this conflict. <br/>If Nato does end up sending F-16 warplanes, however old they may be, then that, in Moscow\\'s eyes, constitutes a major provocation by the West.<br/>Mr Zelensky said he discussed the supply of Western fighter jets with Mr Sunak. <br/>New jets were a \"very important topic for us, because we can\\'t control the sky\", the Ukrainian leader added.<br/>\"We spoke about it and I see that in the closest time you will hear some, I think, very important decisions, but we have to work a little bit more on it,\" he said. <br/>The UK has no plans to send fighter jets to Ukraine, according to the prime minister\\'s official spokesman.<br/>But No 10 said elementary training for Ukrainian pilots would begin this summer, along with British efforts to work with other countries on providing F-16 jets to Ukraine.<br/>Mr Sunak said: \"This is a crucial moment in Ukraine\\'s resistance to a terrible war of aggression they did not choose or provoke.<br/>\"They need the sustained support of the international community to defend against the barrage of unrelenting and indiscriminate attacks that have been their daily reality for over a year.\"<br/>In response, Russia said the new British weapons due to be supplied to Kyiv would only cause \"further destruction\".<br/>\"Britain aspires to position itself at the forefront of the countries that continue to pump weapons into Ukraine,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.<br/>Ukraine secured a new defence aid package from Germany after talks in Berlin with Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday, taking its total military funding to nearly $7bn (£6.44bn).<br/>Mr Zelensky described the new pledge of German Leopard tanks and anti-aircraft systems as \"the largest since the beginning of the full-scale aggression\" by Russia in February 2022.<br/>France has promised dozens more light tanks and armoured vehicles after President Emmanuel Macron met his Ukrainian counterpart in Paris.<br/>In February, Mr Zelensky visited London for the first time since the start of the war, during which he attended an audience with the King and addressed Parliament.<br/>His latest visit to the UK comes ahead of a G7 gathering in Hiroshima, Japan, later this week which will also be attended by Mr Sunak.'}\n",

Although the third candidate, ultranationalist Sinan Ogan, polled 5.17% it seemed unlikely that all his voters would switch to the centre-left-led opposition.<br/>Mr Erdogan has been in power in Turkey for more than 20 years, first as prime minister and then as president, extending his powers still further after a failed coup in 2016.<br/>Many opinion polls had suggested his rival was on course to win the first round, and Erdogan supporters celebrated outside party headquarters in Ankara long into the night. <br/>Addressing them from the balcony, he told them he had won 2.6 million more votes than his chief rival.<br/>With Mr Kilicdaroglu as candidate, the opposition was seen as having its best chance so far at removing him from power. It drew together a broad-based alliance of parties and offered an end to soaring inflation and Mr Erdogan\\'s system of an all-powerful presidency.<br/>But initial confidence in victory turned to disappointment and the opposition leader did his best to rally supporters by declaring \"we will absolutely win in the second round\".<br/>Mr Yener said all of the ballot boxes from Sunday\\'s vote had been opened and turnout in Turkey was 88.92%. However, it was clear that a number of votes cast abroad had not yet been counted.<br/>The international monitoring group OSCE highlighted several flaws in the election, pointing out that Mr Erdogan and the ruling parties had enjoyed \"an unjustified advantage\".<br/>Although the monitors praised the high turnout and political choice, they said the vote had been limited by an unlevel playing field. They singled out \"biased media coverage\", as well as intimidation of the pro-Kurdish party and the jailing of its former joint leader and that of philanthropist Osman Kavala.<br/>Another issue they highlighted was the limited help given to survivors of February\\'s earthquakes to take part in the election.<br/>Mr Erdogan was widely criticised for the state\\'s slow response to the disaster, which left more than 50,000 people dead. <br/>But it had little effect on election results in the eight cities seen as strongholds of his AK Party in the earthquake zone. In seven of the cities the president\\'s support remained above 60%. Only in Gaziantep did it slip to 59%.<br/>Sunday\\'s vote was not only for the presidency but for the 600 seats in parliament too. And here too the Erdogan party had a good night, heading for a majority of about 317 seats.<br/>Attention has now switched to the 2.79 million ballots cast for Sinan Ogan, who told BBC Turkish that without him the presidential race would have been over in one round, implying that Mtr Erdogan would have won outright.<br/>He was remorseless in his criticism of the opposition for failing to win when the ruling party was struggling with so many setbacks, from the economy to the earthquakes and the two decades of Erdogan rule.<br/>Even if he were to act as a kingmaker by endorsing one candidate or the other, it is far from certain that his first-round voters would follow his suggestion.'}\n",

These visas are not included in the official net migration figure.<br/>The home secretary told the National Conservatism conference Brexit enables a high-skilled, high wage economy to be built \"that is less dependent on low-skilled foreign labour\".<br/>The net migration figure for 2022, due to be released next week, is estimated to be at least 700,000 - according to analysis by the centre-right think tank the Centre for Policy Studies.<br/>This would be a record high, driven in part by the Ukraine resettlement scheme, but mostly by an increase in people coming to the UK to work and study from outside the EU.<br/>Ms Braverman first became home secretary in September 2022, so will arguably have largely inherited the set of migration figures due out later this month. <br/>By making this speech now she is, in effect, getting her pitch in first before those numbers are released.<br/>However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that Ms Braverman\\'s speech was \"all talk\".<br/>\"She is the home secretary. They\\'ve been in power for 13 years,\" he told LBC Radio. \"If you\\'re in the job, it\\'s your job to do it.\"<br/>The Conservatives ditched a longstanding pledge to cut net migration to the tens of thousands in their 2019 election manifesto. But Ms Braverman told the Tory party conference last October the target remained her \"ultimate aspiration\" in the long term.<br/>There are already some schemes to train UK workers in doing the jobs that the home secretary was referring to.<br/>A 16-week HGV Skills Bootcamp aims to train 11,000 people to become HGV drivers in England.<br/>There are about 41,000 vacancies in the transport and storage sector, although not all of those are HGV drivers. <br/>The British Meat Processors Association says there is currently a shortfall of about 10% in staff.<br/>The level of training required depends on the role, with some apprenticeships and food safety training available for butcher roles. More extensive training is needed for roles such as vets in abattoirs. <br/>Fruit pickers tend to get their training on the job - there are no current schemes to train UK workers in fruit picking. <br/>In August 2021, a report by accountants Grant Thornton estimated there were 500,000 vacancies in the food and farming sector - including fruit pickers. <br/>In her speech, Ms Braverman also argued it was \"not racist\" to want to control Britain\\'s borders and she is not embarrassed to say she loves Britain. <br/>\"It\\'s not xenophobic to say that mass and rapid migration is unsustainable in terms of housing supply, service and community relations.\"<br/>Senior ministers, Tory MPs and right-wing commentators will gather at the three-day event in London, including Michael Gove, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Lord Frost.<br/>Ms Braverman also said: \"I reject the left\\'s argument that it is hypocritical for someone from an ethnic minority to know these facts; to speak these truths.\"<br/>Reports that Education Secretary Gillian Keegan had been involved in \"watering down\" proposals to restrict dependents of students have been rejected by a source at the Department of Education. <br/>The source said Ms Keegan had vocally supported the \"benefits of international students\" and suggested others in government had done the same. <br/>The Times has also reported that Ms Keegan blocked plans to reduce the time foreign students can stay in the UK after finishing their course.

In the last week she just cried and just cried and begged me to help her. I didn\\'t answer.\"<br/>Mr Hunter said his wife told him she felt she had \"no life\" due to her repeated trips between hospital and home.<br/>He told the court at one point she became \"hysterical\" and to calm her down he said he would help end her suffering even though he said he had no intention of doing so.<br/>However, on the day of her death, he said he had got up to make coffee and his wife was crying.<br/>Asked by the defence barrister what he remembered, he said his \"mind switched off - I never wanted to kill her\".<br/>He added he then suffocated his wife with his hand.<br/>\"I don\\'t even know how I thought about it,\" he said.<br/>\"I don\\'t know how long I kept my hands there for. She did not attempt to stop me.<br/>\"In my statement I said that she was resisting but she wasn\\'t. She was moving her head. I don\\'t even think she opened her eyes.\"<br/>Asked about his feelings for her, Mr Hunter said he loved his wife and added: \"I regret what I had to do.<br/>\"I would never help her take her life if she hadn\\'t begged me.\"<br/>As he recounted his wife\\'s final few weeks, he said: \"She cried. She couldn\\'t do nothing. She couldn\\'t move.<br/>\"She was sleeping in the leather chair downstairs and for the last week we slept down on those chairs together.\"<br/>Responding to a question from defence lawyer Ritsa Pekri, Mr Hunter said his wife had been unable to look after herself.<br/>\"The last two or three days, she said she couldn\\'t move her arms and had trouble with her legs. She couldn\\'t balance.<br/>\"She was only eating soup. She couldn\\'t hold anything down. She lost a lot of weight.\"<br/>Under cross-examination from state prosecutor Andreas Hadjikyrou, Mr Hunter said he had been hoping for a \"small miracle\" to help his wife\\'s health improve and that she would change her mind about wanting to die.<br/>He said: \"My mind was full 24 hours a day thinking of my wife. She was lying in pain, suffering, I couldn\\'t do anything to help her. <br/>\"I wanted her to change her mind. I kept saying it\\'s not easy [to help someone die], you can\\'t just do something like that.<br/>\"I had no intention of killing her.<br/>\"It was her decision, she didn\\'t want any more treatment. I can\\'t tell her, she\\'s got her own mind and she asked me. She wasn\\'t just my wife, she was my best friend.<br/>\"You haven\\'t seen the strain of the last six years, what she\\'s gone through - the situation, the pressure. I wouldn\\'t like anyone to go through the last six months we both went through.\"<br/>Asked by the prosecution why he had told a doctor he had decided to end his wife\\'s life but not tell her in case she changed her mind, Mr Hunter said he was \"under so much pressure\" and there were some things he could not remember as a result of a stroke.<br/>He said he had told his wife that if she did die, he would have to take his own life, saying to her: \"I don\\'t want to be without you for the rest of my life.\"<br/>Earlier in the trial, the court heard Mr Hunter contacted his brother on Facebook to say he had killed his wife and then tried to take his own life at their home in Tremithousa.<br/>Cypriot police were alerted by Interpol in the UK shortly before 20:00 GMT on 18 December 2021.<br/>Officers arrived at the couple\\'s retirement property and Mr Hunter was taken to hospital and later arrested.<br/>The couple had moved from Ashington to Paphos 20 years ago.<br/>After the day\\'s proceedings drew to a close, Mr Hunter spoke to reporters about giving evidence and said: \"I got my say, this is what I wanted.
