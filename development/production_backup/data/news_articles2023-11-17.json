These rules currently include getting the annual deficit down to less than the equivalent of 3% of national income (or GDP) within five years. And secondly making sure that by then, the total debt amassed over the years is falling when measured as a proportion of GDP."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Breaching such rules can be costly: the big giveaway in Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-Budget of September 2022 led to a surge in borrowing rates (which also swelled mortgage rates).

A projected shortfall is often referred to as a black hole, any wiggle room is called headroom."}, {"type": "text", "text": "As Jeremy Hunt says higher interest rates have been deployed by the Bank of England to fight the recent stubborn bout of inflation. And that has vastly bumped up the government's borrowing costs. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "But higher inflation has also delivered the chancellor a boost in revenues from things like VAT and income tax. VAT is a percentage of an item's value, so when things go up in price, the government gets more tax."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Also as prices rise, there's pressure to put up wages, then workers get dragged into higher tax brackets - known as fiscal drag - which means the government collects more income tax. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "So economists reckon the chancellor could have over £10bn of headroom. But what matters is what the OBR thinks - and even headroom of this size would mean this chancellor has far less to 'play' with then many of his predecessors in relation to his rules. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Whether and how the government meets its rules, how it uses headroom, depends on its policy choices, the tax and spending plans aligned with its political priorities, as well as on how the economy is performing. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Those choices mean there are trade-offs, winners and losers. So it's not a case of the chancellor unable to 'afford' to do something or that he 'must' adopt a particular policy. For example, if he wanted to extend the freeze in fuel duty that would cost £4bn (as the OBR is obliged to assume that duty rises annually). If he didn't have headroom, he could offset that by raising taxes elsewhere or squeezing spending. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Even if the OBR agrees the chancellor has several billions of pounds of headroom, he may not opt to splash it right now. There is after all, a general election looming - and likely a spring Budget beforehand."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It might be considered more politically advantageous to dole out sweeteners to voters then. Moreover, if the economy suffers an unexpectedly sharp downturn in the meantime, that could wipe out some of that headroom - potentially leaving the chancellor in the embarrassing position of having to claw back cash to meet his rules."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Or, come the spring, there could actually be more headroom; which he may well choose to use up rather than leave as a generous gift to whoever is chancellor following the election. So instead, this Autumn Statement may focus on the key terms and longer-term measures, such as levelling up, boosting the supply of workers, tackling growth, that the government wants to use to frame its election strategy."}, {"type": "text", "text": "So a pre-Christmas spree seems unlikely, regardless of your wishlist. That's not to say Mr Hunt won't be tempted to offer around a little platter of canapés, a taster of what could come in the spring."}, {"type": "text", "text": "But don't get too distracted by any nibbles served up.

Zverev lost and Sinner won – a perfectly symmetrical result for the start of Kyrgios's career on camera."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Surprisingly, the man billed by the Tennis Channel as 'the human highlights reel' has also done his fair share of filler, enlivening the dead air with a 'Here we go, two break points for Zverev' here and a 'He needs some first serves here' there. He's dropped pleasing bits of player lingo into his commentary: 'short replies' for short returns, encouraging Rune to 'finish the set off with good habits' after the Dane got toweled in the opening stanza against Sinner. He's had a solidly comic gaffe: asking viewers to 'look at people that have had sex against Medvedev' before swallowing hard and quickly correcting to 'success'. And he's proved adept at coming up with interesting ways to say 'that was a good shot', which is after all what a lot of commentary involves. Here was his call after a superb lunging cross-court backhand from Sinner: 'Incredible. Ridiculous. How. Question marks.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Most illuminating of all has been the insight that Kyrgios has offered into his own approach to facing the sport's best players. We've learned that Medvedev's serve can sometimes be picked because he tends to throw the ball out to the right too much; that Kyrgios often 'lies' with his ball toss ('One of my strengths is that I can hit all the serves off different ball tosses, you gotta keep people guessing'); that he does not warm up before matches; that he was virtually coaching Rune for six months a few years ago after the young Dane slid into his DMs to ask for advice. Asked whether he'd rather be loved or genuine, Kyrgios immediately replied: 'Genuine. I don't mind being the villain – I've definitely experienced stadiums where not one person's been going for me, it's a great feeling. You find some really dark energy when the whole stadium doesn't want you to win, those are some of the best moments.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Candor of this variety has been a feature of this year for Kyrgios, who's endured a reckoning of sorts. He's spent much of the season in rehab for his various injuries, but still consistently managed to make headlines. He admitted shoving his ex-girlfriend but in February the assault charge he was given over the incident was dismissed; Kyrgios later issued a public apology for his actions. In May he helped Canberra police catch the man who stole a Tesla from his mother at gunpoint. Over the summer he revealed that he contemplated suicide after losing to Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2019, part of a string of commendably forthright revelations about his struggles with drinking and self-harm: 'I ended up in a psych ward in London to figure out my problems. I was drinking, abusing drugs, lost my relationship with my family, pushed all my close friends away. You could tell I was hurting.' That emotion and openness are among Kyrgios's great character assets; his readiness to show vulnerability marks him out as a rare specimen among modern athletes, who are almost universally controlled and media managed to the point of robotic tedium."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Kyrgios has long had a fractious relationship with Australia's media and tennis establishment – partly because of his contempt for authority but also, I sense, because he doesn't fit the model of the Anglo-Celtic 'good boy' that has been Australian tennis's traditional pinup. He's no Lew Hoad, no Pat Rafter, no Ken 'Muscles' Rosewall; he's not even a Lleyton Hewitt. He's a Greek-Malaysian kid from Canberra who's fanatically committed to the Boston Celtics, simulates sex acts on court, and loves his mum. When I was a child my Greek-Cypriot grandmother used to call anyone monkeying about and trying to be funny 'Karagiozis', and I see something of that folkloric clown in Kyrgios, in his lust for provocation and comedy. Perhaps the only country that has the comfort with unruly complexity to truly accept him for who he is, is America. On the basis of his stint on set this week, all shrugs and gossip and nonchalant conversational lobs about his beloved Celtics, that certainly seems to be the case."}, {"type": "text", "text": "If there's news that emerged from Kyrgios's time behind the mic, it's that he plans to retire in one or two years: 'Kygs has got about a year or two left, then I can sit back and watch these young bucks go at it,' he said during the Sinner-Rune encounter, while noting that he may still seek Djokovic's advice on 'alien longevity stuff'. This isn't exactly news, since Kyrgios has set out the retirement plan before: last year he told an Instagram Q&A that once he passes 30, he'll 'probably go to my house in the Bahamas and just sit and do nothing'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the era of the Big Three we're used to players carrying on into early middle age, but until Roger Federer came along, 30 was generally seen as the natural end point of a top tennis player's time among the pros. Björn Borg quit at 26; Marat Safin blootered his career into the tram lines after he turned 29; Pete Sampras hung up the baggy shorts at 32. Kyrgios retiring once he passes 30 would be a reversion to the historical norm. But for anyone who loves tennis it would be a shame. The greatest compliment I can pay the man's punditry is that it immediately made me want to watch him play again. Kyrgios the commentator, no matter how casually commanding, will never match Kyrgios the player, this volatile maestro of the lines. Tennis after Kygs will be more polite, more tasteful, perhaps even more graceful. But it will be far less interesting."}]}, {"_id": "655745d6a62f205351e3f977", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/17/school-strike-4-climate-australian-students-skip-classes-en-masse-to-call-for-action", "articleType": "text", "primaryCategory": "environment", "subCategories": [], "title": "School Strike 4 Climate: Australian students skip classes en masse to call for action", "lead": "Hundreds of school students marched their way to Tanya Plibersek’s office with thousands protesting in Melbourne", "author": "Rafqa Touma and Australian Associated Press", "datePublished": {"$date": "2023-11-17T11:52:06.789Z"}, "dateScraped": {"$date": "2023-11-17T11:52:06.789Z"}, "dateUpdated": {"$date": "2023-11-17T11:52:06.789Z"}, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2ac22ee1ef0b1627855bf2a27562fe920aadb6de/278_338_3265_1960/500.jpg", "body": [{"type": "text", "text": "Nirvana Talukder didn't go to school on Friday – but she says she was thinking about her future."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The 16-year-old was among hundreds of school students who marched their way to federal environment minister Tanya Plibersek's office in Surry Hills, Sydney, calling for action on climate change.

The word is that Jeremy Hunt, with a little sleight of hand, will fail to uprate them fairly. He will use joyous headlines that inflation has halved, and as it falls so of course benefits can too: nothing will be said of how benefits lagged when inflation was on the way up as well as on the way down. No one will feel this inflation 'fall' when prices still rise by 4.6% (considerably higher still than the US or EU). The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) says prices are 20% higher than in April 2021, food prices are up by 30% and energy prices are two-thirds higher. Benefits fell well behind.

Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, told the Commons that more than 2.5 million people were on benefits and inactive due to a long-term health condition, and work coaches in job centres would now judge how much effort they made to find a job.

Childcare, which would allow them to work, is unaffordable, carers need help, job centres need to offer training and genuine support. Investing in carrots will end up saving far more by getting people into work, than sticks that only drive people away.

The failure of the NHS to treat everyone in time is a major cause of Britain's economic and productivity failures.

how society in the British Isles has arranged itself around … two versions of 'stuffed''. On the one hand, there is that post-dinner feeling of being pleasantly replete with delicious, wholesome food. But then there's also 'stuffed' in the sense of being trapped in an impossible situation with no safe way out. This is the experience of the millions of Britons currently living with chronic food insecurity, obliged to fill up on cheap meals to satisfy immediate hunger pangs while skimping on the nutrients that every body needs."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is the lack of common ground between these two types of stuffedness, the privileged and the deprived, that troubles Vogler. She points to the fault line that opened up during Marcus Rashford's 2020 campaign to extend free school meals into the school holidays. Kate Green, the former shadow education secretary, supported the scheme on the grounds that 'it is the government's responsibility to ensure that children do not go hungry'. Brendan Clarke-Smith, for the government, countered that he did not believe in 'nationalising children': feeding your family was a matter for individuals, not the state."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Vogler suggests that the roots of this division go all the way back to the 15th-century enclosure movement, which saw landlords fencing off the common land on which cottagers had previously grazed their animals, foraged food and collected firewood. By way of compensation for these lost rights, each villager got a small strip of land that wasn't big enough to do more than grow vegetables. Abolishing Britain's small-holding culture while consolidating food production into large, privatised silos effectively deprived the growing population of an intimate relationship with its food. It also created the conditions where emerging agri-business competed to bring produce to market at the lowest possible cost. Unlike those European countries that retain something of the small-holding mindset, Britons are particularly vulnerable to being scanted and scammed when it comes to their food."}, {"type": "text", "text": "To illlustrate this long decline, Vogler presents a series of detailed case histories. Take strawberries. In the 16th century they were a peasant indulgence, looked at askance by an elite who saw them as death-dealing if gobbled down with too much cream, which is what ravenous rustics were apt to do. From here they went upmarket, morphing into a brief six-week high-summer treat whose sweetness aligned them with female tastes (a man who ate too many was believed to be in danger of becoming effeminate). In the 20th century, strawberries' association with Wimbledon made them socially smart while the pick-your-own farmshop movement of the 1970s returned them to a fantasy of communal rural labour."}, {"type": "text", "text": "These days, thanks to polytunnels and a tentacular global transport system, strawberries are available from late March to autumn, although there is an unofficial competition taking place to see who can be first to get them ready in time for Valentine's Day. In many supermarkets they are the top sellers, outpacing the far more pedestrian bread and milk. Vogler reels off the qualities of this modern-day cultivar, from its mildew resistance to its bland sweetness to its unnaturally throbbing colour. Nor does she disguise her unease: 'The fruity lure of the strawberry hides something darker at the heart of our food system.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "What is that darkness exactly and how do we let in the light? Vogler does not pretend that the answer is simple or obvious. She is excellent, as in her 2020 book Scoff, at foraging among the sources to bring us wonderful stories of older food cultures. Of how in medieval times parsnips were just the thing if you were having difficulty conceiving, or of how artichokes in wine would rid you of body odour. Suffering from depression? Then radishes – with salt and pepper – will lift your spirits in a jiffy."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It is in the difficult business of gathering up these narrative ingredients to make a food future that is equitable and safe that things get really tricky. Vogler concludes by suggesting that nothing will become unstuffed until we – individuals, state, agri-business, energy suppliers, transport planners – begin to work together, not just for the greater good, but to save ourselves."}, {"type": "text", "text": "• Stuffed: A History of Good Food and Hard Times in Britain by Pen Vogler is published by Atlantic (£22).

French protests are always lively, but as the journalist John Lichfield observed, 'the white-hot anger' of the gilets jaunes was 'something new and different'.

Residents of Uxbridge, on the outer edge of London's Ulez boundary, where Labour recently lost a byelection, told the Guardian they opposed it on the grounds that the costs for pollution were falling on ordinary people during a period when the cost of living was rising. It is true that the rightwing press stoked anti-Ulez sentiment, and that there was a scrappage scheme that covered some of the cost of replacing cars – but few things motivate political action like the cost of living. By January 2019, the gilets jaunes had vandalised an estimated 60% of France's fixed speed cameras, arguing they were just a means of squeezing poor people out of money.

The blade runners, by contrast, are a fringe group.

This is particularly true for people living on the peripheries of major cities who need cars to get around and are often self-employed, driving for work. The demographic of the Ulez backlash was unsurprising to anyone who knew about the gilets jaunes. Another important lesson is that the backlash can have many consequences: in this case, it created the political space for the Tories to embrace environmentally destructive policies such as the expansion of North Sea oil drilling."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Britain is not the only country failing to learn the lessons of the gilets jaunes movement.

It was then watered down to allow a longer phase-in time. But even with the promise of grants to cover 70% of the cost of the heat pumps, many people felt they were being asked to pay too much and that the policy was being imposed on them in a one-size-fits-all way.

Ludosky told me recently that she thinks the gilets jaunes have had two main legacies. The first is that French people are more concerned about the poor health of their democracy – since the carbon levy they have campaigned for democratic reform (though this has proven harder to deliver than the tax U-turn). The second legacy is that any talk of the ecological transition is now accompanied by ideas for how to make it fair.

Scan the list of those who held the line – some with far slimmer majorities than the rebels, or representing parts of cities with big Muslim communities or hefty support for anti-war Greens – and in some ways it's surprising the revolt was not bigger. Those who held their nerve will, however, need a more emotionally compelling argument if they're to defend that position over coming weeks. And for Starmer, that was always going to be the hard part.

To sum up this process in a soundbite would always have been hard, but in the early days of the crisis, calling for 'humanitarian pauses' may just have covered it.

It does so, most unusually for a government paper, under a picture of Rishi Sunak, with his personal foreword. But who was the proud parent of this £100bn monster mistake?

The enormous sums involved 'could be far better spent'. Quite so."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The only thing in this paper I cannot understand is why, after so demolishing HS2 as a concept, Sunak did not stop it and give the huge savings to the NHS. Just last month, it was reported that the cost of the surviving line to Birmingham had risen by a fifth in just four months to £68bn in today's prices. This is inexcusable. Even the transport department's top civil servant, Bernadette Kelly, admitted to a House of Commons committee around the same time that it 'would represent poor value for money'.

That is indicated by Sunak's additional decision that the new Euston station – now a huge building site – will still go ahead. He says he can shrink its costs by an implausible £6.5bn and get the private sector to pay for the rest. He cited Battersea power station, the most over-developed site in London, or Canary Wharf.

Communities with robust social ties – 'where people learn how to follow and lead each other and achieve shared goals', she says – weather adversity much better than places where bonds are weaker.

To harness this power, Wray says we need to invest in building relationships: for example by getting to know our neighbors, getting off of our devices and going into shared physical space where we can relate to people, such as working together at community centers, public gardens and local markets.

Perhaps a better description might be structure versus flexibility. England's early years under Southgate were defined by a search for midfield stability.

'But I think it wouldn't be high enough to achieve some of the more expensive cultural changes.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Chrisp agrees that in the medium term, there must be a strategy to help workers to secure new roles in a changing economy. And, in the shorter term, a safety net for those same workers must be found.

The film taps into a (marginally) darker side to Wilson."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Wilson made his debut, along with his brother Luke, in this hugely loved, quirky and faintly slacker-ish film from the 90s era of Linklater and Tarantino. It was developed from an earlier short film, and Anderson's trademarks were not yet really in evidence. Wilson – with short hair, rather like that of a member of the US Marine Corps, which the actor had been thinking of joining – plays a young guy trying to get his friend (Luke) sprung from psychiatric hospital so that they can carry out a series of heists. Again, this film hints very obliquely at real sadness and pain."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This date-movie weepie heartwarmer, however unbearable, undoubtedly has a major position in the Wilson canon. He plays John Grogan, a journalist married to a woman played by his nearest female movie-actor equivalent, Jennifer Aniston. His professional and personal life is redeemed by writing a regular column about his relationship with his dog, an adorable labrador called Marley who is with him during all his personal travails, until of course Marley gets sick and his time in this vale of tears comes to an end. Wilson's tearful final speech to Marley at the vet's ('You're a great dog …!') made demands of him as an actor as no other film did."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Wilson's wedding comedy is likable and funny, and deserves to be remembered a bit more than it is. He goes into his good-natured wackiness mode in this three's-a-crowd caper, in which he plays a goofy loser called Dupree who gets in between a married couple, a bit like Bill Murray in What About Bob?. Matt Dillon and Kate Hudson play two newlyweds who rashly feel sorry for Dupree, Carl's best man, who has just lost his home and job. They let him crash with them – with awful results."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The sheer high-concept outrageousness of this comedy – very much a product of the frat-pack 00s – has kept it a fan favourite, and there are real laughs. Wilson is perfectly positioned alongside the grinning figure of Vince Vaughn. They play two commitment-phobe guys who are running an appalling scam: they gatecrash weddings to zero in on attractive single women who are feeling vulnerable because they are not yet married and sentimentally believe that a man they meet at a wedding must be The One. Of course, it is nice-guy Wilson who really does fall for someone there, and he nicely plays both the cynicism and then the emotional life lesson."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Wilson's vocal performance in this Pixar animation is arguably the nearest he ever got to a conventional action-adventure lead – it's not my favourite Pixar but, undoubtedly, he flavoured it with his winning personality. He is Lightning McQueen, a feisty, headstrong young sports car who is dead set on winning the prestigious Piston cup on his very first outing. But events conspire to strand him in the middle of the desert, where he learns lessons in humility from an old 50s auto voiced by Paul Newman. In some ways, the beaming face of Lightning McQueen personifies the perky, upbeat side of Wilson's persona."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Wilson has a supporting but very distinctive role here in this great Wes Anderson film, as someone who is not part of the dysfunctional Tenenbaum family, presided over by Gene Hackman's haughty paterfamilias. As neighbour Eli Cash, he affects a Stetson and writes sub-Larry McMurtry western novels, coolly affronted when critics fail to call him a genius; at one point, he distractedly walks out of a TV interview that had alluded to the relative failure of an early work. He is the best friend of tortured tennis champ Richie Tenenbaum, played by Luke Wilson, a relationship that revives something of the Bottle Rocket dynamic and creates an agonised problem when Richie reveals himself to be in love with his adopted sister Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is dating Eli."}, {"type": "text", "text": "A tremendously good comic turn is what Wilson delivers in this broad comedy, remade from a 90s indie. Ben Stiller plays a beta-male with the name Gaylord 'Greg' Focker, whose girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) brings him home to meet her parents, the dad being a terrifying ex-CIA man amusingly played by Robert De Niro. Greg is horribly humiliated throughout the visit, but never more than by meeting Pam's ex-boyfriend Kevin, wonderfully played by Wilson: a mega-wealthy alpha male, inspired by Jesus to become a carpenter, who can't quite grasp that Greg's job as a nurse isn't 'volunteer' work he's selflessly doing away from what must surely be proper employment."}, {"type": "text", "text": "One of Anderson's most audacious and yet inspired moves was this Americanisation of Roald Dahl's story Fantastic Mr Fox as a stop-motion animation in which all the leads were voiced by Americans and all the kids play a baseball-type sport called 'whack bat'. This is taught by Coach Skip, laconically voiced by Wilson, who, with his descriptions of whack bat's arcane mysteries, beguilingly conveys how strange it all is, and how strange the whole story is, all with a light touch."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It may not be Anderson's best film but Wilson has a very touching role as Ned, a young guy who hero-worships the Jacques Cousteau-type oceanographer Steve Zissou, played by Bill Murray. Ned leaves his job as an airline pilot to volunteer with Steve's crew, and even bankrolls the next Zissou documentary – the implication being that Ned is in fact Steve's son. There is a lot of deadpan comedy along the way, but Murray and Wilson together get an unexpectedly exciting and then affecting death scene in the helicopter they're piloting."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Wilson carries an old-fashioned romantic lead in Woody Allen's minor but still relatively amusing fantasy-comedy (certainly more satisfyingly than in Bogdanovich's comparable film She's Funny That Way). He is a disillusioned Hollywood screenwriter who comes to Paris for a break with his fiancee (Rachel McAdams) and, pining for the belle époque, gets into a carriage that carries him back in time to the city of Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Picasso; he even has a dalliance with Picasso's mistress, played by Marion Cotillard. Wilson plays the role with absolutely the right kind of throwaway fun: he is bemused and excited, bobbing along on the action like a cork on water."}, {"type": "text", "text": "So hot right now! Wilson's masterpiece has to be his portrayal of the overwhelmingly handsome and compellingly modish male model with the unimprovable name of Hansel, the young contender who snatches the male model crown from the head of pouting Derek Zoolander, played by Ben Stiller. The montage scene at the Male Model of the Year awards, showing Hansel's achievements in modelling, is a glorious showcase for Wilson's actual, overwhelming handsomeness. To an off-camera interviewer, Hansel establishes his sensitivity and emotional intelligence by murmuring, 'Richard Gere's a real hero of mine … and Sting.' And his 'walk-off' contest with Zoolander, judged by David Bowie, is another iconic moment."}]}, {"_id": "655745d7a62f205351e40ba7", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/16/israel-drops-leaflets-warning-people-to-flee-southern-gaza-towns", "articleType": "text", "primaryCategory": "world", "subCategories": [], "title": "Israel drops leaflets warning people to flee southern Gaza towns", "lead": "Flyer campaign raises fears war could spread to areas IDF previously said were safe", "author": "Emine Sinmaz in Jerusalem", "datePublished": {"$date": "2023-11-17T11:52:07.536Z"}, "dateScraped": {"$date": "2023-11-17T11:52:07.536Z"}, "dateUpdated": {"$date": "2023-11-17T11:52:07.536Z"}, "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/29f865e57f9d0673965fe1b2a5ef73f4e25c0b18/0_129_4128_2477/500.jpg", "body": [{"type": "text", "text": "Israel has dropped leaflets into southern Gaza telling Palestinian civilians to leave four towns on the eastern edge of Khan Younis, raising fears that its war against Hamas could spread to areas it previously said were safe."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The flyers told civilians in Bani Shuhaila, Khuza'a, Abassan and al-Qarara that anyone in the vicinity of militants or their positions was 'putting his life in danger', local people told Reuters."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In northern Gaza, the Israeli operation in al-Shifa hospital continued on Thursday after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered the sprawling compound in the early hours of Wednesday morning."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Tens of thousands of people have fled from north to south Gaza in recent weeks, crowding into UN-run shelters and family homes in Khan Younis, the biggest city in the south."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The UN's human rights chief, Volker Türk, said that five weeks into the war, 'massive outbreaks of infectious disease, and hunger' seemed inevitable in the densely populated Palestinian territory.
