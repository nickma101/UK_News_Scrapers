      "<p>Brussels is locked in a row with British regulators after waving through a $69bn (£55bn) video game takeover by Microsoft that had been blocked in the UK.</p><p>The European Commission approved Microsoft's deal to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard on Monday after concluding that competition fears were not enough to justify halting the tie-up.</p><p>It contradicts a ruling last month by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/04/26/microsoft-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-merger-blocked/\">which blocked the deal</a> and said it would harm consumers in the growing market for cloud gaming, where games are streamed over the internet rather than relying on powerful hardware in a console or PC.</p><p>In response, the CMA issued an unusual statement defending its decision and suggesting the Commission was wrong not to act.</p><p>Sarah Cardell, chief executive, said: “The UK, US and European competition authorities are unanimous that this merger would harm competition in cloud gaming.</p><p>“Microsoft’s proposals, accepted by the European Commission today, would allow Microsoft to set the terms and conditions for this market for the next ten years. They would replace a free, open and competitive market with one subject to ongoing regulation of the games Microsoft sells, the platforms to which it sells them, and the conditions of sale.</p><p>“While we recognise and respect that the European Commission is entitled to take a different view, the CMA stands by its decision.”</p>\n",

      "<p>EU vice president Margrethe Vestager hailed her officials’ decision on Monday as “an important step” for the bloc, saying:</p><p>“Video games attract billions of users all over the world. In such a fast-growing and dynamic industry, it is crucial to protect competition and innovation.</p><p>“Our decision represents an important step in this direction, by bringing Activision’s popular games to many more devices and consumers than before thanks to cloud game streaming.”</p><p>A Brussels spokesman added that the Commission had “based its decision on hard evidence and on extensive information and feedback”, while sources dismissed the UK's concerns about cloud gaming, saying that it accounted for just 1pc to 2pc of the overall market and any potential competition impact was therefore not significant.</p><p>The takeover has been politically charged since the CMA intervention, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/06/microsoft-eu-lawyer-activision-call-of-duty-merger/\">which triggered a warning from Activision that Britain was “closed for business”.</a>=</p><p>Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, said at the time that the intervention showed that the EU was a more attractive location than the UK.</p><p>The takeover needed approval from both EU and UK regulators to go ahead, meaning that the CMA's decision has effectively killed it unless it is overturned on appeal. The US Federal Trade Commission is also suing Microsoft to block the deal.</p><p>Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision, strongly hinted on Monday that his company would now expand into EU countries instead of Britain.</p><p>Mr Kotick said: “We intend to meaningfully expand our investment and workforce throughout the EU, and we’re excited for the benefits our transaction brings to players in Europe and around the world.”</p><p>Lulu Cheng Meservey, chief communications officer at Activision, praised the EU's “firm yet pragmatic, unbiased, and fact-driven approach to regulation”.</p><p>British officials rallied to defend the CMA. A government spokesman said: “Every major competition authority – including in the EU and the US – agrees this merger would harm competition.”</p><p>“The UK has the biggest tech sector in Europe and the third largest globally valued at $1tn, demonstrating the UK is open for business and an attractive place to invest.”</p><p>UK competition officials said in April that Microsoft has a 60-70pc share of the cloud gaming market, adding that this number doubled over the past year.</p><p>Activision’s share price crashed after the CMA decision was announced, while Monday’s decision saw little significant movement for either company. The Call of Duty publisher has said it is working “aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal”.</p><p>A spokesman said at the time: “The report’s conclusions are a disservice to UK citizens, who face increasingly dire economic prospects.”</p><p>Both companies are understood to be taking a legal case against the CMA to Britain’s Competition Appeal Tribunal.</p>\n",

      "<p>Good evening and welcome to our live blog of Monday night football, in which Leicester City welcome Liverpool to the King Power Stadium. It looks a very tough, very important evening for the hosts; they are in serious trouble on 30 points, second from bottom. On the upside, a win would take them out of the drop zone, and even a draw would see them inch above Leeds into 18th due to a superior goal difference. But with just one win in 13 PL matches, including damaging defeats at home to Bournemouth and Villa, and away losses at Fulham, Palace and Southampton, it is tough to be optimistic. They have given up far too many points against the bottom half of the table.</p><p><strong>Sam Wallace</strong> says <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/14/premier-league-leicester-spiral-brink-relegation/\">Hubris and muddled-thinking have seen Leicester spiral to brink of relegation</a> and, in an excellent piece, charts what he calls \"an astonishing tale of rise and fall\". Sam looks at the club hierarchy and decision-making process and examines where it all went wrong just a few years after the League win that I am confident in saying will remain the greatest team sport achievement of our lifetimes. Let me know in the comments if I have missed one.</p><p>Talking of League tables, Liverpool might not be the force they were a few years ago but they are clearly getting in the groove again, albeit too late for this term. Six Premier League wins in the last six matches have propelled Jurgen Klopp's side to fifth in the table after 35 games. If they can take nine points from nine starting tonight they can at least force their great historical rivals Man United, four points ahead of them in fourth, to stay honest to the last. United incidentally have won three, lost two, drawn one of their last six League games so Liverpool have certainly got them in their sights.</p><p>On the matter of United and Liverpool, their representatives on Sky Sports, Messrs Neville and Carragher will be on Sky's Monday Night Football tonight from 6.30pm in an extended programme, and they are joined by Howard Webb. Webb, a former PL ref of course, is now the Chief Refereeing Officer of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, the body that administers the Video Assistant Referee function and he'll explain all about it on Sky's Monday Night Football and field what will hopefully be some searching questions. For those who prefer acronyms, that's Howard Webb, CRO PGMOL (VAR) MNF. Sounds like a good military man, what what.</p><p>We will keep an eye on what he says throughout, and may welcome some special guests onto the blog in the shape of Telegraph Sport's very own Thom Gibbs and Luke Edwards, and maybe even referee expert Keith Hackett. So that is your Monday evening sorted.</p>\n",

      "<p>Cardiff will briefly become the centre of the pop universe on Wednesday as <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/taylor-swift-vs-beyonce-eras-renaissance-uk-tour-pop/\">Beyoncé </a>begins the UK leg of her blockbusting <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/beyonce-renaissance-tour-uk-what-to-expect-setlist/\">Renaissance tour </a>at the city’s Principality Stadium. But the marathon three-hour set, with its dazzling costume changes, phalanxes of dancers and a gem-encrusted flying horse, is more than the work of a single person. Behind Beyoncé, is an inner circle of assistants and confidantes.</p><p>Being a professional bestie to Beyoncé is, not surprisingly, a full-time gig. Whether passing her lip gloss on the red carpet or aiding Beyoncé in bringing a political and feminist perspective to her music, the expertise and advice of this coterie of helpers has proved crucial as she has taken her career to ever greater heights.</p><p>With a work ethic almost as hardcore as Beyoncé’s, the team have done their bit to mould the singer's message – which is that pop music can be more than simply entertainment and can address issues around race, gender and culture (though politics take a back seat on her glittering new tour). She has reshaped the genre in her own image and, without her collaborators, she couldn’t have done any of it. Here’s a who's-who of the real Bey-hive, past and present.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal\">The new guard</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Sam Greenberg: the personal assistant</h2><p>On the red carpet, Beyoncé is rarely to be seen without her trusted personal PA, who has been joined to the star at the hip for more than a decade. She has a unique talent for blending into the background – and only really came to attention that time Beyoncé asked her to stop adjusting the plunging maroon gown she wore to a 2015 Tidal party. Generally, Greenberg keeps her head down and knows how to dress so as to appear invisible.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>“I try to blend in the background as much as possible,” she once observed. “Being on the red carpet is the most glamorous, but for me, like for the Grammys this year, I wore a pair of black jeans and a black tank top.”</p><p>She doesn’t do it all on her own, however. Beyoncé’s other assistant is Kaleb Steele, currently on the road with Bey as head of “tour operations” and who, with impressive understatement, refers to himself as “special assistant to the chair of Parkwood Entertainment”. That would be Beyoncé, who established Parkwood – her management, production, entertainment company and record label – in 2010.</p><hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Andrew Makadsi: the creative director</h2><p>Beyoncé’s creative director was in Stockholm for the first night of the Renaissance tour and is believed to be making his way to Cardiff for the UK dates. The son of a Beirut cab driver, he worked with Chanel and Louis Vuitton before coming to the attention of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/kayne-west-antisemitism-brands-cut-ties-career/\">Kanye West</a> and rapper Big Sean, who hired him to style their tours.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>This led to a gig at Beyoncé Parkwood group, where he received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Production Design for the 2019 Netflix concert special, Homecoming, filmed at Coachella in California the previous year. He’s continued his collaboration with Beyoncé on the Renaissance tour, saying “Never underestimate any small project.When you work on something, make sure that you are going to be proud”.</p><p>Makadsi is proud of what he has accomplished with Beyoncé. Nonetheless, he sees himself primarily as a facilitator to the singer. She is the one calling the shots. “She’s an artist–she knows what she wants,” he told Vogue Middle East. “A lot of the creative comes from her. She is the mastermind. We’re a team. It’s like an orchestra and she’s the maestro.”</p><hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Sylvia Shann: the tour manager</h2><p>Having had her big break working with ’Nsync and Puff Daddy in 2002, Shann joined the Beyoncé organisation ahead of her landmark 2018 Coachella concert – a performance instantly acclaimed as one of the greatest-ever headliners at a festival. It had everything: ranks of drummers, Beyoncé dressed as Queen Nefertiti and singing while looming over the crowd on a giant ladder, and then temporarily reuniting with the rest of Destiny’s Child.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Watching in the wings, ensuring all the moving parts functioned perfectly was Shann. She was in the job just a wet week. “I wanted to experience the big waters where the big fish are. I knew everything that I had learned to date had covered every area of production, but to be tasked with such a heavy position was terrifying. The first show I did was her Coachella performance,” she said.</p><p>“As road manager, I’m responsible for basically everybody you see on the stage. I was coordinating with everybody. I was doing logistics, even the boring stuff like the hiring and insurance — every single task that you could possibly think of that a show would entail is left up to road and tour management.”</p><hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Justina Omokhua: the company director</h2><p>Previously a director at mega talent agency Endeavour, which merged with the William Morris Agency in 2009, Omokhua was hired as senior vice president at Parkwood Entertainment production company ahead of the release of the Renaissance album last year. </p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Before Endeavour she was head of global content at Apple, helping grow subscriber numbers at Apple Music. “If you ask around, you will find that her name is synonymous with being a “Fixer,” wrote Elle in 2012 – a quote Omokhua liked so much she put it on her Instagram.</p><hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Ty Ty Smith, the trusted confidante</h2><p>Smith is a lifelong friend of Beyoncé’s husband Jay Z. They grew up together in a hard-knock Brooklyn neighbourhood and together co-founded the Roc Nation management company, owned by the all-powerful Live Nation and with a roster that includes Rihanna, Alicia Keys and Christina Aguilera. He is godfather to Jay-Z and Beyoncé’s three children, Blue Ivy, Sir and Rumi. Such is the friendship between Beyoncé and Jay-Z are believed to have asked Smith to look after their three children should anything happen to them.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal\">The old guard</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Lee Anne Callahan-Longo: the manager</h2><p>Longo was Bey’s manager for 10 years but departed Parkwood in a 2016 boardroom shake-up. At the time, the Beyoncé camp insisted there was no bad blood. “Lee Anne Callahan-Longo has worked with Beyoncé for the last 10 years. Their friendship supersedes business, and while she is no longer an employee of Parkwood, she will remain an imperative part of Beyoncé’s life.”</p><p>But the speculation was that Beyoncé wanted to take things “to the next level” and so had replaced many key people within her organisation “Beyoncé basically cleaned house, got rid of her whole team…and hired a new team,” reported the New York Post.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>“She wants to surround herself with business people who could take her career to an even higher level. She has one album left to deliver before her deal is up with Columbia, plus she wants to make smarter decisions where it comes to touring, sponsorships and acting roles.”</p><p>Longo’s replacement came straight from the corporate world. Steve Pamon was the former JP Morgan Chase head of sport and entertainment. But he had previous with the Carter family, having arranged for Morgan Chase to sponsor Jay Z and Beyoncé's 2014 On The Run tour.</p><hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Zerina Akers: the stylist</h2><p>Akers's big break came when she worked with Beyoncé on her 2017 ‘visual” album, Lemonade (each track having its own video). For the song Formation, she put Beyoncé in an oversized top hat that obscured her eyes and which became instantly meme-worthy (the hat later fetched £20,000 at a charity auction).</p><p>She continued working with Beyoncé until the summer of 2022 before stepping away. “She became so many different women as we’ve watched her since being in the group, going independent and becoming a mother,” Akers said of her time with Beyoncé. There’s so many different versions of her, but how can I, as a stylist, find that new version? Find that new woman? What silhouettes can we explore that she hasn’t before?”</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Janet Rollé: the executive</h2><p>Beyoncé formed Parkwood in 2010 and Rollé was a prime move during the entertainment group’s early years. She left in 2012 to take over as chief executive of American Ballet Theatre. She had come to Parkwood after senior positions at VH1, HBO and CNN, where she was chief marking officer.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Norman Oosterbroek: the bodyguard</h2><p>Nicknamed the “Dutch Giant”, Oosterbroek was Beyoncé and Jay’z personal muscle for many years – in addition to protecting figures such as Lady Gaga and even Nelson Mandela. But he was fired by the Carters because of his drug use. Desperate, he turned to crime and was fatally tasered by police while attempting to break into a mansion in Miami while naked and under the influence in 2013.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Mathew and Tina Knowles: the parents</h2><p>Knowles had managed his daughter, Beyoncé, through her early career, and was a driving force behind Destiny’s Child, the Bey-led girl group he helped assemble in their home town of Houston. He had cut the line-up to four from six and hustled for a music deal. That initial line-up included Beyoncé’s friend, Kelly Rowland, who had moved in with the Knowles because of family issues. </p><p>He also gave up his job as a medical equipment salesman to focus on securing a record deal for the group. This caused financial difficulties and put strain on his marriage to Beyoncé’s mother, Tina. All the blood, sweat and toil paid off in 1997, when their debut single, No, No, No made the US Top 100 and reached five in the UK singles charts. </p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>However, the relationship eventually soured. Knowles accused Live Nation, the concert giant, of turning his daughter against him and creating a fake rumour that he had embezzled money from her tours. Whatever the reason, she fired him as her manager in 2011 and instead struck a deal with her husband’s Roc Nation group. </p><p>She remains close to her sister Solange and to her mother, Tina. Beyoncé took time out from conquering live music this week to wish Tina Happy Mothers Day. “I love you so much Mama and I’m so grateful for all you do for me,” she wrote on Instagram. The adoration flowed both ways  “This audience is the best yet !!! Love them !!!” Tina wrote of the crowd at her daughter’s show in Brussels. This confirmed reports that Tina was on the road with her daughter. </p><p>Tina’s relationship with Beyoncé’s father is rocky. She divorced Mathew the same year Beyoncé cut business ties with him and later married actor Richard Lawson. Tina had also played a key part in the early story of Destiny’s Child, designing and making their onstage outfits because of financial necessity. </p><p>She and Lawson went on to appear in the video to All Night from Lemonade, in an image from their wedding day. Mother and daughter remain close, with Beyoncé saying Tina has helped give her a healthy perspective about wealth and fame. “My mom has always told me that beauty fades,” she said. “But inner beauty is forever.”</p>\n",

At the same time, the dividend allowance dropped from £2,000 to £1,000, and will also halve again to £500 next year.</p><p>It means thousands of taxpayers will need to fill in a self-assessment form for the first time ever. This will result in an extra 240,000 taxpayers with a late filing penalty next year, a report by the stockbroker AJ Bell has warned.</p><p>More than a million people had to pay extra interest on late tax in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 tax years, a Freedom of Information request by AJ Bell found.

      "<p>Laura Suter, of the broker, said around one in 10 people expected to file a tax return were asked to pay interest on their late payments.</p><p>“With the tax-free allowance on capital gains and dividend taxes being dramatically cut in the next year, more people will have to file a tax return for the first time in their lives,” she said.</p><p>“On top of that, those who earn more than £100,000 must file a return, as well as those who have hit the child benefit high-income charge and people who have other sources of income from their main job.”</p><p>Ms Suter added that some would struggle to complete the return or even realise that they had to fill one in. “This represents a huge cash cow for the Government, who whack fees and charges on top of the tax owed,” she said.</p><p>Last week, HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) increased its late tax payment charge to 6pc. Meanwhile, those owed money by the taxman are paid a rate of just 3.5pc on their money. The gap is because of a rule that allows HMRC to charge 2.5 percentage points above the Bank Rate, and pay 1 percentage point below it to a minimum of 0.5pc.</p><p>Anyone can be hit with a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tax/news/what-have-do-wrong-land-big-bill-hmrc/\">late filing penalty if they miss the deadline</a> for filing their tax return or paying their bill. If your tax return is one day late, HMRC charges a penalty of £100.</p><p>Once you are more than three months late, it charges £10 per day up to a maximum of 90 days. This continues to rise to a maximum of £300 or 5pc of the total tax due, whichever is higher.</p><p>These penalties are on top of late payment interest charges.</p>\n",

      "<p>Ms Suter noted that some taxpayers can get these fees waived, but only if they meet a specific list of excuses from the taxman. “Simply not knowing that you needed to file a return or not understanding how to do it is not enough.</p><p>“You only get a refund if you have things like illness or a relative’s death that prevented you from filing, or your computer breaking when you were sending your return,” she said.</p><p>HMRC was approached for comment.</p>\n",

      "<p>Andrew Richardson – the British coach who <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2021/09/11/will-win-world-reacted-emma-raducanus-us-open-final-win/\">steered Emma Raducanu to the US Open title</a> – has revealed that he was let go via a brief phone call from Raducanu's agent <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2021/09/24/emma-raducanu-parts-company-coach-andrew-richardson-just-weeks/\">a couple of weeks later</a>.</p><p>The detail confirms that Richardson did not jump – as was often claimed in the aftermath of her unprecedented triumph. He was clearly pushed, in an unsentimental manner that is entirely typical of the tennis coach's lot.</p><p>In the autumn of 2021, a number of vocal social-media accounts kept claiming that Richardson was more interested in coaching his own talented son Rocco – who is now 14 – than in following up on the extraordinary scenes that unfolded in New York.</p><p>Insiders suggested at the time that this was not the case, and that Richardson had hoped to negotiate a new deal, only to be rebuffed. But with the man himself rejecting all interview requests, the point remained moot.</p><p>Now Richardson has finally put that theory to rest. \"The fact of the matter is that I had a nine-week trial contract that both Emma and I thought was a good idea to see how we would get on,\" <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-12083065/I-got-brief-phone-call-Andrew-Richardson-opens-split-Emma-Raducanu.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailsport\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">he told the Daily Mail</a>. \"It ran through to the end of the US Open, stopping immediately afterwards.</p><p>\"There was a period of time after that when I was keen to re-negotiate the contract. I wanted to carry on, and I had a plan that I wanted to put in place for Emma. This thing about 'I wanted to go off and coach my son' is not true, but it seems to come up all the time.</p><p>\"After probably 10 days to two weeks [since the US Open] I didn't have a contract. We were in the process of re-negotiating and then I got a brief call from her agent telling me they were going to go in a different direction, and that was the end of it.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>A 6ft 7in left-hander who reached the world's top 150 in 1997, Richardson is remembered as a player with a big game and bags of potential. Yet his genial character may not have lent itself to the cut-throat nature of elite tennis.</p><p>His personality is perhaps better suited to coaching, and he has indeed taken a closer role in his son Rocco's development of late. Soon after splitting with Raducanu, Richardson accepted a job as the head coach of the David Ferrer Acadamy in Spain, where Rocco is among the pupils.</p><p>\"There were a lot of family logistics to think about,\" said Richardson about the period after his deal with Raducanu ran out. \"One son was changing schools and I had to find a tennis situation that worked for Rocco and I needed to find a job. Putting all that together was quite complicated, and there were still Covid restrictions around which made it even more tricky.</p><p>\"Any parent with a child who is serious about their tennis will identify with the fact that it can be a complicated business and that a lot of sacrifices have to be made.\"</p><p>Meanwhile Raducanu set out on what has been a bumpy road since her US Open triumph. Her win percentage is running at a touch under 50 in that time, but the biggest issue has been a lack of matches: just 51 in more than a year-and-a-half. She is currently recovering from wrist surgery (see below).</p>\n",

      "<p>As for coaches, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2022/10/27/emma-raducanus-16-month-revolving-door-coaches/\">there was a sense of instability last year</a>. Torben Beltz followed Richardson but left in April, whereupon a hiatus ensued. Jane O'Donoghue – a childhood mentor now working for the Royal Bank of Canada – provided informal support at Wimbledon.</p><p>Dimitry Tursunov then arrived in the late summer, only to depart with a parting shot about \"red flags\". Raducanu hired the German Sebastian Sachs at the end of last year, but is now facing a lengthy lay-off after undergoing operations on both wrists and one ankle this month.</p>\n",

We’ve done some research which has shown that the higher the front section of the bra, the more support it provides – so that’s a good thing to look out for,\" says Wakefield-Scurr. \"‘Encapsulation’ designs also tend to support the breast better than bras that just compress the breast tissue towards the chest wall – so look for something that has separating cups in it.\"</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How to choose a sports bra</h2><p>If you’re starting from scratch, having a fitting either in person or virtually with a brand such as MAAREE (more on that below) is the first step to finding the most supportive sports bra. </p><p>Don’t think you can get away with a flimsy crop top if you’re doing low impact exercise, either; a supportive sports bra is important regardless of what workout you’re doing. “There are sports bras especially designed for low-impact exercise that allow more of a range of movement in your upper body,” which is important for sports like yoga and pilates, says Wakefield-Scurr.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How we tested the best sports bras </h2>\n",

But this MAAREE bra – my long-time favourite, so I'm biased – was as close as it got. The brand was founded by a former lab-based sports bra tester, Mari Thomas; with many years of research under her belt, MAAREE was designed to be the answer to every woman's common sports bra woes. </p><p>The Solidarity bra is fully adjustable with straps that transform it into a racerback bra and a clever 'overband' that minimises upward movement. It has a high-coverage design for optimal support. Our testers said it was \"so comfortable and light it felt it had been custom made,\" and praised its perfect fit. Personally, it's the only one I would wear for running, as the clever design means it limits movement in every direction for optimal support. Neamh Randall, the Telegraph's design assistant and a member of the testing panel, said: \"It was the first time I have ever gone for a run without discomfort.\"</p><p>The only downside is that the adjustable straps under the armpit can rub a little if you choose to wear the bra alone without a t-shirt or vest. Other than that, it's a perfect ten. </p>\n",

This is in a similar seamless crop-top style to the Sweaty Betty bra below, but it's a lot cheaper. Testers Kirsten and Katherine both commented on the soft fabric and snug fit – the fact that it's such good value tops it off. </p><p>\"This bra was true to size, fit well and was comfortable when I was cycling – it didn't chafe or rub,\" said Katherine. \"I had to wrestle with it a little to get it on and off but the fabric felt nice on my skin and was breathable.

It's a bit complicated, but wins points for being very size inclusive – the 3X size is equivalent to a 46 F-G. The sizing system is the only con to a long list of pros – we love the smooth fabric of this sports bra and the zero-distraction fit (there are no zips, clips or toggles to get in the way). It's adjustable via velcro straps at the back, so you can personalise the back width. </p><p>For running or high intensity interval training, it wasn't rated as supportive as the MAAREE bra above for larger cup sizes. However, personally I found it far more supportive than expected. The compressive fit keeps everything in place, and the racer-back design offers a great range of movement. Finally, it doesn't hurt that it's a little more affordable than our top choice.</p>\n",

The fabric is super-smooth and laser cut with minimal seams. It can be worn by itself for running and will stay in place with no uncomfortable rubbing or chafing under the arms. </p><p>Our link goes to the new and improved Lululemon Enlite Bra, which now has a zip. Our panel tried the previous iteration without a zip (pictured), which they found to be tricky to get on and off, so we are currently testing the new version.

Telegraph newsletter editor Katherine Lovage, a member of the testing panel, said: \"I liked the unique strap style of this bra, which spread the pressure across my shoulders, stopping any friction or rubbing.

      "<p>Did you know, memory foam was first developed for astronauts? In the 1970s, NASA commissioned scientists to develop a material to cushion astronauts during lift-off and relieve the pressure of g-force. One clever soul quickly realised the material would make a great mattress and with that, memory foam mattresses were born in the 1990s (closely followed by <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/home/best-pillows-luxurious-nights-sleep/\">pillows</a> and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/home/best-mattress-toppers/\">mattress toppers</a>).</p><p>The best memory foam mattresses absorb all motion and relieve pressure, which is why you get a sinking feeling when you lie down on one. “I would recommend a memory foam mattress for people who prefer a firmer sleeping surface, need pressure point relief and want a personalised sleeping experience.

      "<p>Testing mattresses is pretty difficult for one obvious reason - they’re huge. Between our small recommended team at The Telegraph, we simply don’t have enough beds. Instead I called in the advice of experts and spent a week visiting showrooms around London to try as many memory foam mattresses as I could.</p><p>It’s been a tough old week, mostly spent horizontally, but someone’s gotta do it. It’s important to note that the best mattress for each individual varies enormously, based on weight, height, pressure points, sleeping position and whether or not you share a bed. For that reason, I judged the mattresses on more objective criteria: foam density and thickness, number of layers, temperature regulating features, sustainability of materials and, of course, comfort.</p><p>If pain relief is your main reason for buying a new mattress, by the way, you may prefer to read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/home/best-mattress-back-pain/\">best mattresses for back pain</a>.

      "<p>Just like Coca-Cola’s secret recipe (written on a piece of paper kept in a vault in the US), the patented Tempur foam has a secret formula known by less than 10 scientists in the world. It’s the same formula first developed by NASA for astronauts. Tempur got dibs because their sleep scientists were the first to realise how perfect the material would be for mattresses.</p><p>Tempur material is a form of memory foam that’s even better at absorbing and distributing pressure with less motion transfer. Motion transfer refers to how much you feel movement from a different area of the bed - one to focus on if you have a fidgety partner.</p><p>The Original Elite Memory Foam Mattress is Tempur’s medium-firm memory foam option. It has enough of the sinking-in feeling that memory foam is known for but still with a bit of rigidity for support. I also found the Tempur material to be bouncier than usual memory foam, meaning it sprung back into place as I tossed and turned and I didn’t get stuck.</p><p>The obvious drawback to all Tempur mattresses is the price tag, but if you can afford it or don't mind sacrificing a few other niceties to compromise, I say do it.</p>\n",

It's not the cheapest on this list, but I've put it as best value because I do think it's the best quality per pound.</p><p>Buying a new mattress with a partner is never easy, with each requiring different support. One key feature of this mattress is that it can be customised so each half is a different level of firmness.</p><p>The four layers consist of a thin breathable foam layer on top, a thick wad of memory foam, another layer of temperature regulating memory foam and a supportive base.

Fabio Perrotta, director of buying at Dreams says, “We offer varying depths of memory foam mattresses. Often a memory foam mattress is made up of different layers of reflex or comfort foams, combined with layers of pressure relieving memory foam. As well as different depths, there are an array of different densities to achieve different comfort grades.” </p><p>Tempur sells memory foam mattresses that range between 21 and 30cm deep.

This is really different to other MIPS systems (see my FAQ below for explanations of terms like these). Typically, ski helmets have an outer, a firm foam layer (normally EPS) and a soft, padded liner. However, Spherical helmets have two foam layers, with the inner nesting inside the outer layer and connected via MIPS elastomers, where it can rotate and move around like a ball-and-socket.</p><p>Different densities of foam can be used in the foam layers, addressing high and low speed impacts. There’s no hard plastic MIPS layer, and venting can be optimised. This results in an incredibly comfortable helmet with enhanced safety. When you’re wearing it, you don’t feel the outer moving around, just superb hold. The fit system has a dial for a snug fit around your head, that can be vertically tuned to ensure it sits perfectly on your head.</p><p>The hybrid shell has a durable and tough hard shell on the top, with adjustable venting. The lower sections are in-mold to keep weight down, with a protective layer on the bottom edge.</p><p>A fixed peak adds some style and protection from inclement weather and the magnetic buckle is easy to use with gloves or mitts on.</p>\n",

      "<ul><li>Outer – Hybrid</li><li>Adjustable venting – Yes</li><li>Magnetic buckle – Yes</li><li>Removable earpads – No</li><li>Size ranges 53-62cm</li></ul><p>This visor looks more like a goggle, and you lift the lens out and up to the brim of the helmet to get it out of the way, or pull it down over your face to protect your eyes; it’s a natural movement if you’re used to goggles. (Visors tend to pivot from one point). I tried it with prescription glasses too and they fitted easily. As always, you’d need to try it with yours to ensure they fit.</p><p>In this Plus set, you get two lenses; the colour of these depends on the helmet colour you select. They are magnetic and incredibly easy to change, yet secure when fitted. They have Sigma tech, to boost colour contrast, and I found they give excellent perception of what lies ahead.</p><p>Safety is enhanced through the mould shape of the EPS core, to create foam-topped pads that absorb 30 per cent more shocks. EPP foam is used in the front and rear to again boost energy absorption. While not MIPS, this design can reduce the severity in angled impacts.</p><p>The outer is durable ABS hard-shell up-top, with adjustable venting, combined with in-mold down low at the rear. A BOA dial uniformly adjusts the fit around your head and the ear pads are really comfy.</p>\n",

This is aided by the sublimely soft microfleece liner inside, which extends quite low at the back, to help keep the elements at bay. The fit system is awesome, as the BOA dial cinches a front and rear cradle, fully wrapping all over your head.</p><p>The visor mechanism is unusual too. The lens has quick-release clips, for rapid changes if you get a spare lens (a coin, or similar, can make this easier), but the real beauty is that it’s attached to the helmet on an elastic bungee cord. Using it is like using a goggle, and you can hook the visor up on the helmet. It also has a setting to pop it forward a touch if you’re wearing larger prescription glasses.</p><p>The bungee lies inside the helmet core, and is pretty easy to change if it ever gets damaged (I swapped it out, just to check).</p><p>There’s a full wrap around the bottom edge, helping to keep the Rachel looking good for longer.</p><p>There are more expensive options available with MIPS, spare lenses and higher definition lens tech, but this model offers superb value and works superbly well.</p>\n",

There are 21 vents, and you can adjust the upper front and rear vents independently to fine tune the airflow. The fact you can get this in some pretty bright colours is also a plus (makers <a href=\"https://www.smithoptics.com/en_GB/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Smith</a> are known for their sunglasses). A dash of colour is no bad thing and helps ski buddies find you in those busy lift lines.</p><p>Safety is boosted by the addition of the MIPS sliding layer between the EPS liner and the soft inner padding. They also use a honeycomb construction in place of EPS in some areas, to enhance safety. These bonded plastic tubes work like a crumple zone, but also reduce weight and further improve venting.</p><p>The plush padding adds to the comfort, and it has a zippered audio pod compartment for the ears. You can remove the ear pads for those sweltering spring days.</p><p>A BOA dial cinches in the helmet right around your head, rather than just shoving your head forwards, like some. Also available for women.</p><p>Although they don’t state a weight, it is light, coming in under most of its hybrid shell competitors.</p>\n",

In fact, they use this construction in four of their helmets, with the Logan sitting in the middle of the price range but with improved venting over the two cheaper models. </p><p>WaveCel is a collapsible cellular structure that sits close to the head. Like Mips, it helps reduce the rotational force transmitted to the brain from a fall or collision. Unlike Mips, WaveCel also works like a crumple zone, helping to absorb the impact force. It is a mightily impressive construction, backed up with scientific research to ensure it really works, and is becoming more commonplace in sports helmets. </p><p>This is all great when you’re snowboarding (and skiing) but a helmet has to be comfortable. The Logan is a beautifully comfortable helmet, helped by the low weight. The venting is efficient, aided by the cell structure of WaveCel, but you can’t adjust it, so on really cold days you may want to put a beanie under the Logan. Unusually, the BOA is attached to the helmet, rather than the rear cradle, and is therefore even easier to adjust. If you’re measurement sits between sizes, I’d go bigger.</p>\n",

The Four AMID Pro sits close to the head, avoiding that dreaded mushroom look. You can remove the super-comfy liner, along with the goggle strap retainer, if you want to go full freestyle and wear your beany and goggle strap under the helmet. Although, with the liner in, this is very comfortable to wear. </p><p>The memory foam style padding around the head snugs in nicely with the rear-mounted dial, which can be adjusted vertically so you don’t have the dreaded goggle gap. The moulded earpads are soft and can take audio inserts, although if you’re ears stick out a lot (like me) you may feel pressure there.</p><p>The shaping inside the EPS liner improves airflow over the head and acts like a crumple zone in the case of an accident. This works with the dual density foam pillars (AMID foam) to provide up to 40% higher impact protection than industry standards require. This is not MIPS, but is Atomic’s approach to enhance safety and deal with the oblique impact issue. They also include a Recco reflector, for added piece-of-mind.</p><p>The shell is mostly in-mold but there’s a tougher ABS section on the lower area, adding strength and durability.</p>\n",

The weight of a helmet can make a big difference to your skiing, as you may have it on your head for eight hours each day. </p><p>There’s a decent amount of venting in this helmet, although it is fixed, but this has never felt an issue when skiing. </p><p>It may seem an odd thing to focus on, but Scott has invested time and money in the R&amp;D of their earpads.

They’ve added aramid fibre layers (think Kevlar) to help prevent penetration of the helmet. A built-in Recco reflector makes it easier for you to be found by rescue teams.

The outer shell uses variable wall thicknesses in the ABS layer, with laminated carbon inserts under the top sections. This is superbly durable and allows Sweet to optimise the elasticity and rigidity of the shell for the different aspects of the skull.</p><p>The EPS liner takes safety to another level with varying densities of foam, depending on the shape of that section of the head. Under this, there are two sliding MIPS layers; the front is laminated to the soft lining, removing that hard plastic feeling you get with MIPS and enhancing the comfort of this helmet. The rear MIPS layer is separate to the soft inner, in that classic yellow MIPS hard plastic.</p><p>The removable earpads have a zippered opening to accept audio inserts. They have a foam surround that your ears sit inside making these so comfortable. I find you don’t get that compressed feeling you get with some earpads. The magnetic buckle is also one of the easiest to use with gloved hands.</p><p>The new Trooper doesn’t lose the superb aesthetic it’s famous for, and offers incredible safety. It’s so comfortable and confident – inspiring you to want to ski better every day. The fact they use this for World Cup racing reflects its pedigree.</p>\n",

A magnet on each side of the visor helps to locate the helmet mount, and a spring-loaded catch secures it in place. Levers on either side of the helmet means you can adjust how close the lens is to your face; great for prescription glasses. It takes a little practice, and it’s always worth testing that it’s fully secured, but it’s pretty easy once you’ve got the hang of it. A second set of mounts above the brim allows you to fix the lens up, off your face, like a goggle.</p><p>You can wear this with normal goggles, instead of the visor, and I tested this with various brands. Although there’s no strap retainer it still worked well. </p><p>The MIPS layer has a grid of triangular holes and the EPS liner has channels and cut-outs, improving airflow. A massive sliding panel on the top is easy to close off the top vents with gloved hands. The removable earpads are again thoughtfully designed with poppers on the strap slider; a welcome addition to keep things securely in place.</p><p>I should note that I tested the medium, which is 55-59cm. It’s tighter than some helmets this size, but I’m 58cm and it worked fine. The large size for the MOD 7 is 59-61cm, not the 59-63cm shown on the size chart on Oakley’s site.</p>\n",

The Ryft venting system is incredible. The panel moves down to allow masses of air in, but doesn’t slide, so the protection from penetration in a fall is preserved. It’s adjustable so you can ride with it open or closed.</p><p>The outer is hard shell on the top and in-mold around the rear, with a strong lower edge protector. Removable audio-compatible earpads, the added safety of MIPS, a BOA dial to tune the fit and a magnetic buckle are all great to have.</p><p>For me, the visor in this helmet is the main point to talk about though. It delivers superb optics, and is photochromic, meaning that it darkens for those bright, sunny days and lightens as the clouds move in. However, photochromic lenses typically can’t lighten when it’s really cold, posing a problem for skiers. </p><p>We often encounter really cold conditions with poor visibility, such as those feared white-out days. The Phantom lens technology means the photochromic nature of this lens is preserved, even down to below -20°C. The transition speed from light to dark is also quicker than many other light-sensitive lenses. It’s really impressive in use.</p>\n",

Unusually, you get two sets of soft, inner liners. The liner that comes fitted is their lighter-weight X-Dry liner, which is great at wicking when you’re putting the effort in. The other is a fleecy affair delivering luxurious warmth for those frigid mid-winter days. You also get two sets of removable earpads to match, which are completely removable if you prefer to ride without them.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.marker.net/en\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Marker</a>'s Adaptive Polymer is a memory foam-like padding. This is used in targeted areas of the EPS liner, to absorb multiple impacts, improve overall comfort and better protect the more vulnerable areas of the head. The MIPS layer helps reduce trauma from rotational impacts. </p><p>The EPS core has a hard ABS shell material up top, which houses the adjustable venting. PC in-mould construction is used around the sides and rear, helping to keep the weight down. A tough bumper material is placed around the bottom edge to look after the EPS liner when the helmet’s laid down.</p><p>This is a lovely helmet to ski in, and the dial adjustment cinches right around your head.

The soft liner is very comfortable, including over the ears. The earpads are not designed to be removed for skiing but you can take them out for washing.</p><p>While MIPS is a brand name, famous for helping to reduce rotational impact forces, Shred has its own tech to deal with oblique falls. It offers a very similar movement between the head and helmet to MIPS, without the need for a hard plastic layer. They pair this with honeycomb structures inside the EPS layer, improving how loads are dissipated, and further enhancing safety.</p><p>If you also race slalom gates, this helmet is a great option as you can attach Shred’s Soft-Ear Chin Guard.</p>\n",

      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal\">FAQ</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">What is the difference between a ski and snowboard helmet?</h2><p>There is no difference. It can be easier to think about these as snow-sports helmets, rather than ski or snowboard. There are some brands that are more popular with skiers and some more desired in snowboarding, but there’s no fundamental difference. They all need to meet certain standards: EN 1077 is the European norm, ASTM F2040 for America and, following the UK leaving the EU there’s a UKCA 2016/425 standard.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">What are ski helmets made of?</h2><p>Almost all helmets have a core of expanded polystyrene (EPS) although some have expanded polypropylene (EPP). They’re different types of foam but still act as the main cushioning layer between your head and anything it collides with.</p><p>Outside of this core is the shell. There are three main shell types: hard shell, in-mold and hybrid. A hard shell is as it sounds, with a tough hard plastic sitting outside the foam core. This outer is normally made of ABS plastic, the same material as Lego, and is very durable but can be heavier. In-mold helmets have a thin layer, normally polycarbonate (PC), bonded to the foam core. This type of helmet can be far lighter than a hard-shell and have a lot of venting although, unlike hard shell helmets, the venting is normally non-adjustable. Hybrid helmets use a combination of these constructions.</p><p>Helmets also have a soft, fabric lining that helps to wick away moisture, adds warmth and enhances comfort. These can be removed and washed on most helmets, including all of the helmets featured here.</p><p>Adjustable fit tension is really important, and all the helmets mentioned above have a dial adjuster to take tune how snug the helmet is. BOA is a brand of dial, using cables, but own-brand dial systems can work equally well.</p><p>Many helmets now have magnetic buckles. These are really easy to use and very secure. They can be a lot easier to fasten and release than a regular click buckle that you need to squeeze to release.</p><p>When selecting a helmet for your sport(s), think about what you will be doing. If you’ll be just riding about resort and you often get cold, then having venting you can close and good padding inside can help. If you hike for lines and get hot, then having something with lots of venting can be a real benefit. If you like to listen to music, then having audio-ready earpads is great, as you can slide little purpose-built headphones inside the earpads, although these are normally something you have to buy separately.</p><p>If you ski or snowboard in the warmer spring or summer months, then having removable earpads can be a benefit. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How do I know the helmet fits?</h2><p>The helmet should be easy to put on, not cause undue pressure anywhere and it shouldn’t move around on your head as you move.</p><p>Helmets come in a variety of sizes, with each size catering for a range of 3-5cm. The ranges given above show the total range of head sizes each model caters for. To find out your head size, hold a piece of string 1-2cm above your eyebrows, wrap it around the lump at the back of your head and back to your forehead. Mark where the end meets and measure this. That will give you an idea of your head size. We’ve all got a unique shape to our head, so the measurement is just a starting point, and trying a range of helmets on can really prove invaluable.</p><p>When you try the helmet on, fasten it up, tighten the size adjuster and shake your head a little. The helmet should move with your head. You also should not be able to force the helmet off the back or front of your head when the chin strap is fastened.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How often should I change my ski or snowboard helmet, and how do I store it?</h2><p>A new helmet can be a sizeable investment, so you want it to last. It is worth noting though, that if you have a big impact on your first outing then you may need to change the helmet. That is about the worst-case scenario though. If the helmet never suffers any impact and is well looked after, then most manufacturers recommend changing it every 3-5 years. They’ll state this in the documents that come with the helmet you buy.</p><p>If you do have a small knock, then check the helmet over. Look for dints, compressions or cracks. You can also flex the helmet a little to see if there are any cracks, but take care not to stress it as you could cause other damage. If you’re unsure, then visit a ski shop where they can help you.</p><p>Storage should be out of direct sunlight and away from heat sources. Just make sure the helmet and liner has been thoroughly dried before you put it away between seasons. The same when skiing, air the helmet and help it to dry overnight, but don’t put it close to a heat source.</p><p>Lofts can get really hot in the summer and garages or sheds can suffer from moisture. Somewhere inside the house, such a wardrobe or cupboard, can be a great storage location. Just make sure there’s nothing sharded and that things don’t rest on top of the helmet. Most helmets come with a helmet bag, so it can be a great idea to store the helmet and goggles in the same bag, so keep them organised.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">What is MIPS?</h2><p>MIPS stands for Multi-directional Impact Protection System and is a branded technology. This is normally a plastic layer that sits between the EPS foam layer and the soft fabric lining of the helmet. The plastic layer is attached to the EPS layer with rubber fasteners that are under a little tension. MIPS is designed to allow a little rotational movement of the shell and EPS liner on impact, to reduce the force on the brain. There has been a lot of research into the issue of rotation from oblique (slanted) impacts. </p><p>MIPS is just one brand name though, and some manufacturers have other technologies to help deal with the same problem.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that MIPS is about reducing rotational forces and does not necessarily deal with direct impacts. This is one of the roles of the EPS foam layer, and other technologies.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">What is Recco?</h2><p>Recco is a technology used in lots of skiing and snowboarding applications. It is comprised of a little electronic device, called a reflector, and a large detector that is used by rescue teams. Manufacturers can install the reflector in many types of clothing and hardware, including helmets. It does not need charging or any sort of power source. It is designed to help rescue teams locate the reflector, and the person, if they get caught in an avalanche. It can also be used in certain situations to locate people that have got been lost, even if it’s not an avalanche situation.</p>\n",

      "<p>Northwest Syria is the last territorial outpost of the Syrian Revolution and its quasi-independence is a source of irritation for the regime of President Bashar Assad, whose goal is to enforce his government’s rule over the whole of Syria again. </p><p>What protection the northwest had is being eroded at speed as the United Arab Emirates welcomed Assad to Abu Dhabi in March, and Jordan, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia have indicated a willingness to resume diplomatic ties with Damascus. On Sunday, the Arab League began the process of allowing Syria back into the fold. </p><p>Colleagues in northwest Syria have welcomed the United States’ and United Kingdom’s stated opposition to the normalisation of Assad, but question why the US Caesar Act and UK and EU sanctions regimes have not been used to deter those extending the hand of friendship. </p><p>As the Turkish election heads towards a likely run-off, the stakes for northwest Syria could not be higher. Both Presidential candidates have said that Syrian refugees will be returned and suggested that the nature of the Turkish security presence in the enclave could change. </p><p>Turkey hosts some 3.6 million Syrian refugees and has supported them over the past 12 years, but Syrians I met spoke to a change in atmosphere. The environment had become more hostile, with their children being bullied in school and several had applied for visas for other states as an insurance policy, to avoid being returned back to Syria. </p><p>The UK must not abandon Syria. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal\">We must not let them down </h2><p>Cuts to the UK Development budget are being felt in the northwest. Time and again I heard from those I met that the UK was a valued friend but they were increasingly forced to do more with less in the face of soaring demand. </p><p>But, as Minister of State for Development Andrew Mitchell identified, returning to 0.7 per cent is not the whole story. New approaches that reflect the changing world around us are just as necessary. </p><p>Criticism is growing of the Western-led, expeditionary model of humanitarian aid. When making funding decisions, the UK should look beyond the big UN agencies and established International NGOs and diversify to give greater support to locally-led humanitarian organisations. </p><p>Such organisations are better placed to understand the needs of the communities they serve and effect change that is sustainable. It will also better empower civil society leaders, who are frequently a bulwark against more radical players, thus furthering stabilisation goals. </p><p>Local healthcare and humanitarian workers are also uniquely positioned to bear witness to crimes against humanity and have done so at critical junctures of the Syrian conflict, including the chemical weapons attack on eastern Ghouta in 2013 and the siege of eastern Aleppo in 2016.</p><p>Supporting open societies and defending human rights are oft-stated goals of UK foreign, development and defence policy on the basis that these create a more secure global environment. </p><p>The most effective examples of these are found at the community level and the UK should focus on providing targeted support to them alongside the larger UN agencies and INGOs. </p><p>UK diplomacy and aid cannot deliver open societies, but as former DfID staffers Graham Teskey and Tom Wingfield state in their 2021 paper, we should understand how power is organised, where the plausible sources of positive change lie, and tuck in behind locally-driven change processes. </p><p>Examples abound in northwest Syria, including UOSSM, the Independent Doctors Association (IDA), the Syrian Board of Medical Specialties (SBOMS) and our friends and long-standing partners at Syria Relief-Action for Humanity. </p><p>Among my meetings in Syria was with a group of women who were leading initiatives to encourage female political participation, among them a lawyer, activist, journalist and pharmacist. Their clear message to me was that they knew best how to reform their society in a way that was authentic and true to their values: “We can do this ourselves. We will find the solutions within, they will not come from outside.”</p><p>Their work and that of Syria’s healthcare workers is an inspiration, but they are vulnerable. Northwest Syria is in danger and the region awaits the outcome of the Turkish elections with trepidation. </p><p>Now is the moment for the UK to assemble a coalition of sympathetic states and organisations to ensure that northwest Syria is not abandoned to its fate. Those living there have endured enough and have despite all they have encountered created networks and institutions that are serving the people. </p><p>A future political settlement must include security guarantees for northwest Syria, no compulsory return of refugees and the preservation of unconditional humanitarian access to Turkey regardless of any Syria-Turkey rapprochement. </p><p>We must not let them down. </p><ul><li><em>Elly Nott is CEO and Co-Founder, David Nott Foundation</em></li></ul><p><em><strong>Protect yourself and your family by learning more about </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/\"><em><strong>Global Health Security</strong></em></a></p>\n",

The main thing is to make sure the goggles work for your face shape. If you ski or snowboard in a helmet, try the goggles on with that, to make sure they work together.</p><p>If you wear prescription glasses when skiing, it’s essential you try the goggles on over the glasses (look out for OTG ready models).</p><p>It's easy to fall into the trap of getting a goggle your friend loves. We're all unique, so a tint that works for them may not be the best solution for you. Again, trying the lenses out can let you know if your eyes like the lens colour of not. Walk around the store, look at the lights, into darker areas, look out of the window; this all helps to assess how comfortable your eyes are with that lens.</p><hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How I tested the best ski goggles</h2>\n",

      "<p>To get the best possible feel for how well the goggles work, I've been to trade shows, taken goggles apart, tried to get lenses to fall out and out most importantly spent a lot of time skiing in loads of different models over last winter, with a variety of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/leisure/best-ski-helmets-2022-telegraph-ski/\">ski helmets</a>.</p><p>I compared them on fit, colour-enhancement tech, how easy the lenses were to change and whether the goggles could be worn over the glasses (OTG).

      "<ul><li>Small fit</li><li>BirdsEye spherical lens, quick change</li><li>Colour enhancement tech</li><li>Not OTG (over the glasses) ready</li></ul><p>There's no two ways about it, for £290 at full price this is an expensive goggle. But it does come with two incredible lenses, a sturdy zipped protective case, microfibre bag and a GoggleSoc. And since the spare low-light lens alone costs £113, a case is around £30 and GoggleSocs are £15, it's actually cheaper than many of the one-lens competitors when considered as a package. </p><p>The lenses have <a href=\"https://www.smithoptics.com/en_GB/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Smith</a>'s ChromaPop technology. I’d heard such great things from ski buddies that use Smith lenses and found their praise justified; the definition and clarity is superb. </p><p>The beauty with this new version from Smith is the size. I tried the Mag S (for small) but there is a larger version too. Normally, top-end tech like this comes in larger frames, but the S works really well if you have a petite nose, higher cheek bones or just a smaller framed face. </p><p>The lens has a huge field of view, due to the pronounced curve at the bottom and into the sides. Peripheral vision is improved, but the massive benefit was felt when dealing with backpack straps and fiddling with pockets. Levers on the side of the goggle keep the lens firmly locked in, with magnets around the edge so lining the replacement lens is a cinch with gloved hands.</p>\n",

I've long liked the PXV, which is another ace goggle, but the NFX works better for smaller framed faces; I've found it works well for women and younger teens too. The Lumalens Purple Ionized main lens of this looks so good</p><p>You get a spare low light lens in an amber tint in this version. The Swiftlock system has a lever on either side of the goggle to release the lens and this securely locks it back in place. I've never had an issue with Dragon goggles popping off when I stack it. The lens doesn’t have any fixed frame on it, however, so you need to take a little care to avoid fingers smudges when swapping them over, but it's no biggy. </p><p>The Lumalens tech does a stellar job of enhancing colours, contrast and improving depth perception. The thing that I love is how relaxed my eyes feel when using their Lumalens colouring. </p><p>Along with the goggle you get a soft bag, like all goggles, along with Dragon's cool protective soft case.

The full-frame design, with the blue camo colourway is really striking, blending perfectly with the dark blue, silicon lined strap. There's a massive range of colours available if blue's not your thing. </p><p>The larger frame shape works really well for my 58cm head, sitting nicely under the variety of helmets I used without any large gap. The Prizm Sapphire Iridium lens has an amber tint and worked in a broad range of conditions. The Iridium mirror finish keeps glare at bay and Oakley's Prizm technology really helps to pick out details of what's in front of you. </p><p>The Prizm colour tech in the Flight Tracker is tailored specifically for snowsports, resulting in superb clarity and depth perception.  The Toric lens tapers the lens thickness, although it's hard to prove how effective it is.</p><p>The face foam is really comfy, with areas in the sides to accommodate prescription glasses, while the soft, zipped case adds another level of protection when transporting your goggles.</p>\n",

The Factor from <a href=\"https://www.scott-sports.com/gb/en/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scott</a> has a cylindrical shape, which is generally more economical to produce, and you get two layers of face foam, rather than the three of more expensive models, but you don't notice any less comfort and it feels like a premium goggle. </p><p>There's plenty of padding to seal out the elements, the lens remained fog free and the Amplifier solution Scott has developed for handling colour really does work. The photochromic lens darkens or lightens, depending on how much UV light hits the lens. These light sensitive options are excellent, as you don't need to swap out lenses as the weather changes.</p><p>This Bronze Chrome-coloured lens covers categories S1 to S3, so really does cover all the bases. (Scott do another lens option, which looks stunning in the red mirror finish, but this only covers categories S2 to S3.) </p><p>The fit works well on a fairly broad range of face shapes and sizes, although if you want something larger then look at the Shield model (another awesome goggle, in my experience). </p>\n",

While not everyone will want that motocross look, all those I polled when testing this thought the design looked great. I loved the angular styling. </p><p>The Snowcraft uses their HiPer Contrasting Lens technology to filter certain wavelengths of light while boosting those needed, to great effect. The lens is very good at improving definition. They also use a relatively thick 2mm lens for improved impact protection. </p><p>This goggle doesn't have a quick-change lens system, so you need to pull the frame out from the lens and feed a new lens into the slots, but it's still pretty simple to do. This silver mirror lens, and the spare turquoise mirror one, give a fantastic aesthetic. You can get an XL version with a larger frame, which uses the same lenses as the regular size Snowcraft. You get a spare low light lens in the box. Although not a standard tough case, you could use the packaging as a protective case. </p>\n",

If you pop the lens out, it feels like one thicker lens. I was sceptical about this and thought the lens would really suffer from fogging. </p><p>My doubts were swiftly dealt with in some fairly harsh conditions in various locations. It is quite impressive, on-par with a regular two-piece lens. The lens is super easy to swap out too; you squeeze the buttons on each side to release it. It has a thin frame around the edge, making it very easy to handle without causing finger marks. You can then simply pop in the spare low-light option, as the conditions dictate.  </p><p>To be honest though, the HD tech of the main lens is so good I never had to swap out the lens. It is fantastic in a variety of conditions, from pretty sunny, blue-sky days through to overcast, flat light shockers. You don’t get a case, but the goggle bag does have a separate slot to protect the spare lens. It's not too big either working well for medium to larger faces.</p>\n",

Combining the Volt colour tech with a toric-shaped lens in the Torus Volt simply enhances your time in the mountains. The goggle is designed to reduce distortion and stop fogging, and I didn't experience issues with either. </p><p>It is a relatively large frame, with a huge field of view. If you ski with prescription lenses, you can use Bollé's optical insert in the Torus; you’d have to get the prescription lenses made, but a lot of opticians carry Bollé eyewear anyway. </p><p>The lens rating on this ruby lens is category S2, working well in all but the brightest conditions.

I was really impressed with their Contrast Boosting Lens solution, and it really does help in pulling out the differences in the snowpack ahead. </p><p>They also use a semi-polarizing filter to further reduce glare. I skied it in cloudy and bright conditions, shredding ('scuse the pun) into and out of shaded slopes, and you could really feel the benefit.</p><p>It's also a very comfortable goggle, without being too big. It’s rated as a large fit, but actually I find it works on medium to large faces perfectly well. This goggle comfortably sits over prescription glasses and the hydrophobic treatments help limit any issues with snow or moisture build-up. </p><p>If you want something for really bright conditions, then check out the Rarify with their CBL Hero Mirror lens, as this blocks a greater proportion of light from getting through the lens.</p>\n",

S1, so you are good to go, whatever the weather. </p><p>To swap the lenses, there's a little button to up-top to release the locking mechanism.

      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal\">FAQ</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">What is the difference between a ski and snowboard goggle?</h2><p>As with helmets, there is no difference between a ski and snowboard goggle. There are brands and aesthetics that are more popular with one style of sliding down a snowy slope, but function and technologies aren't unique to one or the other.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">What should I look out for when choosing a goggle for skiing or snowboarding?</h2><p>Goggles come in many different shapes and fits, so make sure you try the goggles on before you buy them. You should feel the face foam contacting all around. If there's a gap, such as around the bridge of your nose, then you'll get a lot of air in and it won't work optimally or be as comfortable. </p><p>You also don’t want to feel too much pressure from the frame. If you're going to be using them with a helmet, then try them on with your helmet. If you rent a helmet, then ask the shop if you can try the goggles on with a few different helmets, to make sure you don't get that nasty gap between goggle and helmet (modern goggles integrate really well with a range of helmets, so it’s not normally a big issue). </p><p>The goggle strap should have silicon beading around the inside, which helps to keep the strap in place the helmet or over your beanie. All of the goggles featured here have this.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Is there a difference between women's and men's goggles?</h2><p>Goggles are unisex. There are colours that may be preferred by some men or women, and often a larger frame works better for larger men, and smaller framed goggled can be preferred by women, but they're not just for women or men. Go for what works for your preferences and face shape.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How do I look after my goggles?</h2><p>Goggles can get finger marks on the lens or damp from sweating or fresh snowfall. All of the goggles here come with a soft microfibre bag to protect them when not being worn. This bag is also used to clean the lens. </p><p>If there are finger marks, you can wipe thee way easily, and sometimes breathing onto the outer lens can help. If the goggles get covered in snow, just take care so no harsh snow crystals scratch the lens.</p><p>Lenses can also get scratched when attached to your backpack, such as when hiking, or gondolas and ski lifts. I am massive fan of GoggleSoc. This is a little protective cover, elasticated around the edge, that slips over your goggles to protect them when not on your face. It also works as a lens cleaning cloth. It then easily stores in a pocket for skiing. They also make them for visor lenses, if you prefer visors (check out our Best Ski Helmets for 2022 for visor helmets).</p><p>If your lenses get iced up on the outside, let this melt before trying to clear the lens. If you get snow inside the goggle, it can be very tempting to wipe this away. Don’t do this. Moisture can soften the excellent anti-fog coating on the inner lens, and you can damage this if you wipe it when wet. </p><p>Instead, tap the goggle against your leg or hand to clear the snow out. Then let it air dry as much as possible, such as while having lunch. This can also be why it's handy having more than one lens, so you can swap one out if it gets wet.</p><p>Air dry your goggle each night between ski days. Avoid putting them on a radiator or directly next to a heat source. Always allow your goggles to air once you get back home from your trip, and store them in their microfibre bag. Some goggles come with a protective case. This is superb for transporting and storing your goggles, once they're dried.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">What colour lens is best for skiing?</h2><p>Goggle lenses come in a vast array of colours and tints. Darker tints are better for brighter conditions, as they let less light through the lens (lower VLT, see next FAQ point). A lighter tint, or even a clear lens, lets more light through and is better when it's really cloudy, snowing or when night skiing.</p><p>The actual colour of the lens ranges from really dark greys and browns, through amber, rose, blue, yellow and clear. There's a massively broad range, even within these, so again this is why trying the goggles on is super important. Some people really like an amber lens, others prefer a yellow colour when it's cloudy, while for many this just isn't comfortable and a rose may work better. </p><p>This is why trying the goggles on in a shop absolutely makes a difference. Walk around the shop, where the lights are bright, where there's more shadow, look out of the windows. You can quickly tell if your eyes are relaxed in a certain lens. If the goggle comes with more than one lens, try them both on, to make sure your eyes are happy.</p><p>Modern lenses now often have superb colour handling. Each brand can have a different way to solve this problem, but the result is excellent depth perception, boosted contrast and an easier time in differentiating between changes in snow.</p><p>Essentially, brands are looking to filter out wavelengths of light that don't help, and enhance wavelengths, therefore colours, that do help us. Brands have their own name for their solution, such as Oakley Prizm, Bollé Volt, Scott Amplifier, Smith ChromaPop and so on.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">What is VLT in ski goggles?</h2><p>VLT stands for Visual Light Transmission and lets you know how much light can get through the lens, given as a percentage. The lower the VLT, the less light permitted through, and the darker the lens will seem. A higher VLT lets more light through and works great when you have those dreaded flat-light days. I've not stated the VLT for each goggle, as it will change depending on the lens you go for.</p><p>VLT is not a rating of stopping harmful UV light though. All of the goggles here protect against damaging UV light. Check the goggle packaging to ensure it states 100% UV protection, or is rated as UV 400.</p><p>Lenses, as with sunglasses, are also split into 5 categories from 0 to 4.  Lenses for snowsports have an S before the number, so a cat. S1 lens is designed for use in snowy terrain and lets quite a lot of light through. Cat. S4 is the darkest option, for really bright, sunny days. The majority of snowsports goggles have a category S2 or S3 lens, working for typical winter conditions you get in the mountains.</p><p>You can also get photochromic, or photochromatic, lenses. These lenses automatically change how light or dark they are, depending on how much UV light hits the lens. Some cover only a couple of categories, such as S2-S3, while others have a greater range, covering 3 categories. Photochromic lenses don’t change tint instantly but over a minute or so.</p><p>It's also important to note that the majority of photochromic lenses won't go their lightest tints when it's really cold; it's just a limitation of how they work. This is why some photo lens goggles come with a spare low-light lens.</p><p>If you ski in sunny conditions then you may be looking at polarized lenses. You don't get many polarized goggles as it can make picking out the difference between soft and hard snow, or ice, more challenging. Some brands use a semi-polarized filter to help deal with this problem.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Do goggles work with prescription glasses?</h2><p>If you’re a glasses wearer, look for goggles that are over-the-glasses ready. These will state OTG on their info. We've included this in the info for each of the goggle above, to help you.</p><p>OTG goggles typically have a notch in the frame design, which permits the face foam to squash out of the way of the legs of the glasses, without letting a load of cold air in. It is best to try to the goggles on over your glasses, to make sure they work together. You may well find your glasses will be 'held' by the goggle when you take the goggle off; this is totally normal.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">What is the difference between a cylindrical, spherical or toric lens shape?</h2><p>Goggle lenses come in various shapes. The classic design where it's flat vertically but curved around your face, side to side, is called cylindrical (like it's been formed around a cylinder). This is an old school way of shaping lenses but very contemporary in their look. Modern lens construction techniques mean these lenses offer far less distortion than their ancestors.</p><p>Spherical lenses have a curve in both directions, up and down and side to side, like the lens has been cut from a sphere. This is closer to the shape of your eyeball so can offer excellent vision. The lens also sits further way from your face, so some find you get reduced fogging with a spherical lens.</p><p>Toric lenses are a relatively new development in snowsports goggles. There a few ways to make toric lenses. Some brands tailor the thickness of the lens in different areas, while others focus on the curvature of the lens, and there may a blend of both techniques. </p><p>The easiest way to picture a toric lens can be to imagine a giant o-ring, or thin, giant donut. Tilt the ring so it's balanced on one thin side, with the hole in the middle, side to side. Take a small goggle lens section out of the edge closest to you; this will have a pronounced curve side to side in the lens, but the vertical curve will be much flatter. Toric lenses can provide an incredible field of view and the best distortion-free optics.</p>\n",

Bride prices are widespread across much of South Asia. </p><p>However, in recent years payments have hit all-time highs – averaging $20,000 in some provinces – and making marriage increasingly unaffordable. </p><p>Concerned about China's first population drop in six decades and its rapidly ageing population, officials are introducing <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/03/27/brainless-policy-introduced-china-reverse-low-birth-rate/\">a raft of policies</a> to usher in a “new era” of marriage and childbearing.</p><p>Local governments have begun rolling out propaganda campaigns instructing unmarried women not to compete with one another in demanding the highest prices. Some town officials have imposed caps and directly intervened in private negotiations between families, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/26/world/asia/china-crackdown-bride-prices.html\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p><p>In Daijiapu, a town in southeast China, officials recently gathered women at a local civic building to sign a public pledge to reject high “bride prices”. A sign hung at the front of the room read: “Symposium of unmarried young women of the right age.”</p><p>The local government, describing the event on its website, said it hoped people would abandon such backward customs and do their part to “start a new civilised trend”.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal\">Egg freezing and IVF</h2><p>Cutting bride prices is just one of the projects that China’s Family Planning Association, a national body that implements the government’s population and fertility measures, is trialling in more than 20 cities in a bid to grow the nation’s population. Another will encourage parents to share child-rearing responsibilities. </p><p>Earlier measures introduced by Chinese provinces include tax incentives, housing subsidies, and free or subsidised education for having a third child.</p><p>In March, the government’s political advisers proposed that single and unmarried women should have access to egg freezing and IVF treatment, among other services to boost the country’s fertility rate.</p><p>“The society needs to guide young people more on the concept of marriage and childbirth,” demographer He Yafu told the Global Times.</p><p>However, the campaign has drawn criticism, with commenters on Chinese social media platforms questioning why the burden of solving the problem is falling on women.</p><p>Recent fertility-boosting measures have also failed to deliver, with some women saying the policies do not effectively address the expense of childcare. Meanwhile, many women have decided against having children due to societal pressure to stop their careers.</p><p>China implemented a rigid one-child policy from 1980 until 2015 – the root of many of its demographic challenges that have allowed India to become the world’s most populous nation. The limit has since been raised to three children.</p><p><em><strong>Protect yourself and your family by learning more about </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/\"><em><strong>Global Health Security</strong></em></a></p>\n",

The western state also has the most mining leases in the country and the largest geographical area covered by the mining sector.</p><p>The exact number of people suffering from silicosis in Rajasthan is unknown. <a href=\"https://cag.gov.in/webroot/uploads/download_audit_report/2017/Report_No5_of_2017_-_Economic_Sector_Government_of_Rajasthan.pdf\">According to an audit</a> report filed in the Rajasthan assembly in 2018, a total of 7,959 silicosis cases were diagnosed between January 2015 and February 2017. </p><p>In these two years, 449 people died of silicosis in just five districts of Rajasthan. According to the Rajasthan government's official silicosis portal, the state currently has over 48,000 registered silicosis patients, of which more than 31,000 are certified. </p><p>However, experts claim that this figure is much lower than the actual figure because a large number of patients go unnoticed or are wrongly detected.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-normal\">Life expectancy shortened by 20 years</h2><p>Over 2.5 million people<strong> </strong>are employed in mining in Rajasthan, but only informally or without official documents, giving exploitative employees an excuse to disregard vital safety regulations and rules needed to protect workers’ health.</p><p>Indeed, there are no scheduled operating hours or mining safety arrangements to limit workers’ exposure to crystalline silica dust, which can be found in rock, sand, quartz, concrete, and other building materials, and is the cause of silicosis. </p><p>Nor is there access to basic medical care, while those labouring in the mines are paid less than the minimum guaranteed pay.</p><p>“The mine owners don't seem to care, the workers aren't taken for medical check-ups as required by regulations, and safety equipment is a long way off,” says Rana Sengupta, CEO of the Mine Labour Protection Campaign. </p><p> As a result, the average life expectancy of a mining worker in Rajasthan has dropped from 60 to 40 years. </p><p>“Things have gotten worse with current technology because the new machine emits a large amount of dust all at once,” adds Sengupta. “As you can see, the majority of women in villages near sandstone mines are widowed at a very young age.”</p>\n",

      "<p>The misery of the young widows does not end with the loss of their spouses; they have to then undertake the same task that killed their husbands, fathers-in-law and neighbours, as well as convince their children to do the same. </p><p>“Most of these widows are forced to work after their husband's death due to treatment debt,” says Pekham Basu, an assistant professor at Tata Institute of Social Sciences who has spent years researching the ‘mine widows’ of Rajasthan.</p><p>Social taboos, having lost their husbands, make life even more difficult for these women. </p><p>“They leave their house after everyone else in the village leaves, so they arrive late at the site and are paid for half a day,” adds Basu. </p><p>“They also all work and travel together because they feel more comfortable in a group because men dominate the workplace at mining sites. They seek protection in groups and numbers.”</p>\n",

      "<p> Dankuwar, another widow from Budhpura who lost her husband to silicosis a few years ago, said she knew the “implications” of the mines’ “misery,” but insisted “we don't have any other option”.</p><p>“My husband never wanted me to work, but he became bedridden following the diagnosis, so I had no choice,” she adds. “I had planned to keep my sons away from mine, but they have also joined. We live a life in which we work to kill ourselves.”</p><p>Policing and combating silicosis linked to Rajasthan’s mines are difficult tasks. The central government's Director General of Mines Safety (DGMS) is in charge of mine worker welfare, while state governments are in charge of mining allocation. </p><p>However, these agencies have been accused of turning a blind eye to mines that do not submit a “Notice of Opening” and failing to carry out the relevant inspections, which would normally reveal what steps need to be taken by mine owners to ensure the health and safety of workers. </p><p>“During my tenure, there were several instances where the DGMS failed to act despite repeated input from me,” said MK Devarajan, a former member of the Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission. </p><p>“They are not aware of the total number of miners operating in the state and do not wish to be. People in the central government aren’t serious or concerned about human rights; they simply don't want to do anything. It is the DGMS's responsibility to enforce, but it appears unconcerned.”</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Another systematic flaw in the fight against silicosis is that it does not fall under the purview of a single agency or ministry, Devarajan added. “The social justice department handles relief and rehabilitation, whereas the labour department handles disease prevention and control.”</p><p>There have been some attempts to address Rajasthan’s silicosis issue. In October 2019, the state approved a policy that provides immediate financial support of 300,000 rupees to silicosis patients and 200,000 rupees to dependents, as well as a monthly income of 1.5 million rupees to the victim’s widow.</p><p>Yet the policy is flawed. The payments often arrive late, forcing recipients to borrow from other sources in the interim. When the money does arrive, most of this is then spent paying off interest from the other loans. Added to this, the support only lasts for up to a year, depending on the costs of treatment, while many valid applicants are rejected.</p><p>However, according to experts, the biggest challenge in combating silicosis is that it is not classified as a criminal offence or an occupational ailment under the Mines Act of 1952 or the Workmen Compensation Act, but rather as a certified disease.</p><p>Furthermore, systematic mechanisms are in place to prevent compensation and accountability.</p><p>“Technically, because they [the sick miners] can’t prove where they worked, they can’t go to labour court and seek compensation, as is their right,” says Devarajan.</p><p>Until the government provides greater support, the ‘mine widows’ must continue to work to pay off their debts. “My man was killed by this dust,” says Dankuwar. “And it will kill me and my son if we don’t do something about it.”</p><p><em><strong>Protect yourself and your family by learning more about </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/\"><em><strong>Global Health Security</strong></em></a></p>\n",

During her Conservative leadership campaign last summer, Liz Truss proposed a tax break for parents who give up work to care for their children. </p><p>The plan would have allowed couples to transfer their personal tax allowance, which is the amount a person can earn before they start paying income tax. This currently stands at £12,570.</p><p>The policy, which has been scrapped by her successor Rishi Sunak, would have meant that a parent taking time off work for childcare could transfer their allowance to a working member of the household, saving a couple up to £2,514 a year.</p><p>Silve, from Worthing in West Sussex, says it was one of the key reasons he voted for Truss to become prime minister. He transfers 10pc of his personal allowance – the maximum currently allowed – to his wife.</p><p>He believes children that do not spend enough time with their parents tend to be at greater risk of behaviour and societal problems and wanted to make sure his daughter achieves her “full potential”. </p><p>His support also means that his wife Nana can focus on developing her career. She has not had to stay out of work for long after giving birth and is doing some additional training on top of her working hours to improve her future prospects. </p><p>Anne Fennell, of campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, also wants to see the tax system change so that the High Income Child Benefit Charge applies to household income rather than individual income. Once a parent earns over £50,000, child benefit is clawed back at £1 for every £100 earned above this threshold. At £60,000, they must repay the benefit in full.</p><p>This means that a household where both parents earn £49,000 will get child benefit payments, but a sole breadwinner earning £60,000 would not.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">'We're forgotten about'</h2><p>Stay-at-home parents say they feel invisible in a society that does not appear to value the hard work they do raising the next generation. </p><p>Amy, 27, from Norfolk, says she has to stay at home to look after her son because he has severe special needs and there is no nursery setting that is capable of giving him the appropriate level of care – she has to wait until he is in school.</p><p>“I have to stay home with him – I have no other choice,” she says. “So we have to make do on what we have.”</p><p>Even though the Government has <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/free-childcare-30-hours-budget-changes-when-start-who-get/\">announced 30 hours of free childcare to support working parents</a> with children under five, it still would not make a difference to families like hers. </p>\n",

      "<p>The train drivers had not had a pay rise since 2019, he added.</p><p>To qualify for the first 4pc boost the companies would need to commit to drivers adopting new routes faster to help plug gaps in the service and using technology to train new staff more quickly.</p><p>The second year of pay rises would hinge on “the successful conclusion” of talks on reforms which would make drivers scheduled to work on Sundays contractually committed to do so if there was no alternative cover.</p><p>The RDG said this change was vital as leisure travel had rebounded much more strongly than commuter and business journeys and now stands at 116pc of pre-Covid levels.</p><p>The group also required that the control of staff work and training schedules was put “back in the hands of the employers”.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Yet the train drivers’ union said the 8pc offer over two years that would lift the average driver’s salary from around £60,000 to just below £65,000 was insufficient.</p><p>Inflation has largely been in double digits since July last year and remained at 10.4pc in March, the latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows.</p><p>It means the pay offer would still be a considerable pay cut in real terms.</p><p>An RDG spokesperson said: “More strike action is totally unnecessary and will only heap more pressure on an industry already facing an acute financial crisis.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">What about more RMT strikes in the next six months?</h2>\n",

      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">Monday 15 May</h2><p><strong>Steeltown Murders</strong><br/><em>BBC One, 9pm</em><br/>Steeltown Murders is written and directed by old hands of the true-crime genre – Ed Whitmore and Marc Evans, who collaborated on ITV’s Manhunt. This is a similarly solid affair, with all four episodes available tonight on BBC iPlayer. It unspools across two timelines linked by two men, DCI Paul Bethell and Phil “Bach” Rees: in 1973, they are young, ambitious coppers (played by Scott Arthur and Siôn Alun Davies) in Port Talbot hoping to catch the rapist and killer of two teenage girls; almost 30 years later, DNA advances see the case reopened as Bethell (now played by Philip Glenister) wrangles Rees (Gavin &amp; Stacey’s Steffan Rhodri) to follow through on his suspicion that the same man also killed another girl in Neath at around the same time.</p><p>The time jumps are deftly handled, with the 1970s’ policing all about shoe leather, heavy-handed intimidation and hunches exchanged over pints in pubs, versus the technological advances and enlightenment of the 21st century. The murders, as is now customary, take place off screen but, while sensitive and evocative, Steeltown Murders perhaps lacks the narrative drive and tight focus of some other entries in the genre. <em><strong>GT</strong></em></p><p><strong>Succession</strong><br/><em>Sky Atlantic, 2am &amp; 9pm</em><br/>Shiv the scorpion. Tom the snake. With the extended Roy family resembling a clan of apex predators more than ever before, information applied like venom, the election looms alongside a reckoning with Matsson. </p><p><strong>The Stones and Brian Jones</strong><br/><em>BBC Two, 9pm</em><br/>Creative genius and troubled brute: the enigma of Brian Jones remains to some extent impervious to Nick Broomfield’s enquiring mind in this Arena documentary, although the director (who was 14 years old when he first met the music star) convincingly roots the violence, carelessness and neediness in a loveless upbringing (a coda of father-to-son correspondence hammers the point home with interest). Otherwise, it’s a fairly familiar rundown of the history of the Stones, from blues origins through teenage stardom to drugs and dissolution, with some excellent archive footage.</p><p><strong>Without Sin</strong><br/><em>ITV1, 9pm</em><br/>Having been released on ITVX at Christmas, this harrowing four-part drama showcases typically committed performances from Vicky McClure as grieving mother Stella and Johnny Harris as Charles, the man imprisoned for her daughter’s murder. Three years later, Charles has requested a meeting to begin a Restorative Justice process, but when an ulterior motive surfaces, Stella learns that responsibility for the killing was more complex than she had imagined.</p><p><strong>Rescue: Extreme Medics</strong><br/><em>Channel 4, 9pm</em><br/>A welcome return for the series following staff in the Scottish Trauma Network responding to incidents in remote areas. Tonight’s assignments include a rallying accident on Mull and a tumble into a sea loch.</p><p><strong>Abandoned Engineering</strong><br/><em>Yesterday, 9pm</em><br/>A slice of rock ’n’ roll paradise launches the 11th run of this history series, with a visit to George Martin’s AIR Studios on the Caribbean island of Montserrat, site of recordings by The Police, Dire Straits and Duran Duran among others. Elsewhere, there is a vanity project built to a Georgian dictator, an Arkansas cinema with a secret and a Finnish bunker line with grim contemporary resonance. </p><p><strong>The Sky at Night</strong><br/><em>BBC Four, 10pm</em><br/>The astronomy show examines the likelihood of an asteroid strike on Earth and what can be done to mitigate the threat, including human ventures to change their direction. </p><p><strong>The Quiet Man (1952) ★★★★★</strong><br/><em>Film4, 4.05pm  </em><br/>Best known for his sombre Westerns, John Ford turns personal for this wonderful romantic comedy, which was considered a risky venture but went on to win the director his fourth Oscar. It tells the story of a boxer who falls in love with the sister of a bully. The famous grab-and-kiss scene between the smouldering John Wayne and love interest Maureen O’Hara (the “Queen of Technicolour”) also appears in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.</p><p><strong>The Devil Wears Prada (2006) ★★★★</strong><br/><em>Film4, 6.45pm  </em><br/>In this enjoyably catty look at the wild world of fashion journalism, Meryl Streep plays the perfectionist editor of Runway (a thinly veiled Vogue). Emily Blunt delivers a magnificent turn as her uptight assistant, coming apart at the seams; it’s a shame that Anne Hathaway, alone among them, is sappy, playing the junior who beats Streep at her own game. Stanley Tucci brilliantly co-stars as a done-over editor.</p><p><strong>Colette (2018) ★★★★</strong><br/><em>BBC Two, 11.15pm </em> <br/>Wash Westmoreland’s historical biopic sees Keira Knightley play Colette, a woman who marries rakish “literary entrepreneur”, Willy (Dominic West). When he publishes one of her novels under his name to instant success, it lights a wildfire story of literary and sexual emancipation. The biographical details are bruisingly observed, and an excellent Knightley shoots daggers from her characteristic cut-glass cheekbones.</p>\n",

      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">Tuesday 16 May</h2><p><strong>Forensics: The Real CSI</strong><br/><em>BBC Two, 9pm</em><br/>The third series of the fascinating forensics documentary opens with the harrowing account of a young woman who has been abducted and raped. She had been walking home in the early hours of the morning before she was grabbed from behind, threatened with a knife and then dragged into a derelict house. She agrees to undergo a forensic examination at a Sexual Assault Referral Centre (Sarc), which means the race is on to discover any evidence that could lead to a suspect. </p><p>“Our crime scene is the person,” says Sarc manager Natalie Lynch, although they have more luck with a £20 note. The attacker gave it to the victim so he could claim she was a sex worker. The other key piece of evidence is the victim’s description of a man with self-harm scars. We are shown gripping body cam footage of police officers speaking to builders working in the derelict house – only for an officer to notice scarring on one of their arms. He, of course, denies everything, so the next step for detectives is to prove the victim’s story. The street where she was grabbed is not covered by CCTV, but there is a doorbell camera that could prove pivotal. It’s not easy viewing, but a gripping insight into a world so often seen in TV dramas. <em><strong>SK</strong></em></p><p><strong>Waterloo Road</strong><br/><em>BBC One, 8pm</em><br/>After last series’ shock stabbing, the soapy classroom drama returns tonight with tensions running high between pupils and the police. The arrival of new boy Myles (Osian Morgan), an obnoxious troublemaker, doesn’t help. Nor does the return of former deputy head Andrew (Jamie Glover), the old flame of perpetually stressed out headteacher Kim (Angela Griffin).</p><p><strong>MasterChef</strong><br/><em>BBC One, 9pm</em><br/>It’s knockout week. Gregg Wallace is unwell, so MasterChef: The Professionals judge Anna Haugh joins John Torode to whittle down the remaining contestants. Those who survive will be tasked with working under Michelin-starred chef Peter Sanchez-Iglesias during a busy lunch service at Decimo in London.</p><p><strong>Grand Designs: The Street</strong><br/><em>Channel 4, 9pm</em><br/>Building your own home sounds like a dream, but for Nicola from Yorkshire, it turns into a nightmare when the centrepiece of her vision – a grand triangular window – doesn’t fit her build. The third series of the property show also introduces us to Matt and Maryellen, a couple who disagree over the direction of their flamboyant Brazilian-style self-built home.</p><p><strong>In the Name of the Father: Storyville</strong><br/><em>BBC Four, 10pm</em><br/>In 2015, charismatic Rabbi Eliezer Shlomo Schick, the leader of one of the most orthodox Hasidic communities in Israel, died. This engrossing feature-length documentary recounts how, after his death, the community gave way not only to conflict and violence, but to shocking allegations of sexual abuse.  </p><p><strong>Guilt </strong><br/><em>BBC Scotland, 10pm</em><br/>For three series, this Scottish thriller has been one of the sharpest shows on TV – and tonight’s finale is no exception. Mark Bonnar’s cold, calculating Max reaches his zenith with a scheme that would not only make him filthy rich, but screw over Maggie (Phyllis Logan). Also airing on BBC Two on Thursday at 9pm and available on iPlayer. </p><p><strong>Rebekah Vardy: Jehovah’s Witnesses and Me</strong><br/><em>Channel 4, 10pm</em><br/>Rebekah Vardy is best known for her role in last year’s “Wagatha Christie” trial. This documentary, however, is not about that. It is about Vardy’s upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness, a religion that she claims failed to support her through sexual abuse and is failing many others. </p><p><strong>Anna Nicole Smith: You Don’t Know Me (2023)</strong><br/><em>Netflix  </em><br/>Following her death in 2007, aged just 39, model Anna Nicole Smith was known mostly for her second marriage to 89-year-old billionaire J Howard Marshall, and the legal battle that ensued after he died. But years on, the former Playboy covergirl continues to fascinate; this unflinching feature-length documentary explores her life and career through interviews with close friends and never-before-seen archive footage.</p><p><strong>Man of the West (1958) ★★★★</strong><br/><em>Film4, 5.15pm  </em><br/>This Anthony Mann Western is one of the genre’s toughest. Gary Cooper, in what the posters called “the role that fits him like a gun fits a holster”, plays reformed outlaw Link Jones, whose anxious characterisation belies the tagline. Just as Jones has put his past behind him, he finds himself stranded after a train robbery – and forced to seek refuge with his old gang. Lee J Cobb and Julie London are excellent co-stars.</p><p><strong>Moonlight (2016) ★★★★★</strong><br/><em>BBC Two, 11.15pm </em> <br/>Barry Jenkins’s exquisite second film is a three-part story about a boy growing up black and gay in Miami, based on an unproduced play by Tarell Alvin McCraney. The cast are a mix of newcomers and familiar faces, and the tale they tell will hold you and then floor you. A genuinely history-making film – both for its beautiful story and surprise Oscar win, which birthed the infamous, excruciating La La Land moment.</p>\n",

      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">Wednesday 17 May</h2><p><strong>High Desert</strong><br/><em>Apple TV+</em><br/>Patricia Arquette gives a full-throttle performance in this lively new dark comedy set in small town California; she plays Peggy Newman, an addict with a messy past and a problematic present including her jailbird ex, Denny (Matt Dillon), and her strait-laced siblings, who want to sell the family home after their mother dies. On a whim, she decides to become a private investigator, bamboozling Brad Garrett’s world-weary gumshoe Bruce Harvey into giving her a job.</p><p>Much of the comedy in High Desert (created by Nancy Fichman, Katie Ford and Jennifer Hoppe-House, graduates of Nurse Jackie and Miss Congeniality among others) is broad, but there are some whip smart lines; Newman describes herself as “like Mary Tyler Moore on methadone” and, when caught during an illegal high, says: “It’s acid, not drugs.” Arquette has great comic timing yet also captures a woman who has got by on charm but now finds that those around her are running out of patience. Rupert Friend co-stars as Guru Bob, a local ex-anchorman who has rebranded himself as a desert mystic, while Weruche Opia is Carol, Newman’s best friend. The first three episodes drop today, then the final five weekly. <em><strong>VL</strong></em></p><p><strong>Never Ending Murder</strong><br/><em>Amazon Prime Video</em><br/>This four-part docu-series re-examines the disappearance of teenage mother Nicola Payne in 1991 in Coventry through new interviews with her family and detectives; the case remains unsolved.</p><p><strong>Working: What We Do All Day</strong><br/><em>Netflix</em><br/>As a student Barack Obama was much affected by Studs Terkel’s 1974 book Working, which chronicled ordinary people’s working lives, and the former US president narrates this new series about what gets us up every day – from the lowest-paid to CEOs. Obama offers a thoughtful examination of modern US working life, and why there’s less social mobility now than 50 years ago.</p><p><strong>Natural History Museum: World of Wonder</strong><br/><em>Channel 5, 8pm</em><br/>This entertaining behind-the-scenes series continues as we see the museum’s garden transformation project getting under way, and one of its curators painstakingly repairing a 67-million-year-old triceratops fossil with what he jokingly calls “Polyfilla for a dinosaur”.</p><p><strong>Matt Willis: Fighting Addiction</strong><br/><em>BBC One, 9pm</em><br/>In this one-off documentary, Busted bassist Matt Willis talks about his 20-year fight with addictions – and his worries that an upcoming reunion tour may trigger a relapse. His wife, TV presenter Emma Willis, talks eloquently about her fears, while he visits an innovative rehab unit and meets a research team who are studying the differences in the brains of people with addictions.</p><p><strong>11 Minutes: America’s Deadliest Mass Shooting</strong><br/><em>BBC Two, 9pm &amp; 9.50pm</em><br/>Sixty people were killed and hundreds injured in an attack at the 2017 Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas; in Jeff Zimbalist’s four-part documentary we hear from those caught up in the horrific events. In the opening episodes performers, police and some of the 22,000 fans describe being under fire from the nearby Mandalay Bay hotel, and how a Swat team prepared to act. Despite some stoic testimonies, the panic and fear are palpable. </p><p><strong>Kids</strong><br/><em>Channel 4, 9pm</em><br/>The documentary series about teenagers in care in Coventry continues as it follows Bayley leaving his care home and Byron moving away from his long-term foster carers, as they prepare to live independently. </p><p><strong>The Long Arm (1956, b/w) ★★★★</strong><br/><em>Film4, 2.30pm  </em><br/>This police noir is among the finest films of Ealing Studios’s director Charles Frend’s career. It stars Jack Hawkins and John Stratton as a pair of officers who must investigate a dodgy night watchman connected to a string of robberies. But the more they dig, the murkier the case gets, and they’re taken on a wild goose chase around London to solve it. Hawkins followed The Long Arm with a similar role in John Ford’s Gideon’s Day.</p><p><strong>Flight (2012) ★★★</strong><br/><em>Film4, 9pm  </em><br/>Robert Zemeckis’s film, starring Denzel Washington as alcoholic commercial pilot Whip Whitaker, is a long, earnest, sporadically excellent drama. On a routine short-haul flight from Florida to Atlanta, Whip’s plane starts to tumble out of the sky – a dramatic sequence that will turn nervous fliers’ stomachs – and the pilot must fight to save the lives of those on board. Dull in parts, this is nevertheless morally provocative.</p><p><strong>Only God Forgives (2013) ★★★</strong><br/><em>Great! Movies, 10.50pm </em> <br/>Director Nicolas Winding Refn and star Ryan Gosling follow up 2011’s fantastic Drive with another lurid, muscular crime thriller. This time Gosling is Julian, a US underworld criminal in Thailand, who attempts, reluctantly, to avenge his unpleasant brother’s murder, at the behest of his mother (also unpleasant, but played by Kristin Scott Thomas, so who cares). It’s a neon-dunked nightmare that spits in the face of coherence.</p>\n",

      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">Thursday 18 May</h2><p><strong>Rolf Harris: Hiding in Plain Sight</strong><br/><em>ITVX</em><br/>A <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2023/05/09/rolf-harris-itvx-hiding-in-plain-sight-review/\">new two-part documentary</a> about fallen national treasure Rolf Harris begins with footage of the entertainer appearing with Jimmy Savile on Jim’ll Fix It. Knowing what we know now about the terrible sexual crimes committed by both men, it makes for very uncomfortable viewing. But it is also a perfect illustration of why, for decades, both of them were able to prey with impunity on young women and girls, secure in the knowledge that their status as household-name TV stars would protect them. Time and again here victims recall not only the trauma of Harris’s assaults but also being unable to publicly accuse him for fear of being disbelieved and further humiliated, not least because of Harris’s supposedly “harmless” avuncular persona. </p><p>Some of the first episode’s most horrifying moments come from allegations that Harris committed assaults behind the scenes while he was spearheading the 1980s Kids Can Say No! campaign against child sex abuse, and that over the course of years he groomed and repeatedly sexually assaulted a childhood friend of his daughter. The second episode focuses on how Harris’s crimes finally caught up with him. <em><strong>GO</strong></em></p><p><strong>Three Drinkers in Cognac</strong><br/><em>Amazon Prime Video</em><br/>There’s no shortage of travelogues today, as this fun, boozy series – following hosts Aidy Smith, Helena Nicklin and a guest as they drink their way around a region known for its alcohol – returns for a third run. Meanwhile, on Channel 5 at 8pm, Jane McDonald’s tour of Africa reaches Magical Morocco, where she learns the art of haggling in the markets in Marrakesh. </p><p><strong>The Family Stallone</strong><br/><em>Paramount+</em><br/>Hollywood nepotism gets a pumped-up outing as Sylvester Stallone sets out to boost the profile of his family to Kardashian-like levels of fame in this upbeat – and tongue-in-cheek – reality show following their privileged lives in Tinseltown.</p><p><strong>Watergate to Trump: Amol Rajan Interviews</strong><br/><em>BBC Two, 7pm</em><br/>This week, Amol Rajan meets two of the most celebrated names in investigative journalism. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein were the Washington Post reporters who broke the Watergate scandal and brought about the downfall of US president Richard Nixon. Fifty years on, Rajan asks, what do they make of Trump, Biden and politics in America today?</p><p><strong>Alexander Armstrong in Sri Lanka</strong><br/><em>Channel 5, 9pm</em><br/>“This is about the most beautiful and inspiring island you could imagine. Shall we go and explore it?” Armstrong invites viewers to join him on a three-part tour of the Indian Ocean isle, taking in lush landscapes, ancient cultures, health treatments, food and an elephant sanctuary.</p><p><strong>Inside No 9</strong><br/><em>BBC Two, 10pm</em><br/>A decidedly retrospective episode of the scintillating comedy-horror anthology, with Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith taking inspiration from the vintage ITV sitcom On the Buses. Wolfie and Clarke love the No 9 bus they work on. But perhaps not as much as mysterious passenger Mr Cole and his “dollybird nieces”. Aptly, Robin Askwith guest stars. </p><p><strong>Open House: The Great Sex Experiment</strong><br/><em>Channel 4, 10pm</em><br/>Another run of Channel 4’s series in which couples explore the benefits – and pitfalls – of non-monogamy by opening up their relationship to having sex with other people. Tonight, Connor and Kirstie are interested in connecting with another man… but things soon go off the rails when they actually get to the bedroom. </p><p><strong>Air (2023) ★★★</strong><br/><em>Amazon Prime Video  </em><br/>Don’t let the premise (multi-million dollar company signs big name celebrity, makes shoes, then more cash) put you off. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/air-review-ben-affleck-matt-damon-almost-make-care-shoe/\">Ben Affleck’s absorbing story</a> behind the creation of Nike’s bestselling Air Jordan trainer (named after Chicago Bulls player Michael Jordan) features a raft of impressive co-stars, including Matt Damon and Viola Davis. It’s got tension and drama to boot. Air is available to watch on Prime Video from May 12.</p><p><strong>Bridge of Spies (2015) ★★★★★</strong><br/><em>Film4, 6.15pm  </em><br/>Steven Spielberg’s rewarding Cold War thriller swirls with intrigue; its tension is worthy of the best of Alfred Hitchcock’s classic noir films. Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, a US lawyer recruited by the CIA to defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, in a role that won him a Bafta and an Oscar) and arranges to trade him for a captured US pilot in East Berlin. Amy Ryan and Alan Alda also stalk through the fog. You’ll be gripped from the outset.</p><p><strong>Summer Holiday (1963) ★★★</strong><br/><em>BBC Four, 10.50pm  </em><br/>In this feel-good musical, a group of London bus mechanics decide during one miserable, wet British summer lunch break to “borrow” a double-decker bus from their employer, convert it into a holiday caravan and drive across Europe to Athens, picking up a group of female companions on the way. It was Peter Yates’s directorial debut and stars some young crooner named Cliff Richard. Also on Saturday on BBC One at 1pm.</p>\n",

      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">Friday 19 May</h2><p><strong>Unreported World </strong><br/><em>Channel 4, 7.30pm</em><br/>In Tennessee, drag queens find themselves on the frontline of America’s culture war. The Republican state has recently introduced a de-facto “drag ban” law, which will prohibit drag shows in any public space where a child might see them. In tonight’s chewy Unreported World, the last in this series, reporter Minnie Stephenson travels to the Deep South to explore the deep divisions between conservative Christians and the wider LGBTQ+ community. </p><p>The main trigger for Republicans are Drag Queen Story Hours, where drag performers read stories to children in libraries and coffee shops. According to Republican Congressman Tim Burchett, the shows involve “a grown man dressed up as a lady, rubbing his crotch in front of a prepubescent child”. Although that doesn’t quite match the reality that Stephenson finds: a children’s entertainer in costume, reading a story about broccoli and ice cream. Still, it is not uncommon for these events to be protested against, sometimes by militia with guns. The wider fear is that the drag ban is a gateway to a larger crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights. The drag queens she meets fear for their livelihoods, and their lives.<em><strong> SK</strong></em></p><p><strong>Primo</strong><br/><em>Amazon Freevee</em><br/>Set in San Antonio, Texas, this sparky eight-part comedy follows 16-year-old Rafa (Ignacio Diaz-Silverio) as he navigates his chaotic Mexican family. It is based on the upbringing of creator Shea Serrano, who writes the family’s never-ending array of colourful uncles with pathos and wit.</p><p><strong>Gardeners’ World</strong><br/><em>BBC Two, 8pm</em><br/>Now that the risk of frost has passed, it is a good time to put tender plants in the ground. Hence why Monty Don is busy planting tropical gingers and sowing beans, and Rekha Mistry shares her secrets for growing aubergines. Journalist Rosie Kinchen also explains how horticulture helped her deal with postnatal depression.</p><p><strong>Susan Calman’s Grand Day Out</strong><br/><em>Channel 5, 8pm</em><br/>Comedian Susan Calman takes her campervan to the south coast this week. There are the usual travelogue shenanigans. She digs for fossils on the Jurassic Coast, drives a vintage tram and visits a chilli farm. But there is also the sweet moment when Calman, an Agatha Christie super-fan, is charmingly overwhelmed when she gets the chance to visit the author’s house in Dittisham. </p><p><strong>Hidden Treasures of the National Trust</strong><br/><em>BBC Two, 9pm</em><br/>The second week takes us behind the scenes of Bateman’s in East Sussex, a beautiful 17th century house that once belonged to Rudyard Kipling. Elsewhere, another writers’ retreat: the Elizabethan Sissinghurst Castle in Kent, whose majestic gardens played host to Vita Sackville-West.</p><p><strong>Black Ops</strong><br/><em>BBC One, 9.30pm</em><br/>The third episode of the daft undercover cop comedy is its funniest yet. The incompetent duo, heavily in debt to a terrifying gang, need money. To cynical Dom (Gbemisola Ikumelo), the solution is obvious: siphon off the funds that naive Kay (Hammed Animashaun) has been raising for his church leader Pastor Tomi (Lucian Msamati), who’s “the first man to put the Gospel to Drill”. </p><p><strong>Bump</strong><br/><em>BBC One, from 11.25pm; NI, from 11.30pm</em><br/>This tender Australian comedy-drama began as the story of an unplanned teenage pregnancy. The third series, however, jumps ahead a few years, with tonight’s brilliant double-bill following the tenacious Oly (Nathalie Morris) as she adapts to life as the youngest mother at her daughter’s school. It is as charming as it is raw. </p><p><strong>Maybe I Do (2023)</strong><br/><em>Amazon Prime Video  </em><br/>Imagine nervously plucking up the courage to take your new love interest home to your respective parents, only to discover they already know each other... well. That’s the gist of this genial romcom, which stars Diane Keaton and Richard Gere, and William H Macy and Susan Sarandon as two respective long-term couples battling their own woes; their children (played by Emma Roberts and Luke Bracey), meanwhile, are off falling in love. Obviously, it doesn’t all go to plan.</p><p><strong>Hereditary (2018) ★★★★</strong><br/><em>Film4, 9pm  </em><br/>You’ll need nerves of steel for Ari Aster’s debut, one of the most harrowing occult thrillers in recent years. It’s not that gory, but it’s riddled with all of David Lynch’s icky bits. Toni Collette heads up a family who become haunted by a mysterious presence after the death of their matriarch, with whom daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro) shared a special bond. Aster’s latest film Beau is Afraid, starring Joaquin Phoenix, is in cinemas now.</p><p><strong>Halloween Ends (2022) ★★★</strong><br/><em>Sky Cinema Premiere, 10pm </em> <br/>John Carpenter’s Halloween (1978) is generally fêted as ground zero for the “slasher” genre; this supposedly final instalment reunites Jamie Lee Curtis’s Laurie Strode with crazed killer Michael Myers (James Jude Courtney). His entry is belated and a bit contrived, but there is no denying that the film clicks up a gear when he’s on screen – he is one of horror’s true stars and powers through the mediocrity one brutal swipe at a time.</p><p><strong>The Proposal (2009) ★★★</strong><br/><em>ITV1, 10.45pm  </em><br/>When high-flying book editor Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) finds out that she faces being deported to her native Canada, she pretends to be engaged to her useless assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds). But with his side of the bargain – she must fly to Alaska to meet his eccentric family – and a suspicious official knocking around, it soon becomes more difficult than imagined. And of course, the sparks begin to fly.</p><h5><em>Television previewers</em></h5><p><em>Chris Bennion (<strong>CB</strong>), Jack Taylor (<strong>JT)</strong>, Veronica Lee (<strong>VL</strong>), Stephen Kelly (<strong>SK</strong>), Gerard O’Donovan (<strong>GO</strong>), Poppie Platt (<strong>PP</strong>) and Gabriel Tate (<strong>GT</strong>)</em></p>\n",

      "<p>Bismarck’s War calls on many witnesses to tell this story, from famous names to ordinary civilians and soldiers; it quotes extensively from correspondence and diaries. Dietrich von Lassberg, a soldier from Bavaria and diligent journal-keeper, is returned to throughout. Such frequent glimpses of his life – he says goodbye to his family, his boots rub, he wonders what the French think of his presence beside a statue of Joan of Arc – make it easy to be invested in his story. His first entry is excited: “War! War with France!” Later, upon receiving his first letters from home after his brother’s death, he records only “          ”. The idea that some things are unspeakable or unrelatable comes through repeatedly in these testimonies. “I have neither the power nor heart to describe what we saw there,” a British observer reported. “You must see it yourselves to realise it in all its horrid truth.”</p><p>Bismarck himself, however, often feels curiously vague. His role is shown to be pivotal, but he still doesn’t seem a “main character”. Perhaps this is partly because he often seems to pull strings behind the scenes. His role in the “Ems Telegram” that provoked France into declaring war, or in the “Kaiser Letter” in which Wilhelm, King of Prussia, was asked to become German Emperor, both see him subtly shaping events from the shadows. When Napoleon III surrenders, Wilhelm consults with Bismarck, Moltke and Friedrich Wilhelm – but “Bismarck dictates the reply”.</p><p>This handling also brings to mind recent controversy around the restoration of Bismarck’s imposing monument in Hamburg. In 2021, protests erupted against memorialising a figure linked to nationalism and colonialism; the Hamburg Ministry of Culture and Media held a series of public seminars in response, posing the question: “Bismarck. Bismarck? Wer wird hier eigentlich geehrt?” (“Bismarck. Bismarck? Who is actually being honoured here?”) The Bismarck who brought Germany together, or the Bismarck who waged wars and expanded an empire? Chrastil’s compassionate and thought-provoking history does justice to both sides of this legacy, the great statesman’s achievements tempered with their human cost.</p><hr/><p><em>Bismarck’s War is published by Penguin at £30.

What he has is wildcard youngsters with the potential to turn matches against Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United. </p><p>Leeds have quietly acquired one of the best groups of young players in the Premier League, with some saying they are only behind Manchester City’s factory of talent in terms of quality. </p><p>The mastermind behind the likes of Greenwood arriving from other academies is Craig Dean, Leeds’ head of emerging talent. A former scout for the Football Association, he then held roles at Newcastle and Oxford before arriving at Elland Road five years ago. </p><p>In the short term, Dean has provided Allardyce with gamechangers for the next fortnight in Crysencio Summerville and Greenwood. Moving forwards, Leeds have a stable of young players who can get them back into the Premier League should they go down.</p><p>Dean targeted Darko Gyabi from Manchester City last summer. Mateo Joseph also came from Espanyol during that window and is heading to the Under-20 World Cup with England, having chosen them over Spain. Joe Gelhardt and Cody Drameh are on loan to EFL clubs and would be valuable in a Championship promotion campaign.  </p><p>It was Dean who scouted the players and held the initial recruitment meetings, putting together structured deals with low payments up front and add-ons. Victor Orta would put the finishing touches to the deals but it was Dean’s eye for talent. </p><p>Orta and his scouts have departed Elland Road in their last-ditch bid for Premier League survival but Dean has stayed. Leeds’ Under-21 side will face Nottingham Forest on Monday evening in the Premier League 2 play-off final as they look for promotion to Division 1, with a crowd of several thousand expected to attend. </p><p>It will be respite from the relegation battle, where they picked up a point against Newcastle at the weekend, with goalkeeper Joel Robles saying there is belief within Allardyce’s squad. </p><p>“Obviously we played against a top,top team, playing for the Champions League,” he said. “At the moment we need three points but I'm happy because we believed until the end. </p><p>“For me, the most important thing is the mentality in that situation. At 2-1 down, at that moment we destroyed our job, in that moment it was important to keep our belief. They put everything in, in the dressing room they were really tired and I love to see that. We have to enjoy the moment and be composed. It is a difficult moment for everyone but we believe.”</p><hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Sam Allardyce ‘needed two Valium to calm down’ after chaotic Leeds draw</h2>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p><strong>By Mike McGrath at Elland Road</strong></p><p>Sam Allardyce’s reaction to getting his Leeds United reign up and running in such a thrilling game was that he needed to take Valium after the final whistle. He headed straight down the tunnel after a first point as manager and players embarked on a lap of honour, yet there was the feeling it was a chance missed on an afternoon when emotions swung wildly.</p><p>It was all too much for one fan, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/13/leeds-united-fan-pushes-newcastle-united-manager-eddie-howe/\">who confronted Newcastle manager Eddie Howe</a> in the dugout in a stoppage-time incident which the Football Association will look into. The disturbing flashpoint came at the end of a match that had everything: goals, penalties, missed penalties, red cards and dramatic fightbacks.</p><p>“I needed two Valium when I came off to calm me down,” the Leeds manager joked. “I enjoyed it actually. I was nervous as we were at home and wanted to give the fans something but it gave me hope going forward because they gave everything.”</p><p>In another world, it could have been champagne for Allardyce. His team were one goal ahead through Luke Ayling’s early tap-in and when Junior Firpo won a penalty, Patrick Bamford picked up the ball. Leeds also had Rodrigo Moreno on the pitch, who had scored a penalty earlier in the campaign, but Bamford was the taker, Nick Pope saved and momentum shifted. How relegation battles can hinge on such moments.</p><p>“With the spirit and commitment, if we went 2-0 up we would have won the game,” Allardyce added. “I left it how it used to be with the penalty taker. I haven’t seen them take too many penalties. I would have thought if Rodrigo really wanted it he would have tried to snatch it, we see that quite a bit. It can happen to anybody. It happened to us today at the worst possible time which was very unfortunate for us.”  </p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Leeds were prone to collapsing under Javi Gracia before Allardyce’s arrival and there was a sense of inevitability over what would come next. It only took three minutes and 23 seconds for Newcastle to level through a penalty of their own, after Max Wober had chopped down Alexander Isak. Callum Wilson scored his spot-kick and added another after Firpo’s handball.</p><p>“All week it’s ‘stay on your feet’ in the final third, especially in the box, and I don’t like it when they ignore me,” said Allardyce. “It happened last week to Pascal (Struijk) and he got a b------ing. We are giving goals away by doing that and we can’t afford it because we are not prolific goalscorers. Of course, under pressure players lose it for that particular moment. He thought he could win the ball and he couldn't.”</p><p>Leeds folded in their last games under Gracia, conceding heavily against Crystal Palace (5), Liverpool (6) and Bournemouth (4) but at least Allardyce was encouraged by how his team stayed in the match, helped by their goalkeeper Joel Robles and eventually levelled through Rasmus Kristensen when his volley flew in off Kieran Trippier’s head.</p>\n",

      "<p>“A point is massive for us, especially with how we did it. We had a chance to go 2-0 up and then that happened. In weeks before we'd probably lose that four or 5-1,” said Ayling. \"The fans have been with us all season. It's been hard for them sometimes. They stuck with us in this match.”</p><p>There was still time for Firpo to be dismissed for hauling down Anthony Gordon through on goal. It was no wonder that fans and players celebrated the point, their first under Allardyce. But victory would have sent them out of the relegation zone and there will need to be improvement against West Ham and Tottenham in their remaining games,</p><p>“Allowing ourselves to get knocked back a couple of times, the way we stayed in the game was very good,” said Allardyce. “We have shot ourselves in the foot quite often but we have shown enough to say if we cut out those mistakes we can get three points perhaps. We should have won it but that was down to our fault. Even with 10 men we had to defend well as we could have lost the game.</p><p>“I hope it goes to the wire. All I’ve said is that when we go to Tottenham on the final day, I hope there is something in it for us. We have to keep our fingers crossed that others don’t win. All we can do is what we did today but do it better.”</p>\n",

We were okay in the game without being at our best but we know in this league you have to be at your best.</p><p>\"You cannot underestimate how difficult this was for us.

The three men who have run the club since 2018 – Andrea Radrizzani, the majority shareholder, Victor Orta, the director of football, and Angus Kinnear, the CEO – have liked to portray themselves as progressive in their appointments but it has paid off only once, when they seduced the golden goose himself, Marcelo Bielsa, who made them look like visionaries. Before him and after him, their appointments have failed and such was the crisis facing them, when Javi Gracia's team took four points from a possible 21 in April, shipping 23 goals, that Radrizzani finally turned to Allardyce, a choice so alien to Orta's philosophy, that the director of football left.</p><p>\"With three games left, Leeds have a very narrow path to staying up. Allardyce has been focusing on their defensive frailties and in the 2-1 defeat by Manchester City there were signs of improvement in the back four and from the reserve goalkeeper, Joel Robles, brought in for Ilan Meslier who had understandably had an attack of the jitters after two seasons of bombardment. But the midfield remains the biggest problem in the absence of Tyler Adams, lacking pace, bite and obduracy. If he can sort that, Allardyce has a chance. </p><p>\"To stay up, Leeds need to hold their nerve. It is to Allardyce's credit that when everyone else had lost theirs, he has been able to hold his and make his players believe they can pull this off. None but the hardest-headed of pragmatists wanted him here, but few doubt that if they had brought him in when they far too belatedly sacked Jesse Marsch in February that they would be in a better predicament now.\"</p>\n",

      "<p>Sam Allardyce may be one of the Premier League's most famed escape artists, but when he took on his latest survival mission with Leeds United having just four matches of the season remaining – becoming the club's fourth head coach of the season, aged 68 and having been out of work for two years – plenty of eyebrows were raised.</p><p>Could 'Big Sam' work his magic again, and keep the famous Yorkshire club in the top flight – as he has done previously with Sunderland, Blackburn and Crystal Palace – or is there simply not enough time left for the former England manager to do his Houdini act?</p><p>After what many would call a free hit in his first game – a seemingly unwinnable fixture against Manchester City, from which they emerged with a creditable 2-1 defeat – the real job arguably starts today with the lunchtime visit of <em>nouveau riche</em> Newcastle.</p><p>Allardyce, who said his 2008 sacking by Newcastle after just eight months in charge was a “massive knockback”, claimed it will be a “cauldron” inside Elland Road today because of the “pressure we have put on ourselves by the position we are in” and his players will need to ride that wave of emotion – not be crushed by it.</p><p>That defeat by City dropped Leeds into the relegation zone, but matches against West Ham and Spurs after today look like they could yield points. Allardyce is big on old-fashioned man management and Leeds fans will hope he has lifted his players spirits sufficiently for them to lift the club out of the drop zone this lunchtime, and pile pressure on their rivals Nottingham Forest, Everton and Leicester.</p><p>“I know Leeds are in a lot of trouble,” Allardyce said upon taking the job. “But I have seen a lot of trouble before.”</p><p>For Newcastle, today is about getting their thrilling ambush of the 'big six' back on track. A run of emphatic wins over Spurs (6-1), Everton (4-1) and Southampton (3-1) was brought to a juddering halt last weekend by a sobering 2-0 home defeat by Arsenal, but Eddie Howe's side are still third, three points clear of fifth-placed Liverpool with a game in hand.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>By Sam Dean at Emirates Stadium</strong></p><p>Arsenal’s race is run, and the hope has gone. It is not officially over but even the most optimistic of supporters must now accept the reality of the situation. A title charge against Manchester City demands perfection and here, at home to a Brighton side of remarkable bravery and skill, Mikel Arteta’s side fell disastrously short of the standards that were required of them.</p><p>In truth, Arsenal also fell some way short of their own usual standards as a club. Worn down by a long season, drained by the emotions of it all and stripped bare by the brilliant tactical mind of Roberto De Zerbi, they looked like ghosts in red and white. The legs appeared to have run out of energy, and the pool of ideas seemed to have run dry.</p><p>By the time Brighton scored their third, through full-back Pervis Estupinan, there were empty seats all over the Emirates Stadium. This has been a campaign of late drama in north London but there was no expectation or belief, as the match approached its conclusion, of another Arsenal comeback. Not this time, and not against this Brighton team.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Few opponents have done to Arsenal what Brighton did to them there. This was a match that was played almost entirely on the visiting side’s terms, with De Zerbi’s team building from the back with courage, and then attacking with menace. It was Brighton, rather than Arsenal, who played the more adventurous football. It was Brighton, rather than Arsenal, who took the risks.</p><p>To watch and listen to Arteta afterwards was to see a man who knew his dream had died. He did not quite say that, as the title remains a mathematical possibility, but his body language said more than his words. Rarely has the Spaniard sounded so defeated.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>In time, perhaps even in the space of a few days, the perspective will return and Arteta will remember that his team has produced a campaign that was beyond all expectations. To even be here, challenging City in the final weeks of the season, will come to be seen as an achievement. But in the moment, the rawness of the emotions clouded that judgement. “It is difficult to see that picture today,” Arteta admitted.</p><p>Arsenal have won only two of their last seven league games, which is the primary reason why this title race has swung out of their control. This was not the day that cost them, really, although it was clearly the most gruelling afternoon of football that they have experienced at their own stadium in the past year.</p><p>Some of the home supporters might grumble about certain refereeing decisions but, overall, there can be no excuses for what took place. The team that played the better football on the day was the team that left with three points. De Zerbi knew it, and he revelled in it: The Italian blew kisses to the Arsenal fans in the second half, and then slid to his knees in celebration of Brighton’s third.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>“I can decide how I can lose, not how I can win,” De Zerbi said. “I want to lose playing with this style, with this courage, to try to command the play and to command the ball. Today we showed our values, our passion. We showed we are serious people.”</p><p>Arsenal, by contrast, offered some markedly unserious defending in the second half. Brighton’s first goal was allowed to happen because Jakub Kiwior, the Arsenal centre-back, stopped playing after his heel had been stepped on. As Julio Enciso headed in, Kiwior was staring at the turf and praying the game would be stopped. A penny for the thoughts of Tony Adams, or any of the more rugged centre-backs in Arsenal’s long history.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>The second also stemmed from an error, with Leandro Trossard surrendering the ball in midfield against his former club. Brighton were still pushing high — how many other teams would press the Arsenal defence in the 86th minute, when leading 1-0? — and Deniz Undav calmly lobbed Aaron Ramsdale.</p><p>All across the pitch, Arsenal’s players lost their individual battles. Moises Caicedo, who was wanted by Arsenal in January and still wanted by them now, produced a monstrous defensive performance at right-back. Kaoru Mitoma dazzled Ben White. And Levi Colwill, the young centre-back on loan from Chelsea, gave a sensational display on and off the ball.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>“The best example of courage was Colwill in this game,” said De Zerbi, whose players remain on track to qualify for Europe. “We defended man to man, and Colwill’s man was [Martin] Odegaard. Colwill went 80 or 90 metres [up the pitch] to defend Odegaard. This is courage.”</p><p>For Arsenal, it is time now to think of why they have stumbled in the past few weeks. Defensive injuries are the most obvious reason, but has something else been missing? In some matches it has been physical power, in others it has been a more ruthless mentality. Here it was simply technical quality, which is unusual indeed for a team containing the likes of Odegaard, Gabriel Jesus, Jorginho and Bukayo Saka.</p><p>Arsenal might argue that the game plan would have worked if Gabriel Martinelli had not limped off, after a strong challenge by Caicedo, but that would be to hide from the reality of the match. When Estupinan converted the third in stoppage time, and De Zerbi fell to the turf in delight, it did not flatter the visitors.</p>\n",

      "<p>No Ivan Toney, no problem. So it was for Brentford against West Ham as they breezed to a 2-0 victory in the sunshine at Gtech Community Stadium; in lieu of Toney, absent with a minor hamstring injury, two of the hosts’ front three scored.</p><p>In a curious way, this was a game defined by its absences. Nine West Ham changes from Thursday’s Europa Conference League semi-final betrayed this match’s status. It was not only players who had minds elsewhere; it took barely 60 seconds for West Ham fans to belt out “We’re all going on a European tour”. The words were heard again when Danny Ings contentiously had a second-half goal disallowed for handball, after the ball deflected off Divin Mubama’s hand, during West Ham’s lone threatening spell of the match.</p><p>If West Ham’s travails were unsurprising, the more interesting question was how Brentford would cope with their own absentee: Toney. To those who have seen Toney’s 66 goals over three seasons for the club, it is an unpalatable prospect. And yet it is one that Brentford could soon have to confront. There are twin threats to Toney’s future here: The possibility of a ban for <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2022/11/16/ivan-toney-charged-fa-232-betting-breaches/\">breaching the Football Association’s betting rules</a>; and the risk that Toney leaves the club altogether.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Toney’s improvement this year – he has gone from 12 goals to 20, while his broader impact on matches has grown commensurately – is such that Brentford are braced for serious interest from more affluent rivals. Were Harry Kane to leave Tottenham Hotspur, it is easy to envisage them identifying Toney as the nearest there is to a like-for-like replacement, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/03/16/england-squad-announcement-euro-qualifiers-live-italy-ukraine/\">the same view that Gareth Southgate has now taken for England</a>.</p><p>Both Brentford and Toney will also be aware that, at 27 – notwithstanding that he has been a late developer – clubs might not be minded to spend quite as much to sign him in years to come. For while Brentford’s rise has been underpinned by astute recruitment, the cousin of this has been unsentimentally letting fine players go when the price makes it good business.</p><p>Consider the man who arrived on the pitch in the 59th minute, but for West Ham: Said Benrahma. From 2018-20, Benrahma enjoyed two productive years at Brentford – the first member of the original ‘BMW’ strikeforce, alongside Neal Maupay, who left in 2019, and Ollie Watkins. All three were sold before Brentford reached the Premier League. And yet the money received for the trio – a combined £64 million – helped Brentford rise to ninth in the top flight and become part of the Premier League middle-class.</p><p>The BMW replacements – Toney, Bryan Mbeumo (bought in 2019, he became the middle 'M' for a year) and Yoane Wissa – cost £19 million. While making a £45 million profit, then, Brentford continued their upward ascent.</p><p>Against West Ham, Mbeumo showcased his own improved Premier League campaign by defeating Lukasz Fabianski for the opening goal – though Fabianski will wince looking back at his attempted save – and providing persistent menace. Emerson Palmieri endured a torrid afternoon at left-back; Mbeumo also harassed his team-mates when drifting to other positions. Aged 23, Mbeumo is gaining acuity to go with his pace – this Premier League season he has had twice as many successful crosses as last year, completed more dribbles and scored seven goals compared to four.</p><p>“Bryan is sometimes going a little bit under the radar – I think he's a fantastic player,” said Brentford manager Thomas Frank. “He could, should have scored more – in terms of probably being a little bit unlucky in some situations. Plus the importance for us in pressing and defensive work, he works so hard for the team.”</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Wissa secured the game-clinching second goal in the 43rd minute, tucking the ball away after Ben Mee flicked on Mathias Jensen’s long throw; he could have added to this on several occasions, most notably after a one-two with Mbeumo when Tomas Soucek had carelessly given the ball away.</p><p>Kevin Schade, the 21-year-old German international signed in January in the expectation of his impact in the years to come, did not match the presence of Toney – who could be available for the last throes of the season – in front of goal. But Schade provided a subtly different threat – \"it was a very dynamic front three,\" Frank purred. A pinpoint cross from the left-hand side should have provided Mikkel Damsgaard with the opener in the seventh minute.</p><p>For Brentford, no matter; for West Ham, it scarcely seemed to matter. Indeed, perhaps the most concerning aspect of West Ham’s afternoon came with news that Michail Antonio has a calf injury, seemingly making him a major doubt for next Thursday’s clash with AZ Alkmaar. Maintain their upward trajectory, and Brentford will soon be planning a European tour of their own.</p>\n",

      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Chelsea 1 Manchester United 0</h2><p><strong>By Tom Garry, women’s football reporter at Wembley</strong></p><p>Chelsea's match-winner at Wembley yet again, Sam Kerr is a star with the world at her feet and, just two months out from a World Cup in her home country, she reminded everybody of her ability to thrive on the big stage as she won Emma Hayes' team a third consecutive Women's FA Cup.</p><p>Kerr's fifth goal in her past three Wembley appearances was enough to see her grab the headlines for a third third FA Cup final in succession, while extending Manchester United’s wait for their first major women’s trophy, as Chelsea continued their domination of this cup in the modern era with a fifth success since 2015.</p><p>The FWA Player of the Year and Matildas captain Kerr celebrated with one of her trademark acrobatic flips after slotting in from Pernille Harder’s exquisite low pass to keep Chelsea on course for a domestic double, with the Women’s Super League title race in their hands, and that could be just the start of an unforgettable summer for the 29-year-old, as she is set to be Australia's poster star and talismanic leader on the pitch when the co-host the much-anticipated World Cup from 20 July to 20 August.</p><p>“I’ve never coached a player like her,\" Hayes said of Kerr. \"A player that has such conviction, confidence and courage with the way she attacks everything. But what I love about Sam is that she’s willing to take responsibility at the top of the pitch. It’s important to mention Pernille Harder because without her, she wouldn’t have got that goal.</p><p>\"She’s just so alive to situations and can cope with the pressure and expectations and everything that comes with being a top-level footballer. She’s the sweetest human being and she’s such a lovely person.\"</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Wales' Sophie Ingle said Kerr simply \"thrives on the big games\", while England defender Jess Carter added of Kerr: “She’s made for the big stage, isn’t she? We all know as a team that if we can stay in the game and keep a clean sheet, we’ll create chances and we've got players who will score goals for us.\"</p><p>With Wembley officially sold-out for the club-level women’s game’s showpiece event for the first time in the history of the Women’s FA Cup, a new competition-record of 77,390 were in attendance, greatly surpassing the previous best that this fixture had seen, which was last season’s 49,094. Despite that pressure, Kerr, confident as ever, seemed to know she would score. \"A lot of people have been asking for it [the back flip celebration]. I text my friend and said back flip incoming today.\"</p><p>She also played down her contribution, adding: \"I'd be wrong to say it was all me. I'm just lucky to be the number nine in this great team. I don't deserve this [Player of the Match award]. People are way more deserving than me.\"</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>For the first hour, it looked like that prize would go to a Manchester United player as they were the stronger team initially, but were left to rue not making the most of their chances, as clinical Chelsea continued their record of having never lost to Manchester United. Kerr, United's nemesis, has now scored eight times in eight appearances against them.</p><p>Just five years after belatedly re-forming a senior women’s team following a controversial 13-year hiatus from the women’s game, Manchester United were contesting their first major final, and making their debut appearance at Wembley. They showed no first-time cup-finalists nerves, though, bolting straight out of the blocks from kick-off.</p><p>They thought they had opened the scoring inside 30 seconds amidst a wave of noise and adrenaline, with winger Leah Galton slotting in to provide what appeared to be the dream start for Marc Skinner’s team, but the goal was ruled out because Ella Toone had been offside in the build-up.</p><p>Galton flicked narrowly over the bar at the near post from an Alessia Russo cross, and Russo also went close before Galton fired straight at Earps shortly after half-time, but Harder’s introduction from the bench seemed to swing the game into Chelsea’s favour.</p><p>The Denmark captain’s movement and pace caused problems for Manchester United’s defence - statistically the joint-strongest in the WSL this season - and he contribution played a major role in giving Chelsea manager Hayes and her team a 13th major trophy since 2015, with six league titles including 2017’s shorter Spring Series campaign, two League Cups and now a fifth FA Cup.</p><p>As for Manchester United, Skinner vowed that they will use the pain of this loss to drive them upwards, adding: \"This fuels us. To any Manchester United fan listening - we will continue to keep doing everything we can to get back into finals. Along the way we get a few bumps and today is one of them.</p><p>\"We’re on a growing phase. But I feel we’re bridging gaps. This is the club that you want to come to if you’re top talent, this is the club that’s going places. I’m not going to stop and this team is not going to stop. If anybody thinks that we’re going away, we’re not going away.These are just moments.

He feels, with the benefit of hindsight, his team back then had felt the weight of the occasion too much, by formalising lots of their cup-final matchday procedures so much and breaking from their usual routine. </p><p>He wanted to treat today more like a 'normal game', to relax his squad, so this time, he's opted for a black blazer, and smart black shoes. Emma Hayes, similarly, is in a smart black jacket, but has her usual white trainers on. Both managers are out in their technical areas issuing instructions.

      "<p><strong>By Daniel Schofield at the AJ Bell Stadium</strong></p><p>As the final whistle blew at an ecstatic AJ Bell Stadium, which hosted its largest crowd for this pulsating semi-final, those few Sale players who could still stand raised their arms aloft in celebration.</p><p>George Ford, described by Alex Sanderson as a “pocket of calm amid the chaos”, barely shrugged before seeking out Charlie Atkinson, the young Leicester replacement who had twice kicked penalties dead in the final 10 minutes, for a few words of consolation. Atkinson did not cost his team victory but Ford’s kicking from the tee and from hand most certainly secured Sale theirs, and with it a place in their first Premiership final since they were champions in 2006.</p><p>In a magnificent contest, probably the best advert for the Premiership all season, Ford’s composure and spiral bombs were the difference between two teams who left everything on the pitch. Sale finished with seven forwards on the grass after losing Ben Curry and Dan du Preez to potentially serious injuries. </p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>The outstanding Tom Curry also hobbled off while second row Jonny Hill was dry-retching with exhaustion. “These are British Lions players who ran their blood to water,” Sanderson said. “I couldn’t be prouder of them. It just showed how deep they drank from the well.”</p><p>Twelve months ago, Ford was guiding Leicester to victory in a semi-final only to depart early in the final with an Achilles injury that cost him seven months on the sidelines and allowed Freddie Burns to seize the glory. Yet again Leicester lost a fly-half to injury with Handre Pollard ruled out on the morning of the match with a sore calf, ensuring 39-year-old Jimmy Gopperth stepped into the fray.</p><p>His head-to-head with Ford was a fascinating contest and was fairly even in a shudderingly intense first half which finished 7-6 with Gopperth kicking two penalties to Tom Roebuck’s converted try. After half-time, Ford swung the momentum with three beautiful spiral kicks. The first was gathered by Guy Porter, only to be enveloped by Manu Tuilagi. The resulting penalty allowed Ford to put Sale 10-6 ahead.</p><p>The second came just before the hour mark and was dropped by Freddie Steward, although the ball went backwards. So discombobulated was the Leicester full-back by his failure to automatically claim a high ball that he shanked his kick out on the full. That gave Sale a platform from which they scored their second try with Ford’s pass bouncing into the path of Arron Reed, who finished superbly in the corner.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Then came the prettiest kick of the lot with just minutes remaining. With Sale’s forwards out on their feet, Ford gained 40 metres with a kick that shaved the touchline, gaining enough breathing space for Sale to see out their eight-point lead and start the type of party that Shaun Ryder used to enjoy at the Hacienda back in the day. The social, Sanderson said with no little understatement, would be “huge”.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest compliment to Ford’s performance was the manner in which Sale’s posse of young backs, the wings Roebuck and Reed, scrum-half Gus Warr and Joe Carpenter rose to the occasion in the biggest match of their careers. Full-back Carpenter, who more than matched Steward in the high ball stakes, put Roebuck over in the corner on 19 minutes after a fabulous mis-pass by Rob du Preez, who has been shunted out to outside centre since Ford’s return from injury. Tuilagi also had his best showing in many months, running on to Ford’s flat passing.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>“You need to be physically up to the task and you need the heart and then on the back of both those things you need someone to make those calm, considered decisions on the field and steer the ship,” Sanderson said. “That’s hard when you are looking to punch holes in what is a very good defence.”</p><p>Leicester should have no regrets from a season which was upended by the RFU’s wholesale poaching of their coaching staff. Tommy Reffell was a sensation at the breakdown, winning three jackal turnovers in the first half alone. Jasper Wiese carried himself into a standstill and Dan Kelly was excellent at inside centre, throwing a gorgeous mis-pass that cut out two Sale defenders for Harry Potter to score Leicester’s only try, which gave them a 13-10 lead in the second half. From there Ford took control.</p>\n",

      "<p>“It was tight, wasn’t it?” Richard Wigglesworth, Leicester’s head coach, said after taking charge of his final match before heading off to join Steve Borthwick's England unit. “We couldn’t quite get an advantage in the key areas. You are going to miss Handre Pollard in any team but it’s not an excuse. </p><p>“We made the call this morning. He hadn’t trained the last couple of days. Calf issue. The best team won. </p><p>“I’ve loved it and made friends for life. It’s been an absolute privilege to lead the club.”</p><p>Sale were worthy winners and the final against Saracens sets up several intriguing narratives with Sanderson coaching against his former mentor Mark McCall and Ford against his childhood friend Owen Farrell. All this will be considered after the hangovers subside. “We’ve got a big party after this,” Sanderson said. “We will have a good drink, responsibly of course.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Match details</h2><p><strong>Sale Sharks: </strong>J Carpenter; T Roebuck, R du Preez, M Tuilagi (S James, 56), A Reed; G Ford, G Warr (R Quirke 50); S McIntyre (B Rodd, 48), A van der Merwe (E Ashman, 56), N Schonert (C Oosthuizen, 48), J-L du Preez, J Hill, T Curry (J Beaumont, 72), B Curry (D du Preez, 28 (T O’Flaherty, 74)), J Ross.<br><strong>Leicester Tigers:</strong> F Steward; A Watson, M Scott (G Porter, 65), D Kelly, H Potter; J Gopperth (C Atkinson, 70), B Youngs (J van Poortvliet, 36); T West (J Cronin, 53), J Montoya, D Cole (J Heyes, 58), G Martin, C Henderson (H Wells, 70), H Liebenberg, T Reffell, J Wiese (O Cracknell, 73).</br></p>\n",

      "<p>Hello and welcome to Telegraph Sport's live coverage of today's second Premiership semi-final between Sale Sharks and Leicester Tigers at the AJ Bell Stadium.</p><p>No matter the result in Salford today, history of sorts will be made. A win for Sale would see the Sharks progress to their first final in 17 years, since their one and only Premiership triumph in 2006. Their opponents that day? Leicester Tigers of course.</p><p>At the heart of that Sale effort in 2006 was a fledgling scrum-half by the name of Richard Wigglesworth. Today, however, Wigglesworth finds himself as interim head coach of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2023/05/14/richard-wigglesworth-turned-it-around-leicester-tigers/\">the side trying to get one over his boyhood club</a>, with the Tigers hoping to reach consecutive Premiership finals for the first time in 10 years.</p><p>Form this season, notwithstanding the Tigers' remarkable last season charge where they won six of their final Premiership matches, dictates that Sale are favourites today. The Sharks did the double over Leicester – including a 40-5 hammering in Salford in December – en route to a fully deserved second-place finish in the table. Alex Sanderson has had quite the impact at Sale.</p><p>Sub-plots teem today but it is difficult to look beyond the man occupying the No 10 jersey for the hosts. George Ford was inspirational in the Tigers' Premiership title last season but today he is a Shark, hoping to appear at his second successive Premiership final – but with different clubs. There cannot be too many who have done that.</p><p>With two impressive, fairly well matched packs, the battle of the midfield – outside of Ford and opposite number, Handrè Pollard – could go a long way to deciding today's victor. Dan Kelly, Leicester's starlet who, were it not for a hamstring injury, might have played a much more prominent role in England's Six Nations campaign lines up against a former Leicester icon, Manu Tuilagi, in the Sale midfield. If Kelly can deny Sale forward momentum, then Leicester might have half a chance.</p><p>After <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2023/05/13/saracens-v-northampton-premiership-rugby-live-score-updates/\">their victory over Northampton yesterday</a>, Saracens await in the final at Twickenham in just under two weeks' time. No matter the result today, Mark McCall's side must surely be favourite's in English rugby's showpiece, but a statement result from one of these two could really put the cat among the pigeons.</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>By Chris Bascombe at Goodison Park</strong></p><p>Manchester City's modern greats sure know how to deliver the most unforgettable and welcome parting shots.</p><p>Ilkay Gundogan effectively wrapped the sky blue ribbons around the Premier League trophy after his two goals and assist turned a potentially complicated afternoon at Goodison Park into a stroll. Given his form, he may have been inclined to try to tie the bows with his wand of a right foot.</p><p>The expectation is that Gundogan's masterclass was part of the final act in his farewell tour as a City legend. If so, the guard of honour acclaiming his latest contribution ought to have extended from Merseyside to the Etihad.</p><p>These City skippers possess quite the habit for striding forward and leaving their mark when a slither of doubt arises during a title-race climax. See Vincent Kompany finding the top corner against Leicester City in 2019 for more details. Gundogan may never inspire calls for a statue like Kompany, Sergio Aguero or Kevin De Bruyne, but his propensity to bring order and class to jittery circumstances is a skill usually reserved for the footballing Gods.</p><p>The praise from Pep Guardiola for his current skipper was suitably effusive. \"A leader,\" he said. \"So clever, so intelligent. He is a guy who handles the pressure really well. I can show again and again his quality, importance and commitment to us and the club. It is not just scoring goals. He can do everything and everything well.\"</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>It begged the obvious follow-up question, why is he due to leave on a free transfer this summer, then? \"Nobody knows what will happen. We will see,\" Guardiola replied. Has he informed his hierarchy to convince Gundogan to stay? \"Yes.\"</p><p>In keeping with Gundogan's most memorable contributions, perhaps it is a question of timing as to when he will receive an offer he cannot refuse. As against Aston Villa on the final day last season, it was impeccable here.</p><p>The emphatic scoreline will blur memories that for 37 minutes into their latest footballing clinic, City were required to do something increasingly rare in their treble quest. Break sweat.</p><p>Everton were resisting, Erling Haaland was moaning about Yerry Mina's attentions – a gripe which Guardiola extended with confusing ambiguity post-match – and Mason Holgate was wondering why he lost his balance and poise when swinging his foot at a bouncing ball six yards from City's net.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>The champions' need for perspiration was brief. Cue the latest addition to Gundogan's bulging portfolio of momentum shifting goals. Receiving Riyad Mahrez's cross with his back to goal, Gundogan juggled the ball before executing the perfectly executed flick beyond a blindsided and bewildered Jordan Pickford.</p><p>Two minutes later Gundogan was dashing down City's left to cross for Haaland's 52nd of the season. With that, City's need to exert unwanted energy in between their double header with Real Madrid evaporated and Everton switched from playing the clock in pursuit of a point to trying to limit the damage to their goal difference. Even that was a forlorn hope.</p><p>Gundogan's 22 yard free-kick early in the second half reasserted the gulf in class, the only surprise being City failed to inflict further punishment. </p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Everton spent much of this week suggesting Dixie Dean's goal record for a single season is 92 and not 63. Whatever the official records show, at 3-0 down there was a brief fear in the home ranks Haaland might match the total there and then if City went for the kill. They were fortunate City eased off.</p><p>Sean Dyche had been buoyed by the performance at Brighton six days earlier, but City are playing a different sport to most others in the Premier League, let alone this Everton side. There were moments when their superiority bordered on the absurd as the hosts struggled to complete a meaningful passing sequence.</p><p>\"Sometimes you have to be realistic about the opposition,\" Dyche acknowledged. \"A lot of the performance was right, but if you make a mistake you get punished.\" The speed at which the champions retrieve possession is as intimidating as their excellence with the ball.</p><p>Until City dropped the tempo at three-up, Everton did not so much launch attacks as stampedes in an effort to make City's defence uncomfortable. This was a day when the home side winning a throw-in on the halfway line earned a standing ovation.</p><p>Now Everton must look to their away trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers and a nervy final day against Bournemouth to stay in the Premier League.

A point from the trip to the Etihad on New Year's Eve was the last Frank Lampard earned as Everton manager and the two weaknesses that bedevilled his managership of the club – inconsistency and toothlessness – were threatening to scupper Sean Dyche, too, until that well-organised, smash and grab raid on the Amex which showed their heart, nerve and a coolness that has been lacking for most of the past couple of years.</p><p>Back-to-back, high quality performances from bottom six clubs are rare and especially against a side so formidable as Manchester City who are going to have to keep their foot on the gas for the final six or seven games of the season if they are to bag their second Double or first Treble. With the home Champions League semi-final second leg tie against Real Madrid looming on Wednesday night, Guardiola may look to give Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden, Rico Lewis and Julian Alvarez run-outs, as he did against Leeds eight days ago. </p><p>As for Everton, who are one point and one place above Leeds, performance matters more than result with Wolves and Bournemouth to come. Something from this game, something like the storm that shocked Arsenal in February, would be magnificent and push them to the verge of safety. But the key will be to maintain their progress after Monday's great leap forward, to have them in perfect trim, even if they lose, to batter their last two opponents and banish the prospect of the drop – punishments for overspending apart. For City, it's all about the win. Points-wise they can afford to slip up. Psychologically it would be unwise to do so.</p><p>Seamus Coleman joins Ben Godfrey, Ruben Vinagre and Andros Townsend on the sidelines for the season. Pep Guardiola said on Friday morning that he hoped Nathan Ake would train later that day but even if he did it would be a risk to play him today.  Otherwise, City are picking from a full squad. </p><p> </p>\n",

Some productions might have material that is too mature for younger theatregoers. However, there are also fantastic family shows which are appropriate for all ages, or which are specifically aimed at kids – including shorter children’s shows with elements like puppetry and singalongs.</p><p>We have included the official production age recommendations with all of our London show picks on this page, but you can always consult the theatre in question for further information to ensure the show is suitable for your children. Find the best deals on London family shows at <a href=\"https://tickets.telegraph.co.uk/\">Telegraph Tickets</a>.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Can I take a 1 or 2 year old to the theatre?</h2><p>The majority of London theatre shows are aimed at kids from ages 3 upwards at least. The longer running times, and elements like busy lighting and sound design, plus more mature material, probably won’t suit 1 or 2 year olds. Most productions recommend that 3 year olds or older should attend.</p><p>However, there are some London plays and musicals for 1 or 2 year olds. For example, children’s theatres like the Polka Theatre, Half Moon Theatre, Unicorn Theatre and Little Angel Theatre host productions aimed at very young children, as well as fun interactive workshops.

Here’s a handy rewind of 10 lighter moments you might have missed:</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">1. Mel Giedroyc churning butter</h2><p>Graham Norton had a frantic night, dashing between his usual post in the BBC commentary booth and on-stage hosting duties. When he wasn’t behind the mic, Mel Giedroyc filled in with her gently sarcastic observations (“Wowsers McTrousers!” was one notable gem).</p><p>She <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbceurovision/status/1657485447281491971\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">caught viewers off-guard</a> by popping up in the background of one link, dressed as a Polish milkmaid (Giedroyc is of Polish descent) and suggestively churning butter - a nod to Poland’s 2014 entry Donatan &amp; Cleo. It reduced Norton to hysterics and recalled the halcyon days of her soggy-bottomed innuendos in the Bake Off tent. </p>\n",

      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">2. Croatia bait Putin in their underpants</h2><p>In their home country, Croatia’s Let 3 are a notorious anarcho-punk group who have poked fun at nationalism, supported LGBT Pride and were once arrested for performing naked - even though the band claimed they weren't entirely unclothed because they had “corks in their butts”. Don't try this at home.</p><p>Dressed in fake moustaches and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DublinClarke/status/1657494038478462976\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">militaristic fetish-wear</a> in front of two giant nuclear warheads, their anti-war song Mama ŠČ! was an audacious takedown of Vladimir Putin, calling the Russian leader an \"alligator psychopath” and mocking how he was gifted a tractor by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko for his 70th birthday. Naturally, they ended their eye-popping performance by stripping down to their Y-fronts. It sent Twitter into a tailspin.</p>\n",

      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">3. Austria photobombs the presenters</h2><p>Austrian duo Teya &amp; Salena kicked off proceedings with their high-concept stomper Who The Hell Is Edgar?. The lyrics saw them possessed by the ghost of goth poet Edgar Allen Poe, who compels them to write a song. As you do. The endearingly quirky pair had a ball after their performance, stealing the limelight by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ariadne_Reviews/status/1657502882332024832\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">goofing around in the background</a> and giving side-eye to the camera.

Waddingham laughed off their advances with ease. The German was the only one who got away with it, thanks to him sweetly offering Waddingham a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WeltonWears/status/1657515016549982209\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">biscuit in a box</a> – referencing a running gag in her hit comedy Ted Lasso.</p>\n",

Scouse popstrel Sonia even returned after 30 years to reprise Better The Devil You Know, which finished runner-up 30 years ago.</p><p>The most entertaining segment, however, was Icelandic fan favourite Daði Freyr performing local girl band Atomic Kitten’s Whole Again with deadpan faux-sincerity, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisgolds/status/1657503854273998848\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">accompanied by surreal projections</a> and a bottom-wiggling choir in matching jumpers.

Jan Leeming gives as good as she gets</h2><p>One of the night’s most endearing moments came when Graham Norton interviewed former newsreader Jan Leeming, who hosted the 1982 contest live from, ahem, Harrogate and still looked fabulous aged 81. What the global audience made of such a quintessentially British chat is anyone’s guess.</p><p>When Leeming marvelled at the scale of the event nowadays and modestly suggested that she couldn’t present it, Norton demurred: “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChristianCull/status/1657500103655956481\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Oh Jan, it’s like riding a bike!</a>” “I beg your pardon?” she shot back. \"How dare you!” Norton put his head in his hands and groaned: “Oh no, it’s all gone horribly wrong.”</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">8. France flip le bird</h2><p>Ooh la la. French-Canadian chanteuse La Zarra was hotly tipped for her song Évidemment. When the public votes were announced, some acts flew up the rankings by being awarded hundreds of points. When La Zarra received a modest boost of 50, leaving her a disappointing 16th out of 26, the crowd booed and cameras lingered on the 35-year-old.</p><p>She gave a Gallic shrug before spreading the fingers of her downwards right hand, then turning it over and insouciantly pointing her middle finger to the roof. She later claimed the gesture was “misinterpreted”. Oui, oui.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">9. Georgian juror spooks unsuspecting viewers</h2><p>Some of the international jury announcers play it straight. Others use their big moment as a bid to steal the limelight, cracking lame gags or sharing corny peace-and-love sentiments.</p><p>The hirsute presenter from Georgia did neither, instead gurning down the camera while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregjames/status/1657517768512532481\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wearing a bowler hat and goggles</a>, like a sort of steampunk village idiot. He turned out to be Iago Waitman, frontman of Georgian experimental prog-rock band Circus Mircus, who were flop semi-finalists last year. Distinctly disconcerting nonetheless.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">10. Dutch greeting gets mistranslated</h2><p>When Dutch TV presenter Stien den Hollander, also known as S10, announced the scores from the Netherlands jury, she went down a storm in the arena by saying hello to the \"girls and the gays”. Either coyly or clumsily, the BBC subtitles replaced it with \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottygb/status/1657509774315929600\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">girls and gaze</a>”.</p>\n",

There are over 1,000 individual items that the police are looking at as potential instances of fraud and go back a number of years.</p><p>\"Goods range from quite expensive items to relatively cheap everyday products, but the point is that all of these things together could add up to a very serious criminal allegation. Companies and political parties cannot just spend money any way they want - there are rules about how people are paid and there are obviously huge tax implications as well.</p><p>\"Everything needs to be properly accounted for, legally, and that is what the police are looking at here. It is an ongoing inquiry.

On Sunday opposition parties at Holyrood said the scale of the alleged fraud indicated a rotten culture within the SNP.</p><p>\"The plot thickens and thickens,\" Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour's deputy leader, said. \"This investigation goes to show how pervasive the culture of cover-up is at the heart of the SNP. Scotland deserves so much better than intrigue and sleaze from the SNP.\"</p><p>Craig Hoy, the Scottish Conservative Party chairman, compared the investigation to something targeting organised criminals.  \"The sheer number of alleged offences being investigated here is what you might expect from a probe into an organised crime syndicate, not a political party,\" he said.</p><p>\"Everyone who is questioned in relation to this has a duty to cooperate fully so the police can get to the bottom of this increasingly murky SNP scandal.\"<br/><br/>A spokesman for the SNP said: \"These issues are subject to a live police investigation.

      "<p>Brexit has helped to prevent Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine from succeeding, Jacob-Rees Mogg has claimed.</p><p>The former Brexit opportunities minister suggested there would have been a “mucky compromise” with the Russian leader, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/05/14/ukraine-russia-war-news-latest-zelensky-bakhmut-advance-put/\">whose war has been frustrated by the scale of Ukrainian resistance</a>, if British foreign policy were still aligned with Brussels.</p><p>Mr Rees-Mogg referred to the principle of “sincere cooperation”, which means the EU and its member states must “in full mutual respect assist each other” by performing tasks that stem from its range of treaties.</p><p>Asked by Sky’s Sophy Ridge what he would say the benefits of Brexit have been, Mr Rees-Mogg said: “We saved £191 billion by not being in the EU for <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/12/21/europes-pandemic-recovery-fund-unravels-billions-go-old-projects/\">its Covid recovery fund</a>. That would have been our share of the EU’s recovery fund. 191 billion, that’s one thing.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Johnson leadership helped stop Putin</h2><p>“What else – <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/exporting-from-uk/australia-trade-agreement/\">we’ve got a free trade deal with Australia</a> which will be much better than the forecasts predict. [And] we were able to show global leadership over Ukraine.</p><p>“Putin would probably have invaded Ukraine successfully if the UK had been bound in by the requirement of sincere cooperation and had had to follow a Franco-German line in dealing with Russia, which is what we did in 2014.</p><p>Pressed on whether he “genuinely” believed Putin would have launched a successful invasion without Brexit, Mr Rees-Mogg replied: “I think the leadership shown by Boris Johnson, which he could only do because he was not bound by sincere cooperation, ensured that a coalition was set up that made it impossible for Putin to succeed.</p><p>“And if I think that hadn’t been the case, we’d have been bound by this concept of sincere cooperation, we’d have had the mucky compromise that was delivered in 2014 when Russia invaded the Crimea. But I think it’s really important.”</p><p>Mr Johnson oversaw some £3.8 billion of military and economic support for Ukraine between the Russian invasion in February 2022 and his departure from Downing Street seven months later.</p><p>He enjoyed high levels of support among Ukrainians and paid a number of visits to the war-torn country, forming a close bond with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Support for Rishi</h2><p>Mr Zelensky has lauded the former prime minister for supporting his country “from the first day of the Russian terror” and championing Western military aid before many other European leaders.</p><p>Elsewhere in his interview on Sunday morning, Mr Rees-Mogg said it had “of course” been a mistake for Conservative MPs to oust Mr Johnson last summer after a series of scandals.</p><p>However, he added: “It would be an even bigger mistake now to get rid of Rishi Sunak. The Conservative Party cannot keep on changing leaders. We must back the leader we have got.</p><p>“I’m supporting Rishi Sunak, let me be clear about that. The Tory Party would be toast if we changed leader again, and we need to support the leader we’ve got. But that doesn’t mean we agree with him on every policy.”</p><p>Mr Rees-Mogg – who left Cabinet when Mr Sunak came to power in October – was among the speakers at a conference held by Conservative Democratic Organisation on Saturday.</p><p>The pressure group has been set up by disillusioned backers of Mr Johnson after he and then Liz Truss were forced out of No 10 despite being elected by party members. A number of its key figures have publicly urged the return of Mr Johnson.</p><p>“The people who have messed it up have been the MPs not the members of our party,” Mr Rees-Mogg told the conference.</p><p>He described Mr Johnson as the “most successful electoral asset” the Tories had, adding he was “removed without so much as a by-your-leave from the members”.</p>\n",

      "<p>Even during the pits of his recent woes, Matt Wallace knew he remained captivated by golf’s Sisyphean struggle. That is why not even <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2023/05/01/liv-golf-talor-gooch-tax-taking-almost-half-winners-cheque/\">the £7.5 million that his friend Talor Gooch</a> picked up on back-to-back Sundays inspired Wallace to understand what LIV Golf ultimately offers.</p><p>Gooch won in Adelaide and then in Singapore last month - picking up £3.25 million for each victory as well as approximately £1 million in petty cash for his Range Goats team - but actually saw his world ranking drop to 60th in this garlanded fortnight.</p><p>Unless the 29-year-old can finish in the top 15 <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2023/05/11/us-pga-championship-2023-start-time-how-to-watch-odds/\">at the USPGA Championship</a> - the major which starts in upstate New York on Thursday - he will fail to qualify for next month’s US Open. And that prospect dumbfounds Wallace.</p><p>“I saw my mate Talor Gooch has earned £19 million on LIV now or something,” Wallace says. “Great for him. But there was an article online saying that his decision must be justified and I look at it and go what’s justified about it? That he’s won £19 million? He got no world ranking points, no FedEx Cup points, nothing from it apart from a cheque and a trophy and he’s beaten a few players on there. Awesome. He’s probably playing the best golf in the world but that is kind of all he’s got from it.</p><p>“I know he likes his wine, so he’ll have bought a bunch, but for me the things that get me up in the morning are world ranking points, FedEx Cup points - and then the money. Because the first two take care of the third. That’s what gets me buzzed.”</p><p>Wallace was approached in the initial stages of LIV’s formation and named his price. “But I didn't even understand the concept and was told to pluck a number out of the air, so I did and it was genuinely obscene. But then, when it was happening, I was slowly declining in the rankings and I’ve just never been about it. It’s not been a thing for me. I love the highs and the lows of golf. Yeah, I won in Puntancana but I’ve now missed the last three cuts.</p><p>“On that Tour, you can’t miss a cut and experience those lows. You’re just taking the easy road, which I don’t have any qualms about with some of the players. If I was in their position at that stage of my career, maybe I’d have done the same . But some of the other players that have gone, well it feels like their careers have kind of ended a little short. They could’ve done a lot more things.”</p><p>This Zoom conversation began at 5am South Florida time and Wallace confesses that all the talk about the forthcoming major <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2023/05/04/ryder-cup-luke-donald-europe-usa-westwood-garcia/\">and September’s Ryder Cup</a> has caused his guard to slip. “Coming into this chat I was like, yeah, Ryder Cup just dumb it down, ‘we know what we need to do, take care of our business, blah, blah, blah’. But I have to be honest, it’s 5.30am and I’m f—--g fired up.”</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>It is heart-warming to see Wallace so upbeat. A chance meeting in a bar following his missed cut at The Players Championship in March revealed a contrasting figure. It was his fifth time in eight events that he had exited the gates prematurely, with his own ranking tumbling from the high of 23rd in July 2019, to outside the top 200.</p><p>“I have felt blank inside for the last two years,” Wallace muttered, gathering agreement that this was highly uncharacteristic for such a passionate soul. But there was gallows humour in his lament as he declared that the shots that were downed in the Jacksonville Beach establishment “were as ropey as the ones I hit out there on the course”.</p><p>The angst was obvious on his face, while the desperation was saved for posterity on his mobile phone. During this awful run, Wallace had recorded a video he would watch if and when he finally won again.</p><p>“I’ve had some down moments, that was one of the lowest, for sure. I needed to make that video for myself, to say like ‘this is s—’’. I might put on a front and say I’m fine and crack on but this game is tough, it’s so hard. I felt bad loads of times before, but it’s the how, the build-up of getting to that point. How I didn’t enjoy playing, the grind, the travel, being away, wanting to stop… but you can’t. You just can’t.”</p><p>The week after The Players, Wallace finished seventh in Tampa and the week after he broke his duck on the PGA Tour with a success in Dominica, a breakthrough triumph that guaranteed his card on the US circuit for two years and obtained entry to Oak Hill and a trip back to the major where he came third four years ago.</p><p>Yet as ever with the 33-year-old from Hillingdon, the glory was laced with controversy.  A clip went global of him telling his caddie, Sam Bernard, “to shut the f— up’, a flare up all too reminiscent of his on-course remonstrations to previous bagman Dave McNeilly.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>“Heat of the moment, Sam gives it as good as anyone I’ve ever met, and that’s exactly what I need. I don’t need someone to roll over and be a yes-man. The best thing about Sam and myself, because it is a relationship, literally after the round is finished, we look at each other and say ‘you good?’ ‘Yeah.’ ‘You good?’ ‘Yeah’.</p><p>“I enjoy the intensity of what sports brings, and I don’t think golf has that intensity. My level of intensity is probably more suited to football, but that’s who I am as a golfer. It’s not a caddie-player relationship problem. It’s an intensity problem of getting ourselves up there. This is why I feel like I play my best golf in the highest pressure moments because my focus is super narrow.”</p><p>Wallace is thus certain he would suit the Ryder Cup and with Ian Poulter now resigned from the DP World Tour and ineligible for the biennial dust-up which defines his professional life there is a gaping blue-and golf hole for a rouser-in-chief. Try as he may, Wallace cannot suppress the desire. Not internally. Not externally.</p><p>“One hundred per cent,” he replies when asked if he believes he would excel in that. “I know I could do well at the Ryder Cup. I love sport and this is the huge sporting event that I feel  this close to and can be a part of. It means so much to me, but I can’t let it be so much to me. This is my third campaign in trying to make it, and the last two haven’t worked out in my favour. So this one will be different.</p><p>“My coach Matt [Belsham] has been very straight with me, very blunt. ‘If you want to make that team, you need to play better’. Better even than I did when I won. That’s my goal. It’s what I’m going to do.”</p>\n",

      "<p>Yueh also presents something approaching a hierarchy of crises. Depending on the cause, a currency crisis can be shrugged off fairly easily. She points out that when the massive bets against the pound by the hedge-fund manager George Soros forced the UK to exit the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, the sharp depreciation in sterling helped boost the country’s competitiveness: “Some people refer to Black Wednesday as White Wednesday for this reason… there have been calls to put a statue of [Soros] in Trafalgar Square!” A stock-market crash tends to sting a little more. Investors lose their shirts, and this can depress consumer sentiment, with knock-on implications for the wider economy.</p><p>But a banking crisis is almost invariably a calamity. These lead to households and businesses paying back the debt they owe in order to deleverage at the same time as banks are unwilling to make fresh loans. The resulting “credit crunch” can cause a deep recession from which it is painfully hard to recover. Yueh, who served on the UK Treasury’s Independent Review Panel on Ring-Fencing and Proprietary Trading from 2021 and 2022, has had the chance to examine bank regulation up close. </p><p>What she can’t have known, however, is that her book would come out so soon after another banking scare. In recent months, the authorities have yet again had to step in when first Silicon Valley Bank, a midsized lender in the US, and then Credit Suisse, one of the world’s most venerable financial institutions, got into trouble. The worst appears to have been avoided this time, perhaps because regulators have learned some of the lessons of the past and now know the cost of bungling their response.</p><p>“In eighteen post-war banking crises, the aftermath was a slow economic recovery,” writes Yueh. “National output declined for roughly two years, falling by 9 per cent on average. Unemployment rose by seven percentage points over four years. Asset prices dropped steeply: house prices plunged, while equity prices declined by an average of 55 per cent over three and a half years.” Even for those instinctively opposed to regulation, seeing The Great Crashes spell out the numbers in black-and-white makes a powerfully persuasive case for why our banks must be kept on relatively short leashes. </p><hr/><p><em>The Great Crashes: Lessons from Global Meltdowns and How to Prevent Them is published by Penguin Business at £22.

      "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/concerts/why-eurovision-song-contest-2023-still-matters-european/\">Eurovision Song Contest 2023</a> is underway - and taking place in the UK for the first time since 1998. All eyes turn to Liverpool, as the nation pins its hopes on Mae Muller, whose I Wrote a Song has already broken into the pop charts (a promising sign). </p><p>A win may be unlikely, but she should at least escape the feared \"nul points\" given to our 2021 entry, James Newman. Or will she? To find out, tune in to BBC One for the Grand Final at 8pm on Saturday May 13.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/uk-eurovision-entries-winners-where-now-2021-bucks-fizz-blue/?onwardjourney=584162_c1\">UK's Eurovision</a> track record has always been contentious. Dodgy double-acts and spurious <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2022/05/13/eurovision-vote-voting-system-ukraine-kalush-orchestra-win-politics/\">voting tactics</a> have seen us finish anywhere from first place (last clinched in 1998) to dead last (most recently in 2021). </p><p>Here, we look back at all 65 UK entries to see how they hold up, from the ridiculous to the sublime.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">65. Jemini, Cry Baby, 2003 </h2><p>Now notorious for its \"nul points\" last-place result, every part of this song is a mess. The Liverpool pop duo have since admitted that their performance was out of tune. They claimed they couldn't hear the backing track. Unfortunately, we could.  </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">64. James Newman, Embers, 2021</h2><p>In other hands, this could have been mediocre. In Newman's it was a car-crash. Flanked by giant trumpets (a nod to the tune's parping synth-brass), and wearing a collection of zips held together with faux-leather, Newman sang like a dad having a go at karaoke after a few pints, not a contestant for the world's most-watched musical event. Seemingly short of breath and struggling to hit even the few notes the song required, he deserved every one of his nul points.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">63. Ryder, Runner in the Night, 1986</h2><p>Just listen to that horrible, squelching synth bass. Led by charisma-vacuum Maynard Williams, this manufactured sextet were an unprecedented flop in the pop charts. Unlike our previous Eurovision entries, Ryder's offering couldn't even crawl into the UK Top 75. No wonder: it sounds like a rejected Survivor B-side. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">62. Daz Sampson, Teenage Life, 2006</h2><p>This misguided hiphop effort paired ageing rapper Daz Sampson with a group of girls in school uniforms. Their catchy \"kiddie\" chorus aims at the youthful rebellion Pink Floyd captured in 'Another Brick in the Wall (Part II)', but combined with Sampson it sounds more like Tim Westwood freestyling over a primary-school assembly.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">61. Joe and Jake, You're Not Alone, 2016</h2><p>Pasteurised leftovers from The Voice, Joe and Jake were as thrilling as low-fat yogurt. I loathed the bland, corporate greige of this by-the-numbers pop effort at the time, but listening to it years later - after all those pandemic-era reassurances that \"you're not alone\" - it now seems an innocent relic of a simpler time. Still dull, though.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">60. Blue, I Can, 2011</h2><p>Until 2011, nobody thought they'd be looking back fondly at the \"good\" days of Blue. But this synth-y sprawl was a new low for the once successful boy band. \"I know I can... get back up again,\" they sang. They couldn't. The song came an undistinguished 10th. In the years that followed, every member of the band revealed themselves to be not only musically but also financially bankrupt.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">59. Scooch, Flying the Flag (For You), 2007 </h2><p>Everything that felt fresh about Gina G's 1996 disco hit was regurgitated here as electropop. Desperately angling for camp classic status (which they have, regrettably, since achieved), Scooch had one of the laziest gimmicks of any UK Eurovision entry: \"Let's dress as airline stewards! Because we're singing a song about flying!\" An eight-hour delay on Ryanair would be more fun than this.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">58. Nicki French, Don't Play That Song Again, 2000</h2><p>The title says it all. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">56. Black Lace, Mary Ann, 1979 </h2><p>It may not be Black Lace's worst crime against humanity (that would be '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POv-3yIPSWc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agadoo</a>') but this country-inflected rock flop was still tripe. A generous listener might call those growling vocals a nod to London's then-vital punk scene, but this wearisome, nudge-wink performance is closer to George Formby than Johnny Rotten.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">56. Emma, Give a Little Love Back to the World, 1990</h2><p>Almost as bad as Black Lace's humour was Emma's queasy earnestness. \"We should be proud of all the great things we've achieved,\" this environmental mope begins, like a particularly woolly episode of <em>Thought for the Day</em>. Don't blame the 15-year-old singer, who gives a solid enough performance. Blame the song's writer, one-man Europop factory Paul Curtis, who – after penning The Shadows' excellent 1975 entry – has churned out more than 20 Eurovision contenders (mostly rejected in the A Song for Europe contest).</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">55. Samantha Janus, A Message to Your Heart, 1991 </h2><p>Song-smith Paul Curtis was back in Bob Geldof mode with this preachy power-ballad, reminding the audience that \"through politics and ignorance / half the world's in need\". Janus made more of an impression on TV viewers a few years later as Ronnie Mitchell in EastEnders.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">54. Josh Dubovie, That Sounds Good To Me, 2010</h2><p>It might have sounded good to you, Josh, but it didn't to anyone else.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">53. Lindsay D, No Dream Impossible, 2001</h2><p>Actually, Lindsay, one dream is impossible: a UK Eurovision win this century. This would have been merely disappointing (rather than gnawingly awful) if it weren't for the bandana-wearing meathead who interrupted Ms D to offer motivational titbits such as \"be strong\" and \"keep pushin' on and on\", all while pretending he knew how to play the synth. </p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">52. Michael Rice, Bigger than Us, 2019</h2><p>Meh. This serviceable but uninteresting entry was second-hand, fell-off-the-back-of-a-lorry pop. It was written for Sweden's Eurovision entry John Lundvik to perform at a different contest, Melodifestivalen. Lundvik wisely decided he didn't want it, so we took it. X Factor reject Michael Rice placed last in the whole contest, which felt a little harsh: there was nothing distinctly <em>wrong</em> with Rice or the song, albeit nothing right either. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">51. Rikki, Only the Light, 1987</h2><p>This drab ballad – a flop in both the contest and the charts – was a grim foreshadowing of things to come. Listen past the Eighties synth, and in those overwrought vocals you'll find the germ of every cringeworthy, sub-X-Factor number we've put forward in recent years. Utterly hopeless.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">50. Precious, Say it Again, 1999</h2><p>Alright, I'll say it again: utterly hopeless. Unlike Rikki, however, Precious had a future – one member of the girl group, Jenny Frost, went on to release three number one singles with Atomic Kitten.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">49. Prima Donna, Love Enough for Two, 1980</h2><p>Billed as \"a group specially formed for the competition\", Prima Donna was the Frankenstein's monster of Eurovision, bolted together from a former New Seeker, a future Bardo member and the brother of someone in Bucks Fizz. They were introduced on the night by Noel Edmonds, and even he – a man who believes in melon-sized, invisible karmic orbs – seemed skeptical about their chances. The song may have been rubbish, but the early Eighties fashion (block colours and high-waisted trousers) was on point.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">48. Electro Velvet, Still in Love with You, 2015</h2><p>Electro-swing had a brief moment of popularity at the beginning of the 2010s; 'We No Speak Americano' was a number one hit in 2010, and genre acts like The Correspondents were earning critical acclaim. But by 2015, that moment had passed. The same year that hipster bible <em>Vice </em>magazine labelled electro-swing \"The Worst Genre Of Music In The World\", we put forward an electro-swing duo as our Eurovision entry. Despite their razor-sharp dress-sense, Electro Velvet were like a pair of guests who turn up to a party after midnight, sober and uncomfortable, just as everyone else is leaving.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">47. Co-Co, The Bad Old Days, 1978</h2><p>\"I was lost for learnin’ like a song without a key...\" Indeed. That lyric was a little on-the-nose for this wobbly, unmemorable performance. It came in 11th place, at the time Britain's worst Eurovision result to date. Co-Co's Cheryl Baker would find a better vehicle for her talents three years later, in Bucks Fizz.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">46. Sandie Shaw, Puppet on a String, 1967</h2><p>All right, yes, this was our first Eurovision winner. But it shouldn't have been. Shaw looks dead behind the eyes throughout this wretched oompah nightmare. \"I was instinctively repelled by its sexist drivel and cuckoo-clock tune,\" the barefoot pop star has since confessed. She's not the only one.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">45. Lulu, Boom Bang-a-Bang, 1969</h2><p>Our second winner was better, but not much better, sounding like the score to a Bavarian children's cartoon. After her excellent work on 'Shout' and the title tune to 1967 film To Sir, with Love, Lulu let herself down here. This is the way the Sixties end, not with a bang-a-bang but a whimper.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">44. Live Report, Why Do I Always Get it Wrong?, 1989</h2><p>Another weepy ballad, sung by a bald man barely clinging on to his ponytail. Despite the lacklustre performance and questionable fashion choices (shoestring tie, leather tuxedo jacket, beige trousers), the judges still found something to admire here: it came in second place, with the most perfect 12 scores of the evening.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">43. Lucie Jones, Never Give Up On You, 2017</h2><p>\"Siri, sing me a Celine Dion B-side.\" Welsh model Jones tried in vain to inject any energy, humanity or warmth into this sluggish anthem-by-numbers. Its lyrics were roundly mocked on social media due to its unfortunate timing; this was our first Eurovision entry since the Brexit referendum, when Britain told Europe that we were, in fact, quite happy to give up on you.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">42. Scott Fitzgerald, Go, 1988</h2><p>Inhale deeply. Breathe in that cheese. Like a fine Camembert, this slice of overblown schmaltz has only ripened over time, and now has a perverse kitsch appeal. Written by Bruce Forsyth's daughter Julie, it unbelievably came within a whisker of winning, reaching an undeserved second-place. As his Gatsby-writing namesake once put it, \"Nothing is as obnoxious as other people's luck\".</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">41. Olivia Newton John, Long Live Love, 1974</h2><p>As John Travolta would later sing, \"Why, Sandy, why-yi-yi?\" Before she found big-screen fame in <em>Grease</em>, the fabulous Olivia Newton John gritted her teeth through this choppy marching tune. Snapping out the words \"HAP-PY PEO-PLE\", she sounded like she was planning to bite open their jugulars. The song is ostensibly about the Salvation Army, and that military rhythm gives it a strangely oppressive feel. It's like something they might play over a tannoy at Disneyland North Korea.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">40. Pearl Carr &amp; Teddy Johnson, Sing, Little Birdie, 1958</h2><p>Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a husband-and-wife double act. Carr and Johnson gawp inanely as the little birdie flies past their gaze (brought to life by the orchestra's piccolo). \"Sing, little birdie up above / Sing a song of love!\" Those with the highest tolerance for twee might enjoy it; for everyone else, it makes a strong case for the benefits of bird flu.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">39. Ronnie Carroll, Ring-A-Ding Girl, 1962</h2><p>This starts off with such promise. With his dark good looks and strong, even tenor, Belfast-born Carroll seduces us through the opening bars – before launching into a chorus so irritating it has been proven to give listeners mumps. Ring-ding-a-do? Ring-ding-a-don't.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">38. Ronnie Carroll, Say Wonderful Things, 1963</h2><p>Back to make amends for 1962, Carroll returned to Sing Forgettable Things flanked by three identical chorus girls. It's an improvement on his previous effort (though both songs came in fourth place). A nice walking guitar-riff elevates this above mere slush.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">37. Cliff Richard, Congratulations, 1968</h2><p>It may still be popular, but that insufferable earworm of a tune is really nothing to congratulate. Still, Sir Cliff's knee-popping dance moves deserve a smattering of applause. They certainly made an impression at the time: after one particularly impressive backward hop, his female fans could be heard shrieking with excitement.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">36. Vikki, Love Is..., 1985</h2><p>Vikki's under-powered power-ballad may not have been prize material, but her hair stylist certainly deserved a trophy. After Eurovision, the song sank without a trace. Vikki has since renamed herself Aeone, and relaunched her career with more success as an LA-based ambient folk singer.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">35. Belle and the Devotions, Love Games, 1984</h2><p>It may be mediocre, but 'Love Games' didn't deserve the booing it received on the night. Really, it was the England football team that the Luxembourg audience were booing, after the fans' atrocious behaviour at a match in the Duchy the previous year. Not for the last time, an otherwise innocuous Eurovision entry was sunk by politics.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">34. Clodagh Rodgers, Jack In The Box, 1971</h2><p>A tune so relentlessly perky it needs medical sedation. Northern Irish singer Rodgers throws herself into it heartily, but neither her vocal talent nor her eyeball-itching pink outfit can make this novelty jingle a classic. Not great, but at least it's not Puppet on a String.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">33. Jade Ewen, It's My Time, 2009</h2><p>By the end of the Noughties, not even Andrew Lloyd Webber could lift the UK out of its decade-long Euro-malaise. He not only wrote this disappointingly un-hummable tune, but also played piano for Ewen at the contest. Despite the beige lyrics (courtesy of Diane Warren) and competent but unremarkable melody, Lloyd Webber's international cachet and some canny pre-competition promotion elevated'It's My Time' to a very respectable fifth place. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">32. Jessica Garlick, Come Back, 2002</h2><p>The exact mid-point of the Eurovision spectrum. A song neither brilliant nor awful, entirely without distinguishing features. Written by Martyn Baylay, an airline pilot from Birmingham, this ballad is a kind of pop yardstick: the relative success of any song on this list can be measured against it. In other words, from here on things can only get better.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">31. Bryan Johnson: Looking High, High, High, 1960</h2><p>Ah, the tale of a charming baritone stalker, hunting high and low for his runaway woman. Barring an unsuccessfully whistled interlude, and its questionable sexual politics, this is actually rather fun. Out-of-work stage actor Johnson serves up ham with relish. When he sings \"You sure could have knocked me down / With the proverbial feather,\" he looks like he means it.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">30. Kenneth McKellar, A Man Without Love, 1966</h2><p>\"A man without love is only half a man...\" Audiences were treated to a rare glimpse of the lower half of a man, as McKellar – then king of the Scottish panto circuit – took the stage in a kilt. He gave an impassioned performance of this earnest tune, lent a little sauce by the occasional glimpse of a Caledonian kneecap.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">29. The Allisons, Are You Sure?, 1961</h2><p>It's the Sixties, baby! Pop had arrived, albeit in the meekest form imaginable. Erzatz brothers \"John and Bob Allison\" (Brian Alford and Colin Day) smile politely through this soapy clean, barbershop-flavoured duet. Lovely voices, though – so smooth they glide in one ear and straight out the other.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">28. Javine, Touch My Fire, 2005</h2><p>Now, some cynics have claimed that Javine Hylton only won the televised pre-selection contest due to her unfortunate, Janet Jackson-style wardrobe malfunction. But that does her a disservice. 'Touch My Fire's saucy, bangra-infused R&amp;B was miles better than the song tipped by bookies to represent the UK that year, Katie Price's Auto-tune train-wreck 'Not Just Anybody'. Still, when it came to the actual Eurovision Song Contest it flopped badly, coming in 22nd out of 24.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">27. James Fox, Hold On To Our Love, 2004</h2><p>A likeable, and refreshingly simple, mid-tempo acoustic guitar song (with Fox's brother Dean on drums). Disappointingly for the UK, it only came in 16th. His unexpectedly low ranking sparked accusations of voter bias from such expert pundits as Terry Wogan, Bucks Fizz singer Cheryl Baker and, erm, Fox's mum. In hindsight, though, the result was perhaps down to their unglitzy performance rather than any fiendish tactical voting.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">26. Frances Ruffelle, We Will Be Free (Lonely Symphony), 1994</h2><p>The funky slap-bass and sultry vocals of the verse made this a decent, even enjoyable entry, while the note-bending chorus allowed Ruffelle to show off lung-capacity that would land her star roles in several West End musicals. And yet, the two halves never quite gel together, making this a near-miss rather than a smash hit.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">25. Mae Muller, I Wrote a Song</h2><p>Hopes are high for this year’s entry, a tale of revenge told in faintly Latin-tinged club-pop. The lyrics boast of how the singer has got her own back on the ex who dumped her, by writing a kick-ass song about it (this very song, in fact). Now, I love a bit of self-reflexive meta-pop as much as the next chap, but as the song builds and builds, Muller’s precision-tooled hooks – at least, in the music video – never quite deliver the wild abandon they promise. But the live performance might just take flight. Keep your fingers crossed.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">24. Andy Abraham, Even If, 2008</h2><p>The first X Factor reject to represent us, but by no means the last. A groovy, cheeky, upbeat soul number with a head-bobbing rhythm, Even If was our best Eurovision entry of the Noughties, and yet – undeservedly – came at the very bottom of the table. Perhaps there is something to those rumours of tactical voting, after all.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">23. Sweet Dreams, I'm Never Giving Up, 1983</h2><p>Dressed in primary-coloured sportswear and chunky headbands, teenage trio Sweet Dreams couldn't have looked more Eighties if they tried. With its anthemic opening chords and up-tempo chorus, it's aged far better than anyone would have expected at the time (the song placed sixth, and failed to make a splash in the charts).</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">22. Brotherhood of Man, Save Your Kisses for Me, 1976</h2><p>This was, at the time, the biggest-selling Eurovision winner in history. From those syrupy I-love-you's to the unambitious dance routine (check out that synchronised hand-holding!) this is a relic from a simpler age. You'll find no better example of wide-eyed romantic love... until the punch-line comes: the beloved \"baby\" is actually a baby. A three-year-old. Surprise!</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">21. Bardo, One Step Further, 1982</h2><p>Underrated at the time (it only reached seventh place), this punchy duet from Crackerjack presenter Sally Ann Triplett and her real-life lover Stephen Fischer benefited from the couple's palpable chemistry. It's upbeat pop with hooks aplenty, and would sit well on any Eurovision mix-tape. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">20. SuRie, Storm, 2018</h2><p>You won't find a better example of \"keep calm and carry on\" spirit than SuRie, who was interrupted in the final by a stage invader, who wrenched the microphone out of her hands. The classically trained singer carried on valiantly nonetheless, winning the goodwill of the crowd. The song itself was good – an optimistic, club-friendly anthem –  but it's the performance on the night that earns this one a place in the top 20.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">19. Imaani, Where Are You, 1998</h2><p>Imaani Saleem's soulful vocals gave 'Where Are You' a real emotional punch, but the backing track – and flat drum machine effects – have dated the song terribly. On the other hand, it has since taken on a symbolic importance as the last song that gave the UK a chance of winning: Imaani came in second place, a feat we haven't matched since.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">18. Michael Ball, One Step Out of Time, 1992</h2><p>Another guilty pleasure, made all the sweeter by Ball's shameless dad-dancing. Terry Wogan raved about it, your parents probably love it, and after a few drinks it'll have you pumping your fists at any Eurovision party.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">17. Bonnie Tyler, Believe in Me, 2013</h2><p>If it didn't quite reach the heights of 'Total Eclipse of the Heart', this was at least a Dark Afternoon of the Kidney. Tyler struggled audibly on the first line, but soon recovered for a powerful and impassioned performance, with a lifetime's worth of feeling: \"You never see the rainbow, you just curse the rain\". The critics certainly saw the rainbow, giving this two Eurovision Song Contest Radio Awards for best song and best singer, but the actual contest voters rained on her parade – 'Believe in Me' placed a disappointing 19th. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">16. Engelbert Humperdinck, Love Will Set You Free, 2012</h2><p>Much like Bonnie Tyler, this was another attempt to win Eurovision with a fine-but-weathered singer dredged up from your mum's record collection. If poor old Engelbert had sung this for the UK back in the Sixties, he would have easily made it into the top five. Sadly, this beautiful Latin-tinged waltz number arrived several decades too late. Tastes had moved on, and the septuagenarian crooner was cruelly snubbed by voters, placing second-last. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">15. Matt Monro, I Love The Little Things, 1964 </h2><p>Sadly, no video footage survives of this performance. But the audio proves Matt \"The Man with the Golden Voice\" Monro lived up to his moniker. Despite the uninspiring lyrics (\"My love, I'm so in love with you\"), he sings this upbeat tune with the same warmth he brought to 1963's 'From Russia with Love'. It came in a well-deserved second place.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">14. Sonia, Better the Devil You Know, 1993</h2><p>Proof that everything sounds better on a keytar. Liverpool's Sonia should have won with this irresistible, dancefloor-filling rock'n'roll froth, but came in second to Ireland's Niamh Kavanagh.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">13. Gina G, Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit, 1996</h2><p>This was perhaps the first time that our Eurovision entry was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/just-little-bit-crooked-gina-gs-ooh-aah-eurovision-glory-stolen/\">ahead of the pop curve</a>. With its pumping disco beat, computerised backing track and hyper-athletic dance routine, it looks ahead to Noughties hits from (at best) Girls Aloud and (at worst) Scooter. A fun fact: that tiny dress Gina wore for the contest was originally designed for Cher.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">12. The New Seekers, Beg, Steal or Borrow, 1972</h2><p>From billowing sleeves to velvet tuxedos, The New Seekers had their Eurovision look nailed to perfection. Their song wasn't half bad, either, with its neat harmonies and catchy singalong chorus. Another second-place result for Britain, and a far-better-than-second-rate entry.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">11. Molly, Children of the Universe, 2014</h2><p>People love to gripe about the UK's diminished status at Eurovision, but the last few years (Joe and Jake excepted) have been a vast improvement on the Noughties. Young Molly Smitten-Downes wrote this rabble-rousing anthem herself – the first UK act to do so since Katrina and the Waves – and the results were surprisingly very good. That \"power to the people\" refrain packs a wallop, even if the political statement underpinning it remains vague.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">10. Lynsey de Paul and Mike Moran, Rock Bottom, 1977</h2><p>Not just a fun, honky-tonk tune, but also a rather memorable performance. Moran and de Paul were dressed in fetching Edwardian morning-suits, sat back-to-back playing a pair of duelling grand pianos. Not everything has to be a life-or-death love ballad: 'Rock Bottom' proves a little light amusement can go a long way. The duo deserve bonus-points for somehow making the whole thing look understated.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">9. Love City Groove, Love City Groove, 1995</h2><p>Our first foray into Eurovision hip-hop was widely mocked at the time. And yet, two decades on, it's hard to resist that funky chorus. It may not be typical Eurovision fare, but who can argue with Q-Tee's logic when she raps, \"You know I'm the one to rock your world, because... honey, yeah.\" 'Love City Groove' is in fact an unappreciated Euro-gem – because honey, yeah?</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">8. Cliff Richard, Power to All Our Friends, 1973</h2><p>By 1973, the hippie movement was dead – except at Eurovision. Sir Cliff's backing band included a guitarist in round John Lennon glasses and an oversized bongo. Extolling the virtues of the simple life (\"ploughing in the valley\"), Richard segues confidently between soft, earnest verse and brassy, rocking chorus. \"Power to the bees!\" Who can argue with that?</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">7. Patricia Bredin, All, 1957</h2><p>A nostalgic delight. The lyrics promise \"all the joy of living\" and \"all the golden dreams of yesterday\"; half a century on, this Vera Lynn-esque number serves them up on a silver plate. An amateur opera singer from Hull, our first ever entry was clearly pleased as punch to be there. Bredin's vowels may be cold as glass, but she performs with a smile and a glint in her eye.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">6. Mary Hopkin, Knock Knock Who's There, 1970</h2><p>There's an oddly poignant edge to this sweet, upbeat number from Welsh siren Hopkin. Paul McCartney was a big fan, and it's easy to see why. Her shimmering vocals took her to second place, pipped to the post by Irish singer Dana.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">5. Bucks Fizz, Making Your Mind Up, 1981</h2><p>Colourful, cheeky and exactly the right kind of naff – there's a reason our winning 1981 team are still so popular among Eurovisionistas: it's everything we want from the competition. That skirt-ripping dance routine (the big reveal timed to match the lyric \"if you want to see some more\"), deserves a place on any list of the contest's most memorable moments. Let's overlook the fact that (whisper it) Fizz's actual singing was more flat than sparkling.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">4. The Shadows, Let Me Be the One, 1975</h2><p>Cliff Richard's one-time backing band were better off without him. They were the first proper rock group to represent the UK, and couldn't have looked more laid back about the whole thing. When singer Bruce Welch briefly flubbed his words onstage, he might have got away with it unnoticed – but he chose not to, leaning into the microphone to joke with the crowd \"I knew it\".  Not only does this loose-limbed, Beatles-y number succeed as a song in its own right, but it also has that most elusive quality: authenticity.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">3. Sam Ryder, Spaceman, 2022</h2><p>We'd spent most of the 21st century in the Eurovision doldrums, but found an unlikely space-faring saviour in Sam Ryder – looking uncannily like Sam Rockwell's Zaphod Beeblebrox, in the much-maligned Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Film. I'm still riding the giddy high of last year's result, which saw the UK rocket up to second place – just behind Ukraine – with our catchiest entry in decades. \"I'm up in space, man,\" is a jet-propelled earworm for the ages, from a likeable chap with serious rock chops and an ecstatic falsetto. A pan-galactic gargle-blaster of a hit.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">2. Kathy Kirby, I Belong, 1965</h2><p>Blonde bombshell Kirby's wide-eyed zeal on this self-empowerment anthem brought her cult fame as an enduring gay icon. Bold and fiery, it was our first Sixties entry that actually sounded like the music the kids were listening to, and would have been a worthy winner – if it weren't nudged down into second place by Luxembourg's equally radical entry, the Serge Gainsbourg-penned 'Poupée de cire, poupée de son'.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">1. Katrina and the Waves, Love Shine a Light, 1997</h2><p>Sometimes, the simple ones are the best. In 1997, Katrina and the Waves' peak (with Eighties hits like Walking on Sunshine) was long behind them. They had nothing to lose, and threw themselves into this optimistic anthem with utter conviction. In other hands it might have been pure cheese, but Katrina Leskanich's breathy, all-or-nothing performance gives it an unexpected power.</p>\n",

      "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/concerts/why-eurovision-song-contest-2023-still-matters-european/\">Eurovision Song Contest 2023</a> is underway - and taking place in the UK for the first time since 1998. All eyes turn to Liverpool, as the nation pins its hopes on <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/05/07/bbc-didnt-tell-off-anti-boris-tweets-eurovision-mae-muller/\">Mae Muller</a>, whose I Wrote a Song has already broken into the pop charts (a promising sign). </p><p>But does she stand a chance against Norway's goth Lady Gaga, Moldova's Neolithic flutes and an Austrian number supposedly written by the ghost of Edgar Allen Poe?</p><p>Only 26 songs will make it to the Grand Final, shown on BBC One at 8pm on Saturday May 13. Eleven acts have been eliminated following two <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2023/05/10/eurovision-song-contest-first-semi-final-tv-review/\">first semi-finals</a>. Here’s our countdown of 10 artists well placed to sweep up those precious douze points, plus the other finalists and the songs that fell by the wayside:</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">The top 10: our predictions</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">1. Finland</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Käärijä – Cha Cha Cha</h2><p>It turns out it IS easy being green. Finnish rapper Käärijä went into the contest already one of the favourites. But with his emerald-hued “Hulk” arms, human centipede dance routines and Prodigy-if-they-were-on-kids-TV vibes he has captured the imagination of Eurovision viewers. With the final approaching he remains a front-runner.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">2. Sweden </h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Loreen – Tattoo</h2><p>Watch out Johnny Logan – your record as the only singer with two Eurovision victories is under threat. Loreen previously bagged the prize in 2012. Now she’s back with a serving of frosty electro-pop – and choreography involving her looking nonplussed as two flat-screen TVs attempt to squish her. It’s certainly bombastic – but does she live up to the hype? All will be revealed on Saturday night.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">3. Austria</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Teya &amp; Salena – Who The Hell Is Edgar?</h2><p>Wet Leg and Eighties cyberpunk absurdist Max Headroom are among the influences tapped by Gen Z pop pranksters Teya &amp; Salena. Going into Eurovision they were already regarded as potential dark horses. But after storming the semi-finals with the ditty about the ghost of Edgar Allan Poe, they have surely gone from novelty to genuine contenders. You would have to be stark raven mad to rule them out.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">4. Israel</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Noa Kirel – Unicorn</h2><p>Some Eurovision performers look like a grainy facsimile of a pop star. And then there’s the real thing. Very much in the second category is “Israel’s Jennifer Lopez”, who combined powerhouse vocals with blistering dancing in her semi-final. </p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p> </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">5. Ukraine</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Tvorchi – Heart Of Steel</h2><p>Synth duos are a pop staple, from the Pet Shop Boys to Eurythmics. But they’ve never had much of a look-in at Eurovision. That might change with Ukraine pairing Tvorchi, whose entry combines a defiant anti-war message – something everyone in Ukraine would know about – with soulful pop.   </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">6. United Kingdom</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Mae Muller – I Wrote A Song</h2><p>Muller has been a likeable ambassador for the UK this week. There is also the spooky fact that she was born in 1997, the last time the UK triumphed at Eurovision (via Katrina and the Waves). Is her song as epic as it needs to be, though? There was that weird moment in the semi-final when the hosts tried to lead the audience through the chorus of I Wrote A Song and it all sputtered out slightly. Then, the second semi was muted anyway. Perhaps Saturday will be when Muller takes flight.  </p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">7. Czechia</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Vesna – My Sister’s Crown</h2><p>It’s easy to be wacky at Eurovision. And it’s also relatively straightforward to come to the contest with a catchy song. The real challenge is combining the two – a feat Prague troupe Vesna carries off with a flute-fuelled banger that gives off big folk horror energy whilst also containing a cracking chorus.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">8. Norway </h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Alessandra – Queen Of Kings</h2><p>If Game of Thrones was a hi-NRG Eurovision stomper then it would sound a lot like baroque bopper Queen of Kings. The song is bright and busy and, with lyrics that celebrate Alessandra’s bisexuality, on point with its LGBTQ message. But she seemed nervous in Tuesday's semi-final. The question is whether she can quell the butterflies as she takes to the biggest stage of all.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">9. France</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">La Zarra – Évidemment</h2><p>Before becoming an international celebration of riotous pop, Eurovision was a feast of power ballads. And that is the tradition taken up by La Zarra, whose cool-to-the-touch torch song sounds as if it is urgently in need of a Bond movie to soundtrack. France’s Eurovision record is even worse than the UK’s: it hasn’t won since 1977. It’s not clear that La Zarra will end that losing streak. But she is well-placed to make a splash and restore some gallic pride and joy.  </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">10. Australia</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Voyager – Promise</h2><p>This could be Australia’s final year at Eurovision as its agreement with the EBU has now ended and is up for renegotiation. But what a stunning farewell it would be if Voyager were to place highly. Promise is a slab of roguish synthwave that sounds like Mad Max fronting Wham! – i.e. the perfect Eurovision mix of straight-faced and silly. They went down well in the second semi: you have to love a performance that begins with the lead singer pretending to drive an Eighties hatch-back. The final could be their chance to shine. </p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">The other finalists</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Albania</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Albina &amp; Familja Kelmendi – Duje</h2><p>A roof-raising ballad inspired by an apocryphal Mother Theresa quote –“What can you do to promote world peace? Go home and love your family” – performed by a runner-up on The Voice of Albania, with accompanying harmonies by five members of her family, including her mother and father. That’s a lot and yet somehow it stays aloft.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Armenia</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Brunette – Future Lover</h2><p>A blistering torch song that sounds like a cross between a glum Ellie Goulding and Billie Eilish’s No Time To Die. Brunette, aka 21-year-old Elen Yeremyan, threatens to break into a rap halfway through but then calms down and goes back to channelling a Grimdark Adele.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Belgium</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Gustaph – Because of You</h2><p>Bangers don’t come any… bangier than this whomping house number celebrating the LGBT community in which Gustaph found love and acceptance. A Scissor Sisters revival is overdue and Gustaph sounds keen to fire the starter pistol.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Croatia</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Let 3 – Mama ŠČ!</h2><p>Fake moustaches, slightly pervy military outfits and a song that sounds like Sparks fronted by Freddie Mercury. No faulting Croatia’s entry for ambition or lack of inhibition, then. For those who appreciate the weirder side of Eurovision, it is fantastically bonkers.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Cyprus</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Andrew Lambrou – Break a Broken Heart</h2><p>A blokey ballad on rocket boots from Sydney-born Lambrou. His look screams one-man New Kids on the Block while the song suggests a more than passing affinity with the repertoire of Lewis Capaldi.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Estonia</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Alika – Bridges</h2><p>Another big Eurovision ballad, though the pianos at the start are a bit Tori Amos. We’re soon back in familiar territory, however – that territory being Adele meets Emeli Sandé.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Germany</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Lord Of The Lost – Blood &amp; Glitter</h2><p>The spirit of Eurovision winners Lordi – and Teuton metal overlords Rammstein – infuses an absurdist glam-metal stomper from Hamburg’s Lord of the Lost. Kudos to all involved for keeping straight faces from start to finish.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Italy</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Marco Mengoni – Due Vite</h2><p>An old school ballad about finding strength after a nasty romantic split. Mengoni isn’t taking any risks with this traditional tear-jerker. Perhaps that will stand out amidst the apocalyptic pop which seems set to dominate Eurovision at Liverpool.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Lithuania</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Monika Linkyte – Stay</h2><p>Orbiting themes of depression and redemption, Stay is a proper tear-jerker from Linkyte, who previously represented Lithuania at Eurovision 2015. Quietly catchy – but too understated for Eurovision?</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Moldova</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Pasha Parfeni – Soarele şi Luna</h2><p>If at first, you don’t succeed… then record a pagan-pop rocker that owes more than a little to the neo-Viking pop of Heilung. This is Pasha Parfeni’s third tilt at Eurovision – and, with its Neolithic flutes and industrial grooves, he’s going for broke.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Norway</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Alessandra – Queen Of Kings</h2><p>Gothic Lady Gaga is the signature sound of several of this year’s Eurovision entrants – and none more so than the entry by former Voice Norway entrant Alessandra Mele. She describes Queen Of Kings as a celebration of her life as a bisexual woman. Another way of putting would be a Euro-trance Dead Can Dance.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Poland</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Blanka – Solo</h2><p>The spirit of Dua Lipa is conjured with a breezy effort from former Poland’s Top Model contest Blanka Stajkow.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Portugal</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Mimicat – Ai Coração</h2><p>Cabaret meets the disco in a quirky bopper from a former estate agent Marisa Mena, who lists Jill Scott, Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Charles as influences.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Serbia</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Luke Black – Samo Mi Se Spava</h2><p>You wait for years for a Eurovision entry inspired by Nine Inch Nails and now, on the heels of Latvia’s entry, comes a second one. The first-ever Serbian artist signed by Universal Records, Black has poured his post-lockdown angst into a noir-ish slab of cyberpop. It’s essentially NIN’s Pretty Hate Machine goes inter-railing. And yet, there’s no arguing with its claustrophobic punch.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Slovenia</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Joker Out – Carpe Diem</h2><p>One of the year’s more anonymous entries – it’s The Killers meets The 1975, without the attitude or the spark.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Spain</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Blanca Paloma – Eaea</h2><p>Rosalía is Spain’s biggest pop star since Julio Iglesias – so it is no surprise that her cybernetic flamenco sound has filtered down to Eurovision, as can be heard in Eaea, from costume-designer turned Euro contender Paloma.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Switzerland</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Remo Forrer – Watergun</h2><p>Piano ballads are not renowned for their upbeat messages – but this year’s Eurovision crop is nonetheless notably bleak. “I don’t want to be a soldier, I don’t want to play with real blood,” sings Remo Forrer on a slow-burn outing that suggests Keane going out of their way to be depressing.</p><hr/><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-large u-heading-style-colour\">Eliminated in the semi-finals</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Azerbaijan</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">TuralTuranX – Tell Me More</h2><p>Twins Tural and Turan Bağmanov channel the Ed Sheeran within on an acoustic rap number that mourns a recent break-up and hopes for reconciliation. Slight but very sweet. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Denmark</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Reiley – Breaking My Heart</h2><p>With the 1975’s Matty Healy <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/05/04/why-taylor-swift-love-englishman-matty-healy/\">being otherwise occupied</a>, there is an opening for future funk indie and that is the genre championed by Danish waif Rani Petersen on Breaking My Heart. It’s catchy but the Matty Healy-ness of the whole thing may be a deal breaker for some (presumably not Taylor Swift). </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Georgia</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Iru – Echo</h2><p>Irina Khechanovi will be at home on stage in Liverpool, having previously won Junior Eurovision. She’s back with a languid bopper that gives big Billie Eilish vibes. It’s pop with a goth streak. The lyrics are largely in English – apart from that section of the chorus where she starts to chirrup in a made-up language (Chamgaraga-ga-chamgara). </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Greece</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Victor Vernicos – What They Say</h2><p>The youngest contest this year 16-year-old Vernicos may have heard the odd George Ezra song, you suspect. But he puts his stamp on the sensitive lad-next-door formula with stomping beats and heart-on-sleeve lyrics. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Iceland</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Diljá – Power</h2><p>Diljá Pétursdóttir trained as a gymnast and pulls all sorts of shapes on a Kim Petras-style banger. Iceland has a track record in sending quirky acts to Eurovision – most recently the supremely droll Daði Freyr. But Power plays it straight – for better or worse. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Ireland </h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Wild Youth – We Are One</h2><p>Though already popular back home (Niall Horan is a fan) Wild Youth have had to fend off accusations that their Eurovision entry is Chat GPT U2. And that was before they sacked their choreographer over comments on social media – only to be accused of homophobia by JK Rowling. After all that they could do with a stroke of luck – though their song may be too generic for Eurovision. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Latvia</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Sudden Lights – Aijā</h2><p>Are you ready to rock? Sudden Lights is, with a twitchy chugger that sounds like Nine Inch Nails collaborating with Tom Odell. Brave, if nothing else.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Malta</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">The Busker – Dance (Our Own Party)</h2><p>Malta is here for the good vibes with a sax-fuelled romper and a chorus that begins with the line “I feel good in my sweater”. So, Eurovision Where’s Me Jumper? </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Netherlands</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Mia Nicolai &amp; Dion Cooper – Burning Daylight</h2><p>Another piano intro and an understated vocal. But the generic quality of Burning Daylight is offset by a gorgeous melody and chemistry between Nicolai and Cooper. It’s a grower – but will that work at Eurovision, not an environment known for its long attention span? </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Romania</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Theodor Andrei – DGT (Off and On)</h2><p>The Euro family doesn’t know quite what to make of this provocative number written from the perspective of a lover whose partner tries to dominate them through sex. You don’t need to speak Romanian to work this out – the live performance features 19-year-old Andrei being bossed about by scantily-clad dancers. It’s out there – but at least it doesn’t sound like Ed Sheeran, so full marks for breaking the mould. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">San Marino</h2><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">Piqued Jacks – Like An Animal</h2><p>“Cmon baby I can smelly you like an animal” is certainly memorable so far as opening lines go. The rest of the song by Piqued Jacks isn’t nearly so original – it’s essentially Gun N’ Roses meets Rolling Stones. Still, the quartet exude an infectious sense of fun. </p><hr/><p>Did you know you can bet on Eurovision?

      "<p>There is a well-established school of thought that Jordan Pickford will not unduly suffer if Everton are relegated.</p><p>The logic follows that there is zero chance England’s first-choice goalkeeper will drop into the Championship and as the most marketable Goodison asset in the event of a relegation fire sale, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/11/18/jordan-pickford-lined-successor-hugo-lloris-spurs-antonio-conte/\">Tottenham Hotspur or Manchester United might be tempted</a> to bid for him given their impending goalkeeping vacancies.</p><p>The same hypothesis was offered this time last year. Then, as now, there was nobody more adept at rendering such a theory irrelevant than Pickford himself.</p><p>Although a combination of factors preserved Everton’s Premier League status in 2022, and will be required to repeat the trick in the next three games, Pickford is the beating heart of successive survival efforts, saving his club millions as the formidable final barrier to relegation.</p><p>“Big players usually become big players because of big moments,” is Sean Dyche’s observation with regard’s Pickford’s contribution. Frank Lampard would have said likewise a year ago. During the run-in last season, Pickford’s individual performance in a win against Chelsea switched momentum just as Everton’s plight looked hopeless.</p><p>Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/01/leicester-city-vs-everton-premier-league-live-score-updates/\">Pickford’s recent penalty save to deny James Maddison</a> may be a turning point, the difference between his side falling 3-1 down or claiming a 2-2 draw at bottom-three rivals Leicester City two weeks ago.</p><p> And although <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/08/brighton-vs-everton-live-score-premier-league-latest-result/\">Everton were emphatic 5-1 winners at Brighton</a> earlier this week, a series of world-class Pickford saves early in the second half ensured a stirring home comeback never materialised.</p><p>Pickford would rather such performances contributed to winning trophies or European qualification, but consistency is rapidly turning cult status into one more befitting of a Goodison legend.</p><p>Such commitment was reflected in a new four-and-a-half year deal in February. Tellingly, there was no exit clause in the event of the drop. That formality may not have been necessary, but it was still a symbolic gesture revealing that if the worst-case scenario materialised, any separation would be mutually agreed. Pickford is self-evidently desperate to ensure there are no personal or boardroom dilemmas. </p><p>“It is a pretty good sign that he wants to be here,” said Dyche.</p><p> Dyche has become accustomed to working with top-class keepers, citing Nick Pope and Tom Heaton during his Burnley days. When asked to compare their qualities, he is diplomatic, recognising Pope among the rivals to Pickford’s England shirt.</p><p>“They are all different,” he said. “With his athleticism, shot-stopping his speed around the penalty area – that’s what I have noticed with Jordan. And his experience. He has a lot of experience at club and England level. That wraps into a package of a very good goalkeeper.”</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘He’s learning when to fire people up and when to be calm’</h2><p>There is another quality which has been acknowledged more frequently. Emotional maturity. As Everton’s captain in the absence of Seamus Coleman, Pickford has spoken to Dyche about being more selective with regards as and when to be at his most expressive.</p><p>“I’ve said that you can add into your game when to choose to be emotional and when to choose to be really on it,” said Dyche. “When to fire people up around you and when to be calm. That’s another learning curve. He’s getting older and wiser in his professional outlook. I’ve already had a quick chat with him about looking at the team, observing them, and seeing the pictures; the defensive planning picture from behind the back four. He’s adapting and using some of that and I’m pleased for him.</p><p>“I’ve never spoken to keepers about their technical handling or alignment or closing down space, but I’ve always spoken to them about the overview, like their tactical understanding, because as keepers mature they see it better. I think the best goalkeepers have done that so well down the years.”</p><p>Pickford will probably be at his busiest <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/12/pep-guardiola-eurovision-manchester-city-title-liverpool/\">when Manchester City come to Goodison on Sunday</a>.</p><p>Given Everton’s defensive vulnerabilities, it is no surprise Pickford is in the top three of most saves performed this season. More eye-catching is the fact he has completed more passes than Manchester City counterpart Ederson, and Pickford is one of only four goalkeepers with an assist to his name in this campaign (with Alisson, Ederson and Brighton’s Jason Steele).</p><p>Like England’s Gareth Southgate, Dyche has tuned in to how Pickford can be utilised as an attacking weapon, his desire to seek out Dominic Calvert-Lewin on the counter-attack a feature of recent fixtures.</p><p>“He strikes a really good ball,” said Dyche. “He has done that from a very young age. I remember being at Burnley and him playing for Preston in the FA Cup. He was just on the scene and his delivery was fantastic from the back.</p><p>“Ederson has been a big shift for Manchester City since they brought him in because he can play with real fire, hitting that  75-yarder, 12 feet in the air, with that ability to drill it a long distance.</p><p>“Without a doubt it is something we’ve spoken about using. Why wouldn’t you? This is the modern side of football. What can you use and how many different ways can you be effective? I want good football but I want effective football.”</p><p>Another key component of Everton’s survival bid will be required on Sunday – Goodison Park sure to be re-energised after successive encouraging away performances.</p><p>Pickford has proven himself a catalyst for increasing noise and belief, often celebrating saves as strikers would a goal.</p><p>“He shows it a bit more often,” said Dyche. “You want a bit of energy for the crowd and the feel of a performance. You want a natural reaction from players.”</p><p>Everton may be just a couple more Pickford first pumps from another great escape.</p>\n",

      "<p>“It’s not about me, it is definitely not about me.” It is a sentence that reveals much about Michael Carrick's approach to life as Middlesbrough manager. The humility, the humbleness and his calm leadership qualities that have seen him excel.</p><p>Middlesbrough were 21st in the Championship when Carrick, after a long pursuit by chairman Steve Gibson, was appointed in October last year. His remit was to save the club from relegation when he replaced Chris Wilder, but he has done far more than that.</p><p>On Sunday, Boro will take on Coventry City in the Championship play-off semi-finals and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/01/06/how-vincent-kompany-michael-carrick-became-championships-hottest/\">Carrick is already being talked about as one of the most exciting managerial prospects in the country</a>.</p><p>At the age of 41, the former West Ham, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United midfielder is proving an inspired choice. Middlesbrough is a club and town transformed.</p><p>Not since those exciting early years under Gibson in the mid-90s, when the club had Bryan Robson and Terry Venables as managers, and brought a host of famous players to Teesside, has there been such a feeling of excitement and confidence.</p><p>“I didn't really have a target or a goal when I first came in,” said Carrick, whose return to his native North East has given him a fresh perspective on life and work. “It was more a case of trying to improve, trying to develop the team and seeing where it took us.</p><p>“Of course, in the back of your mind, there's always that, in me being who I am, trying to achieve. You're always trying to be as good as you can possibly be.</p><p>“That's me sitting here as a coach and passing it on to the players, and then you see where you end up.</p><p>“This is where we've ended up and it doesn't really change what we do for the next game. It's still the same mindset of trying to improve, trying to win games and see where that takes us.”</p>\n",

      "<p>Boro are three games away from promotion to the Premier League for the first time since 2016. They finished fourth at the end of the regular season having, at one stage, looked like they were going to chase down Sheffield United in second.</p><p>Carrick is already adored by supporters, who had no idea he would have such a transformative impact.</p><p>As a player, the England international had always been one of the most intelligent on the pitch, a beautiful craftsman, as a deep-lying midfielder, but he was a rookie manager who had been part of Jose Mourinho’s coaching staff at Old Trafford. Interestingly, another member of the Portuguese’s staff at Manchester United  Kieran McKenna – has just guided Ipswich Town to promotion from League One.</p><p>Carrick is a completely different sort of character to Mourinho, but he was mentored by him and remains in regular contact with both the “Special One” and <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2022/10/25/michael-carrick-will-tap-expertise-sir-alex-ferguson-takes-first/\">his former manager at United, Sir Alex Ferguson</a>.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>He has, though, done things his way and it is his North East roots that have enabled him to grasp what Boro supporters wanted from him and their team.</p><p>He said: “For me to see and hear people talking about and looking forward to the game and, over a period of time, coming to support us and enjoying how we play, that's really rewarding. </p><p>“We have a chance to really achieve something, that is the carrot dangled in front of us. It's a real privilege to be in the position.\"</p><p>Perhaps Carrick’s wisest decision since he became manager was to appoint his former Tottenham team-mate, Jonathan Woodgate, as his assistant.</p><p>Woodgate had not only played for his home-town club, he had also been manager for two seasons. Yet, he was willing to drop his ego and go back to being a coach in order to help Carrick succeed. With another former Middlesbrough player, Grant Leadbitter, who was born and raised in Sunderland, alongside Geordie Carrick, it is a pan-North East coaching team.</p><p>“You have to understand what people are after,” Carrick explained. “What they want, what type of team they want to see, what type of feeling the supporters want from their club.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal\">‘You can't buy or fake the connection the club has with its fans’</h2><p>“It's important to have that connection. You can't buy that, you can't fake it. We have that connection here and it's a huge part of what we have done.</p><p>“You don't always get that as a manager, I know that. It has been massive for us.</p><p>“It's been great coming back to the North East. I've seen more of my parents in the last six months than I had done in the previous 20 years probably. It has been nice to be back with my family and then it's about coming into work here every day with good people. I knew straight away that I had made a good choice coming to Middlesbrough.”</p><p>Carrick reserves special praise for his assistant. “Woody has been crucial from the start,” he added. “It tells you about who he is and what he stands for, that he would come back here as a coach after being the manager.</p><p>“I knew he would give everything. He is from here and the club means a lot to him.</p><p>“I have relied on him a lot and leant on him a lot. I cannot praise him enough.”</p><p>As ever, Carrick does not want anyone to focus on him, but he is the reason Boro have this opportunity, even if he would rather not admit it. In time, other clubs may well be tempted to try to lure him away. Such talk gets short shrift from the man himself.</p><p>“These days time is something people haven’t got,” he replied, when asked if he was the next big thing in English management. “Everyone is desperate for the next thing, that instant whatever in life, be it a manager or the next thing online.</p><p>“It has to be quick and everything is so extreme. I am enjoying what I am doing, loving it here and trying to make the place as good as I can. I am learning and developing, and patience is a great thing if you can have it.”</p>\n",

Eurovision fever has duly gripped the nation, dominating the TV and radio schedules. Tuesday and Thursday’s semi-finals were broadcast on BBC One for the first time. A whopping 12 million UK viewers are expected to tune in for the grand final, joined by 160 million worldwide. That’s a lot of crisp crumbs on a lot of sofas.</p><p>With fans flocking to Merseyside, the city has been transformed. There’s a “EuroVillage” on the waterfront with food, drink and live music – like a mud-free Glastonbury. It will be rammed with 25,000 flag-waving, fancy-dressed fans come Saturday. Cultural highlights have so far included art exhibitions, an outdoor concert by English National Opera and a submarine parade through the streets. </p><p>The party atmosphere inside the M&amp;S Bank Arena was infectious during this week’s semis and should reach fever pitch for the main event. See it as a camper Coronation. Penny Mordaunt is presumably Pritt-Sticking sequins to her sword as we speak. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Will train strikes impact the event? </h2><p>Thousands of passengers travelling to Liverpool for the Eurovision final over the weekend will be impacted by upcoming train strikes. Aslef drivers will be staging a walk-out on Friday May 12 while RMT members will be striking on the day of the final (Saturday May 13).</p><p>Those travelling should plan their journeys in advance and check with their train operator on how to get around the strike. <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/10/train-strikes-may-june-2023-dates-aslef-rmt-rail-services-affected/\">Network Rail has provided advice</a> and has warned that its services will be busy throughout the week.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How can I watch? </h2><p>For the first time in the competition's history, the BBC is broadcasting both semi-finals as well as the Grand Final live on BBC One and BBC iPlayer. The first semi-final is available on iPlayer now.</p><p>The upcoming shows will also be available to watch on the Eurovision Song Contest YouTube channel.</p><p>For those watching from the US, Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir will be providing commentary on Peacock for all three shows from 3pm ET/ 12pm PT.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Which will be this year’s Spinal Tap? </h2><p>Novelty songs with bonkers staging are Eurovision’s speciality, so talking points should be plentiful. Austria’s unhinged dance duo Teya &amp; Salena claim their song Who the Hell is Edgar?, was written by the ghost of Edgar Allen Poe. Norway’s Alessandra is a goth Lady Gaga whose pyro-pop banger Queen of Kings “celebrates her life as a bisexual woman”.</p><p>Germany has gone for glam-metal and Moldova for Neolithic flutes with antler-clad dancers. </p><p>“Ones for the dads” include Israel’s Noa Kirel (a pocket rocket with powerful Beyoncé-style choreography), and Poland's Blanka (an ex-model surrounded by bendy dancers). Perhaps daftest of the lot are Croatia’s moustachioed military fetishwear and Finland’s green flouncy sleeves resembling a flamenco-dancing Incredible Hulk. Now there’s an image to conjure with.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How orange will host Hannah Waddingham be?</h2>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Very. Expect Strictly Come Dancing levels of spray tan. After her successful stint hosting the Olivier Awards in April, Ted Lasso star Hannah Waddingham is back to present Eurovision. The actress, who also recently starred in ITV's Tom Jones, impressed again at Tuesday's semi-final by speaking in French and showcasing her singing voice. Waddingham and co-presenters Alesha Dixon, and Julia Sanina – the frontwoman of Ukrainian rock band The HARDKISS – will return for Thursday's show. Eurovision veteran Graham Norton will join the hosting line-up for the Grand Final.</p><p>The comedian and chat show host, who <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/terry-wogan-fell-love-eurovision/\">took over from Terry Wogan as the UK's commentator</a> in 2008, will combine his usual duties with his new role as co-host. Norton will take turns in the commentary box with former Great British Bake-Off host Mel Giedroyc for the final.</p><p>Radio DJs Rylan and Scott Mills, who also have their fair share of experience covering Eurovision, will be bringing audiences analysis for the semi-finals.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Will President Zelensky turn up?</h2><p>Volodymyr Zelensky usually attends the opening of a manilla envelope to raise global support. The Ukrainian leader says he has “great respect” for the UK but <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/05/11/zelensky-eurovision-hosting-nation-uk/\">Slovakia or Poland would have been his preference to host</a>, so Ukrainians would find it easier to attend. But he won't be there, even by videolink, after Eurovision organisers decided an appearance would be <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/05/11/zelensky-eurovision-hosting-nation-uk/\">“against the rules”</a>. </p><p>Yet there will be a strong Ukrainian presence on stage. Co-presenter Sanina fronts Ukrainian alt-rock band The Hardkiss, while reigning champions Kalush Orchestra will open the show. There could also be a cameo from drag queen Verka Serduchka, a cult hero who finished runner-up in 2007 while dressed entirely in tin foil. Mmm, sweaty.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Will the UK come last again?</h2><p>The homegrown hopeful is Mae Muller, our first female entrant for five years, with sassily meta track <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/mae-muller-uk-eurovision-entry-wrote-song-review-precision-tooled/\">I Wrote a Song</a>. Embarrassingly, the UK has finished rock bottom five times in the past 20 years. However, spaceman Sam Ryder broke that poor run by finishing a plucky second last time – hence us being invited to host.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Can Muller go one better? </h2><p>Well, she was born in 1997, the same year that we last won with Katrina &amp; the Waves’ entry Love Shine a Light, which could be an omen. Just pray we don’t fall victim to “the curse of song two”. The second song performed at the final has never won. It’s the slot of death.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How does the voting work, exactly?</h2><p>It’s complicated. Until recently, voting comprised a mixture of tallies from the juries of individual countries with an element of public voting. However there has been a big shake-up to the voting system this year after irregular voting patterns were discovered among the juries of six countries during a semi-final last year. Essentially Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and San Marino were all suspected of voting for each other.</p><p>So this year, for the first time, juries from individual countries are banned from deciding which nations progress from the semis to the Grand Final. Rather, this is now be determined solely by a public vote, as happened last night (favourites Sweden and Finland got through, Ireland was knocked out). And for the first time too, viewers from countries not taking part (so-called Rest of World countries) are able to vote for their favourite songs (they’ll have to pay €0.99 per vote for the privilege). Readers may have noticed that UK audiences weren’t able to vote in Tuesday night’s semi. Why was this? It’s because the six countries with a bye to the final are only allowed to vote in one semi each. This was randomly allotted earlier this year – and the UK got Thursday’s semi-final.</p><p>But that’s just the semis. The rankings in the all-important Grand Final will still be decided by a combination of the points from countries’ individual juries (“douze points from Sarajevo” etc.) and votes from viewers. Each person can vote up to 20 times but will be unable to select their own country’s entry. However there is a tweak this year (are you keeping up?). Until now, votes in the final have been weighted 50-50 between juries and the public vote. </p><p>But votes from new Rest of World countries will now be combined to have the equivalent weight of one participating country. This will alter the 50-50 ratio to give the general public a 50.6 per cent say in the winner, versus a 49.4 per cent say for the juries. Which means that Eurovision has basically become a People’s Competition. Knotty isn’t it? And you thought it was just a cheesy singing competition. Of course, the new rules still won’t wipe out political voting: the juries from Greece and Cyprus will still probably give each other maximum points.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Will everyone still just vote for Ukraine? </h2><p>Quite likely. Blue-and-yellow flags are a common sight around Liverpool, while 3,000 tickets were made available to Ukrainians living in the UK. Opposition to the Russian invasion and support for citizens under fire are still riding high. The same sentiment helped propel Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra to victory last year with their defiant folk-rap song Stefania. </p><p>That aside, Ukraine has quickly established itself as a major Eurovision player. Since making its debut in 2003, it has won three times and been runner-up twice. </p><p>This year’s entrant, Heart of Steel by electro duo Tvorchi, looks likely to score highly. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Will countries still just vote for their neighbours? </h2><p>Hopefully less so than usual, due to pro-Ukrainian sentiment and a general sense of unity. However, geopolitics inevitably strays into the contest in the form of block voting. Watch out for the Slavic vote, the Nordic vote and the Francophone vote. Not forgetting Greece and Cyprus, which always award each other the maximum 12 points. Expect ironic cheers when they invariably do so. </p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Will Catherine Tate be funny?</h2><p>Among those who care about such fripperies, there was frenzied speculation about who would declare the results of the UK national jury. Would it be a Liverpudlian musician, such as Paul McCartney (dream on) or Mel C from the Spice Girls (much more plausible)? Or just a random celebrity, such as Nigella Lawson, Mel Giedroyc, Richard Osman or Lorraine Kelly in previous years?</p><p>It was announced on Wednesday that it would be Catherine Tate, best known for her sketch show and as Doctor Who companion Donna Noble. Will she do it in the guise of foul-mouthed Nan (“What a f---ing liberty!”) or surly schoolgirl Lauren (“Am I bovvered?”). Unlikely. Chances are that Tate will play it pretty straight with the odd witticism.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Do performers sing live?</h2><p>Yes, all lead vocals must be live. This includes any over-dubs by the singer that follow the song’s melody. Performers can choose between pre-recorded backing vocals, live backing singers (either on or off stage) or a combination of live and recorded backing vocals. Songs must be original compositions and no longer than three minutes long. No more than six performers are allowed on stage during any one song. </p><p>Pre-recorded backing tracks were first allowed in 1973 so long as all the instruments that were pre-recorded were also seen being “performed” – or mimed – on stage. This rule was made redundant by the dawn of electronic music and scrapped in 1997, the year after Gina G’s band had to cart massive computers onto the stage to perform Ooh Aah… Just A Little Bit because those were the instruments on which the song was partially created.</p>\n",

      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">How important is Eurovision to Europe?</h2><p>It’s an exercise in soft kitsch power, really. Although 160 million viewers around the world can’t be bad for Europe’s various tourist boards. The host cities benefit too. An estimated 100,000 extra people will visit Liverpool over this year’s Eurovision bringing in an estimated £250 million to the local economy. They’ve still had to pay for staging the event, mind (the Government has also chipped in £10 million and the BBC are expected to spend between £8 million and £17 million on broadcasting the event, a bit of which will come from that Government contribution).</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">I thought this was <em>Euro</em>vision. How come Australia and Azerbaijan can enter?</h2><p>Australians have always loved Eurovision. Despite being 7,000-odd miles away from Europe, the country was invited to perform during the interval of the competition’s semi-finals in 2014. The following year Australia was given a one-off chance to compete in the actual finals due to it being Eurovision’s fiftieth anniversary. Singer Guy Sebastian came fifth and so impressed the Eurovision hierarchy that Australia was allowed to return annually as a full-time competitor. If Australia wins the contest then it doesn’t mean that participants would jet off to Sydney for the following year’s bash. A special rule means that a victorious Australia would have to pick a European co-host to lay on the competition on its behalf.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>And Azerbaijan? Well, the “Euro” in Eurovision isn’t really geographical. Rather it stems from the fact that the contest is organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which comprises broadcasters from counties in Europe and beyond. According to the EBU’s website, it has 112 member organisations from 56 countries with an additional 30 associate members in Asia, Africa and elsewhere. Full-time members also include broadcasters from Jordan and Tunisia.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Why, then, isn’t the USA in Eurovision?</h2><p>Americans have historically viewed Eurovision as a quaint and eccentric curio. Things started to change in 2016 when some 50 million US households were able to watch it for the first time thanks to a deal between the EBU and Viacom. Then in 2020 the contest got the Will Ferrell treatment in the comedy film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga in which it was, largely, portrayed as a quaint and eccentric curio (although the film did receive an Oscar nomination for best original song). Last year, broadcaster NBC launched its own US-only version. The American Song Contest pitted 56 performers against each other: one from each of the US’s 50 states, one from the capital Washington DC, plus one from each of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, US Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands. Oklahoma won. The contest was not repeated in 2023.  Still, at least Americans can vote in the actual Eurovision now - through the official app or by visiting <a href=\"https://eurovision.tv/vote\">here</a>.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Is Russia banned for good?</h2><p>Russia was banned from Eurovision following its invasion of Ukraine last year. Organisers explained the expulsion by saying that the event should stand for “the basic and ultimate values of democracy”. Following the ban, Russia’s state broadcasters suspended their membership of the EBU, preventing them from taking part in future competitions too.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Who else isn’t appearing?</h2><p>They’re not banned, but Montenegro, North Macedonia and Bulgaria won’t be appearing at this year’s contest as they’ve said they can’t afford the registration fees. This fee was pushed up by Russia’s exit, meaning that other countries had to pay more.</p><h2 class=\"u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour\">Is Eurovision good for your career?</h2><p>It can be. ABBA (1974), Celine Dion (1988) and Olivia Newton-John (1974) went on to become global superstars after Eurovision. The contest has also helped sustain the careers of artists who’ve already made it, such as Michael Ball (1992), Cliff Richard (1968) and Lulu (1969). And it has given boosts to performers in the later stages of their careers (Katrina and the Waves, Engelbert Humperdinck and Bonnie Tyler). </p><p>Måneskin, the Italian winners from 2021, are now huge mainstream stars: they played London’s O2 this week, have supported the Rolling Stones and will play Glastonbury next month. Last year’s UK entrant Sam Ryder has done pretty well for himself too. But for every artist who makes it, dozens don’t. Four words: Scooch, Jemini, James Newman. </p><hr/><p>Did you know you can bet on Eurovision?

Sunderland would love him to come back, although United manager Erik ten Hag has made it clear he wants to take a closer look at the 20-year-old in pre-season.</p><p>In the big games, Diallo has delivered and his magnificent strike, just before halftime, helped Sunderland turn this game around after Luton - unbeaten in 14 games before this defeat - had taken an early lead.</p><p>This may only be at Championship level, but there is something exciting about the young Ivory Coast international and he deserves a chance to show what he can do at a higher level.</p><p>The same can be said about Sunderland. This young, swaggering side are the embodiment of the fearlessness of youth with their second goal scored by their 21-year-old defender Trai Hume, who got on the end of a delicious cross from their 22-year-old winger Jack Clarke.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Without a single specialist centre back available, Sunderland’s best form of defence was always going to be to attack and try to avoid giving away cheap corners and free kicks in and around their own box.</p><p>Sunderland played two wingers as wing backs, Clarke on the left and Patrick Roberts on the right. It was a do or die formation. It looked a little kamikaze but it was also incredibly exciting to watch. With the former West Ham Under-23 captain Pierre Ekwah a destructive presence in midfield, they only allowed Luton one chance from a set piece in the first half. Unfortunately the visitors scored from it.</p><p>Sunderland’s defence could not clear a corner. Luton won three headers inside the area and although Anthony Patterson made a superb save to deny Alfie Doughty, the ball fell kindly for Elijah Adebayo to sweep into the roof of the net.</p><p>Patterson was needed to make another save from a Doughty free kick but it was Sunderland who made the next set piece count.</p><p>It was a quite remarkable strike by Diallo, the ball swerving, dipping and curling as it flew into the top corner, beyond the goalkeeper’s dive. It was his 14th goal of a tremendous loan spell, a sensational strike and the easiest assist of Alex Pritchard’s career, who merely rolled a short free kick into his path.</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>The Black Cats had their tails up and a patient passing move almost created a second goal, as Pritchard picked out Gelhardt inside the area, but his first-time shot went the wrong side of the post.</p><p>Mowbray’s side finally took the lead with a brilliantly worked short corner routine, coming inside with the ball, before pushing it wide again to Clarke, who whipped in a wonderful cross from the young Northern Ireland international Hume to head home.</p><p>Signed from Linfield in January last year, he had only scored one goal this season before this, but took this chance like a seasoned centre</p><p>Given Sunderland have generally been better away from home this season they will be favourites to reach a second play off final at Wembley in as many years. Luton, though, know how to hurt them and will surely get far more balls into the box in the second leg then they did here.</p>\n",

      "<p>Whatever transpires with the ownership saga at Manchester United over the coming days and weeks, it is impossible to overstate the importance of a top-four finish this season.</p><p>Given the major surgery still required to this squad, Erik ten Hag has a tough enough job trying to determine where his limited funds should be best directed over the summer without the prospect of his transfer budget being severely hit by the denial of vital Champions League revenues.</p><p>This, then, was a crucial win in the grander scheme of things and means United can guarantee a top-four berth with two more victories, even if Liverpool win all of their remaining three matches.</p><p>After back-to-back defeats away <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/04/brighton-vs-man-united-live-score-premier-league-updates/\">to Brighton</a> and West Ham made that job harder than it really needed to be, there was little margin for error against Wolves but, for all the pleasure Ten Hag will have derived from the result, it was also a game that served only to highlight the pressing need for attacking reinforcements.</p><p>There are holes to plug all over this team but the absence of a top class centre-forward has felt more pronounced with every passing week and the fact it took an 18-year-old winger to show more seasoned players what composure in front of goal looks like told its own story here.</p><p>Alejandro Garnacho was the coolest man in the stadium when released by Bruno Fernandes in the fourth minute of stoppage time and never seemed like missing as he slipped a smart finish in off a post and beyond the impressive Wolves goalkeeper, Dan Bentley.</p><p>United fans had been calling for the Argentine’s introduction long before he was finally brought on with eight minutes to go and it was not hard to see why.</p><p>The contrast with Antony, Jadon Sancho and fellow substitute Wout Weghorst, all of whom had squandered opportunities to kill off a poor Wolves long before Garnacho put the result beyond any doubt, was stark.</p><p>“United never goes the easy way, it goes the difficult way,” Ten Hag said. “Once again we made their goalie man of the match. Against Brighton it was the case, today the case, in other games the case. We have to be more clinical and make it easier because the second goal closes the game. We have to improve on that fact, definitely.”</p><p>As much as United fans long for the Glazers to go - the prospect of the Americans staying on, even as minority shareholders, would go down badly with many - so Ten Hag is crying out for <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/04/24/man-utd-transfer-news-harry-kane-bid-tottenham-contract/\">a striker of Harry Kane’s quality.</a> Wolves were not good enough to punish United’s chronic wastefulness but other teams have been this season and, while the next few weeks are all about getting over the line, serious progress next term will be much harder to come by next term if Ten Hag’s side remain so profligate.</p><p>Bruno Fernandes has created almost as many “big chances” as Kevin De Bruyne this season but has eight fewer assists than the Manchester City midfielder, which reflects the ruthlessness of the Premier League leaders compared to United.</p><p>Having managed just three goals in their past six outings, it did not help that top scorer Marcus Rashford was missing with a leg injury. Ultimately, United passed what Ten Hag had described as a “test of courage” without the England striker but it should have been far more comfortable than it was. </p><p>Anthony Martial’s goal here was only his fifth in the league this term - a tap-in from Antony’s pass - and after eight seasons at Old Trafford no one at the club should need telling he is not the answer. With Antony, you felt he could have played all day and not scored.</p>\n",

      "<p>Only one of the Brazilian’s six chances hit the target, with Bentley forced into a good save late on, and the most glaring miss was a free header from inside the six-yard box in the first half when it seemed harder not to hit the target. Weghorst also missed a free header from six yards and Sancho had another of those afternoons when you wonder what kind of attacker he is supposed to be. It is certainly hard to see him getting in ahead of Garnacho next season with the pair appearing to be on opposite trajectories.</p><p>This was Garnacho’s first appearance for two months following an ankle injury and his return was warmly welcomed by fans who expect their attackers to play with a swagger and confidence that both excites and intimidates. Garnacho’s pace and movement brought an immediate uplift and his goal the biggest cheer of the day.</p><p>“One aspect of the biggest talents is they are mature, they take responsibility and they bring their skills, they can dominate opponents,” Ten Hag said. “He has a big impact in many games, whether he’s starting or coming on.”</p>\n",

      "<p>Mauricio Pochettino has agreed terms <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/04/24/next-chelsea-manager-mauricio-pochettino-set-to-named/\">to become the new Chelsea manager</a>, and will take over for pre-season this summer after what has been the club’s worst Premier League campaign in 20 years.</p><p>Telegraph Sport revealed the deal had been agreed just hours after interim manager Frank Lampard’s side failed to win <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/13/chelsea-vs-nottingham-forest-result-awoniyi-safety/\">at Stamford Bridge against Nottingham Forest</a>, the club with the worst away record in the Premier League.</p><p>The former Tottenham Hotspur manager was not at the game and is understood to be out of Britain currently. His family base remains in London although since he left Spurs in November 2019 he has managed in Paris and has a home in Barcelona where he spent much of his playing career.</p><p>The Argentine has taken his time agreeing terms with the consortium that owns Chelsea, led by private equity investors Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali. The club have spent around £600 million on players since the takeover 12 months ago during which time they have <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/04/02/how-chelseas-faith-in-graham-potter-slowly-ebbed-away/\">sacked Thomas Tuchel and Graham Potter</a>. It is expected that the club will have to invest in a new centre-forward and a new goalkeeper. Edouard Mendy came back into the side in place of Kepa Arrizabalaga, to face Forest, one of five changes.</p><p>Pochettino’s loyal staff of Jesus Perez, Miguel D'Agostino, Toni Jimenez and his son Sebastiano are all expected to join him at Chelsea.</p><p>Chelsea have three games left this season – away at Manchester City and Manchester United - and then back at Stamford Bridge for the final fixture against Newcastle United. Pochettino is not expected to be attending any of them and Lampard will remain in charge until the end of the season.</p><p>Pochettino has never been subject to an offer from Spurs to go back there. His former club <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/12/tottenham-next-manager-spurs-nagelsmann-pursuit-stalls/\">are also looking for a new manager</a>.</p><p>Lampard bemoaned his Chelsea team’s lack of a killer instinct against Forest. Under him Chelsea have now taken just four points from the six Premier League games for which he has been in charge, having taken a second half lead through Raheem Sterling’s two goals. There were also two for the Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi for an away team that took advantage of set-pieces and long throws.</p><p>There was a promising performance - after a nervous start - at left-back from the teenager Lewis Hall, signs that Lampard is trying to lay the foundations for his successor next season.</p><p>Lampard said that the team lacked the “killers” having failed to capitalise on a first half in which Chelsea dominated possession but finished one goal behind. “What I’m more disappointed about is that we lost 45 minutes in the game where we had all the control and we weren’t doing all the things that we talked about before the game.</p><p>“It’s not good to play at 60 or 70 per cent in the last third. The last third has to be at 100 per cent and not just be repetitive. That’s not something that can change overnight. It’s not the training at this point in the season that is going to change this season or what these games look like, it’s the idea, sticking with the idea and doing it, doing it and doing it.</p><p>“In the second half when we showed bits of that it looked different and it was a game you’d want to come and watch. You have to have speed in the last third of the game and at the moment we’re a little bit too comfortable getting up there and being slow, and it’s not enough to defend against. With big possession, we should have more shots, be more clinical, more killers, but that isn’t the case and that’s a process that will take time because it’s not changing right now.”</p><p>Asked what he expected over the next two weeks, Lampard said: “I want to see good play, some results [and] them [the players] competing, showing pride. The things you want to see all the time. That starts now for Manchester City and it has to go through the week.”</p>\n",

      "<p><strong>By Daniel Schofield, Deputy Rugby Correspondent, at StoneX Stadium</strong></p><p>Northampton knew they needed perfection and a whole heap of luck if they were going to squeeze past Saracens. Inside a minute of the Premiership semi-final at the StoneX Stadium, the Saints realised their prayers had not been answered. </p><p>Rather than the Gods, it was referee Karl Dickson who determined their fate. Northampton full back George Furbank leapt high to claim a booming clearance and was clattered in the air by wing Sean Maitland who was not looking at the ball. His elbow also appeared to make contact with the head of Furbank, who required lengthy attention.</p><p>The only debate appeared to be what colour card Dickson would administer. Had he decided it was a sending off then there is little chance the television match official would have found the mitigation to reduce that to yellow. Instead he seemed reluctant to award a penalty with the cards staying firmly in his pocket. </p><p>Perhaps he did not want to make such a big call so early in a big game but it was a curious decision from a curious appointment to the World Cup panel of referees.</p><p>Almost inevitably Maitland went on to score two tries in the first quarter to establish a lead that was only ever briefly threatened in the second half by a Saints side whose customary spark was extinguished by the fire blanket that is the Saracens’ all-consuming defence. They have now reached their seventh final in the past ten years.</p><p>To be fair, Northampton director of rugby Phil Dowson made little issue of Dickson’s decision. “The referee didn’t give it, a collision in the air,” Dowson said. “I presume the TMO looked at it and deemed it a rugby contest. I don’t know where Maitland was looking and where he was in conjunction to the ball in the air. You need to be lucky. A couple of things didn’t go our way and that was a decision that didn’t go our way, but it was still 15 v 15 and we conceded three tries in the first half. Against the best team in the league you are going to struggle, irrelevant of any decisions.”</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Even if they had been reduced to 14 men, you still fancy Saracens would have cantered to victory. Maitland grounded kicks from Alex Goode and Owen Farrell, who ran the show for Saracens in attack. The enterprising Ivan van Zyl added a third try in the first half when he caught Northampton’s defence unawares with a quick tap penalty. A snapshot of how much broader Saracens’ horizons are this season came in the second minute when Northampton turned the ball over deep inside the home 22. </p><p>Goode launched a counter attack with a long mispass behind his own tryline to Maitland who scorched past Courtney Lawes which took it all the way to the shadow of Saints’ posts. </p><p>Yet what has not changed about Saracens is the depth of their defensive desire. Northampton possess the league’s most incisive attack but they frequently found themselves running down blind alleys where Ben Earl and Maro Itoje were awaiting to mug their latest victim. </p><p>“I thought it was our strongest defensive performance for years,” Mark McCall, the Saracens director of rugby, said. “It’s always been the DNA of the club. That’s as good as we have been for a while and that laid the foundation for the victory and the performance. I thought we got control of a very good attacking team. They are the sort of team who if they get quick ball from the first couple of phases they are hard to handle, the best team in the league in fact. We held them early in the phases and we backed that up with some physical shots.”</p><p>Northampton did respond after a few pointed words from Dowson at halftime. They appeared to be going nowhere in particular inside the Saracens 22 until scrum half Alex Mitchell jinked sideways before accelerating past Jackson Wray and then sidestepping Van Zyl. England head coach Steve Borthwick may have taken note in the stands.</p><p>Wing James Ramm then finished an excellent team move down the right wing with Northampton at last playing with vibrancy and energy. That reduced the gap to nine points, but hope was immediately snuffed out as Saracens forced a turn over from kick off. </p><p>Dickson awarded a far less debatable penalty try and yellow card for Tom James’ side entry at a maul. With five minutes remaining, Owen Farrell and Elliot Daly combined sumptuously to give Max Malins a head start in a footrace that he was never going to lose.</p><p>With their attack firing and their defence as ferocious as ever, Saracens also do not look like losing, whomever they face in the final at Twickenham.</p>\n",

      "<p>Saracens host Northampton Saints this afternoon at the StoneX Stadium for a place in the Gallagher Premiership Final in two weeks. Saracens are looking to go one step better this season having lost in last season’s final to Leicester.</p><p>Saracens finished top of the pile in the regular season, finishing five points clear of Sale in second. The top seed has lost just one of the last seven semi-finals. They are unbeaten on home soil all season, having not lost at home since January 2022. However their only victory in their last four matches was their home win against London Irish in Round 23. They haven’t won consecutive matches since January, but they haven’t lost consecutive matches since January 2022. This afternoon’s semi-final will be their 14<sup>th</sup> in the Premiership and they are aiming to win their first title since the 2018-19 season. Saracens opted to rest most of their starts last weekend in the final game of the regular season away at Bath, perhaps mirroring the fact that Northampton had a rest last weekend due to it being their bye week.</p><p>Northampton took the final play-off spot, finishing fourth. They secured their place in the play-offs with a thumping win over Newcastle in the penultimate round of the regular season. They had a bye in the final week, meaning they have had three weeks off to prepare for today’s game. Despite reaching the semi-finals on 11 occasions they have only won twice. They have won just once away at Saracens in the Premiership since 2016, but they have won four and lost five at the StoneX Stadium. Northampton’s strength has been their attack scoring 620 points, the second most in the league only behind their opponents Saracens. However their defence has been frail to say the least having conceded 611 points, the second most in the league.</p><p>Saracens have won four of their last five matches against Northampton, losing the most recent meeting 38-29 at Franklin’s Gardens. However Saracens did rest a lot of key players for that game.</p><p>A place at Twickenham in two weeks time is at stake.</p>\n",

      "<p>This serves to make the actual chorus sound like a second chorus. The “Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-diy” singalong bit that follows arguably turns this into a three-chorus belter, with this last section tailor-made for video clips on TikTok, where Muller has over 550,000 followers. </p><p>The way the song builds is as hugely satisfying as it is clearly calculated ­– it sounds like Eurovision gold dust. There’s a flat-vowelled Lily Allen-esque rap towards the end to add some urban cool (Allen is Muller’s hero) before the song builds to one last drop and a final chorus. Cue confetti cannons and dancing in the aisles.</p><p>It’s canny lyrically: a revenge song about a cheating ex. Muller lists what she’d like to do to her former lover (“trash your Benz”) although at the 30-second mark she appears to be so livid that “I got some apples”. What she actually sings is “I got so mad was gonna cuss you out”, which is something of a relief as I had images of her poor ex being pelted with Granny Smiths. </p>\n",

      "<p>But Muller’s revenge fantasy takes a left turn when she settles for writing a song about the scallywag instead. That’s right, it’s a song about writing a song. This play-within-a-play metadrama is equally clever as it frees Muller from performing as a scorned lover and allows her – as per the song’s video – to perform a series of dance routines with a troupe in a variety of settings, another tick in the Eurovision box.</p><p>The song is perfectly calibrated. It combines the lemon-zing of revenge with a sprinkle of inner-city smarts, a dollop of campness and some club-ready beats. The song’s tongue grazes its cheek without overtly ramming itself into it. </p><p>I’d argue that TaP Music, who picked Muller as the UK’s entry, have taken a wise risk in going with an upbeat track rather than a ballad, as they did with <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/sam-ryder-outernet-review-eurovision-star-cant-quite-believe/\">Sam Ryder’s Space Man</a> last year. Due to the contest being held in Liverpool on behalf of war-torn Ukraine, I’d guess that plenty of entries this year will be sentimental ballads. For this reason I Wrote a Song will stand out. Just watch out for those flying teacakes.</p>\n",

      "<p>One more priceless lungful of air for Nottingham Forest in their quest for Premier League survival, and improbably achieved away from home where this was just the seventh point they have plundered all season.</p><p>Stamford Bridge is the kind of destination where a club fighting to stay in the Premier League might currently just believe they have a chance. It feels remarkable but such is the current gloom <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/03/another-month-of-frank-lampard-prolongs-chelsea-humiliation/\">that hangs over Chelsea in this benighted season</a>, Frank Lampard’s interim team for an interim regime might just prefer to be away from home. Even against Forest who came with a plan that worked.</p><p>Forest had just 24 per cent of the possession but what they had they used well. A five-man defence, and a midfield that did its best to support them with, much resting on <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/05/08/nottingham-forest-v-southampton-result-relegation-battle/\">what Taiwo Awoniyi might be able to rustle up</a> on his own up front. The answer was that he produced two goals, the second of which came when Chelsea had rallied to take the lead and looked like they might run away with it. These are the moments upon which seasons can turn.</p><p>Forest weaponised every dead-ball situation that they could – the “long, loopy throws” as Lampard described them as well as the corners and the free-kicks. They got the ball into the Chelsea penalty box early and you might say that Chelsea’s central defence did the rest. They were out-jumped the first time and slow to react on the second occasion. This is an anxious Chelsea team praying for the end of the season. They were booed off at half-time a goal down, and the home crowd just about suppressed the same instinct at the end.</p>\n",

Steve Cooper said that he had predicted a height advantage over Chelsea, in spite of the five changes Lampard made from the team that beat Bournemouth last weekend.</p><p>“We have scored three now from long throws and I am not giving a secret away from mentioning it,” Cooper said. “But it’s not about throwing it in there and seeing what happens, it is about the strategy around it.”</p><p>Forest and Chelsea both have owners who have spent fortunes assembling squads which can appear mystifying in their composition. Although it should be said that Forest have been dealing in a very different level of the market. Even so, in Morgan Gibbs-White they have a player whom Todd Boehly and the rest of the acquisitive Chelsea consortium would surely have noticed. Felipe led the defence confidently once again.</p><p>Asked whether that might be described as a “cracking result” Cooper demurred. “I wouldn’t say that – there are some disappointed guys in the dressing room and I like that. Although we had to work really hard for what we got today we could have easily got a little bit more. So it is a mixed feeling … we gave everything and stuck to the plan. We showed good resilience going 2-1 down. I wouldn’t say we gifted Chelsea but we could have done so much better.”</p>\n",

He is now part of a loose network of activists and enthusiasts battling to save Ukraine’s endemic species.</p>\n",

      "<p>“I divide my hobby into two parts. One is just to bring in new varieties and the other one is to find old varieties that are long, long forgotten or they are not found anywhere else,” he told The Telegraph.</p><p>Serhii said that, while he does earn “pocket money” by selling smuggled plants to collectors around the world, his primary motivation is now to preserve Ukraine’s native species for the next generation.</p><p>“The other thing is to rediscover old varieties. In Britain they’re going all over villages, old villages, and they try to get as much as they can, apples and so on,” he said. “There are a few programmes like that in the United States also. Here we can do the same thing.”</p><p>Serhii dreams of creating a seed bank to preserve Ukrainian species, but such a project would require significant government support.</p><p>Serhii recounted the discovery of a lost variety of pear growing in a village.</p><p>“Me and my brother were driving on the road and I spotted a pear tree – just the branches were hanging over a fence,” he said.</p><p>“We saw an old woman outside the house and we asked her about this variety, and she said we could take some prunings to test. She said her great grandfather planted the tree and [I’m thinking] this tree must be 80 or 100 years old.”</p>\n",

But apples, pears, any type of stone fruit – any peach,” he said.</p><p>Serhii now sees his work as a small act of saving Ukraine’s varieties. “When I send them to America or other countries in Europe, I think they’ll be in better hands. They’ll be saved over there. They’re going to find a new place, a new life.”</p><p>But Serhii’s smuggling operations are illegal, and he said the lack of any official support for his work cataloguing Ukraine’s rare fruiting trees makes it perilous – particularly in a time of war.</p><p>“Next to my orchard, about maybe a kilometre away, there was a Shahed that was shot down,” he said, referring to the Iranian-made kamikaze drones Russia uses to strike Ukraine. “My brother was in the orchard at the time and he saw how the drone got intercepted and how it burned on the ground. It was a big explosion.”</p>\n",

Rockets are hazardous to the environment: their fuel poisons the soil and water, causing chemical pollution of the environment,” he told The Telegraph.</p><p>“Landmine explosions lead to soil contamination with heavy metals such as lead, strontium, titanium, and others. This makes the soil dangerous and, in some cases, unsuitable for further agricultural use. It will take years to demine and restore these territories,” Mr Strilets said.</p><p>The Ukrainian government estimates 2,369 instances of damage to the environment so far, at an estimate of £42 billion, something that Mr Strilets said they aim to win back from the Russian Federation in international courts.</p><p>But, even after any potential end to the war, the impact on both the Ukrainian territories and those that try to live off it will last for many more years.</p><p>“I pray every day to God that we’re going to win this war as soon as possible,” said Serhii.</p>\n",

A man not dressed nearly enough (there’s a popular act, I’ll warn you now, who thinks he’s Ryan Gosling but is closer to Eric Pickles). An ethnic song that leaves you uncomfortable: the press release says it’s about a massacre, but we can’t work out if it’s pro or anti. An east European satirical song that is desperately unfunny.

A clothing disaster that either leaves a dancer liable to arrest for exposure or causes a small fire. Strobe lighting that induces a wave of epileptic fits across the country.</p><p>Finally, on the performance front, someone will go epically off-key. It always happens, and in case you missed it, listen out for Graham Norton describing the act as “brave.” That’s code for “terrible”. Production-wise, the hosts are British and Ukrainian, so expect jokes to fail in two languages. Anticipate video images of Britain that evoke the golden age of Bridgerton. </p><p>The best, ie most painful, bit will be the jury voting. San Thingummy's results will be read by a woman dressed as Joan Collins in 1984 (the president’s latest squeeze). A “comedian” from Scandinavia who, hilariously, says the 12 points go to him. A time-lapse delay of what feels like 30 minutes. And a results announcer who feels obliged to compliment every element of the production until the host, visibly losing their patience, mutters “hurry up” in French.</p><p>Back-stage, we shall see male models descending into a pool of womanly tears. And a woman who, at the beginning of the night, said “the important thing is taking part” will, if winning, be punching the air and shouting obscenities at the other acts.</p><p>Lastly, there WILL be politics. Oh yes. Take a shot of sherry every time someone says Slava Ukraini!, for this will be sweet Ukraine’s night and we all want to show our support.</p><p>Of course, there’s always a chance an idiot from Extinction Rebellion will glue themselves to Mr Norton – or a strike among militant make-up artists will bring the contest to a halt.

So a new cultural and political elite was beginning to emerge that no longer feels that it has to look to London.</p><p>However, this self-confident and nationally conscious India, whose prime minister is intent on returning historical artefacts, will have to consider how these plans are received in Britain.</p><p>The reception is likely to be mixed.  Certain institutions have said they are open to repatriation: the University of Oxford’s Ashmoelan <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/04/12/oxford-university-return-africa-benin-bronzes-pay-twice/\">has pledged to return its collection of Benin Bronzes to Nigeria</a>.</p><p>Tristram Hunt, the V&amp;A’s director, has voiced his support for repatriation in the past, but his insulation is bound by law to keep its collection intact.</p><p>The same applies for the British Museum, which has fended off repeated requests for the Elgin Marbles to be returned by referring the Greeks to the British Museum Act, which states that no objects can be handed over as they are, technically, held for the British people.</p>\n",

In February, growth was flat.</p><p>The March data lays bare the impact of successive public sector strikes.</p><p>Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said: \"Across the quarter as a whole growth was driven by IT and construction, partially offset by falls in health, education and public administration, with these sectors affected by strikes.\"</p><p>Without the impact of strikes, quarterly GDP growth in the first three months of the year would have been 0.2pc, the Bank said on Thursday.</p><p>Construction output rose by 0.7pc in the first three months of the year, which was the sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. </p><p>The growth from January to March was driven by repair and maintenance, which grew by 4.9pc.</p><p>It comes after the Bank of England improved its outlook for growth in the UK economy by a record amount on Thursday as it raised interest rates to their highest level since 2008.</p><p>The rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee forecast that the economy will be 2.25pc larger in three years time than it predicted in February – the biggest growth upgrade in its history.</p><p>The Bank predicted a 0.2pc expansion for the first and second quarters only six months after predicting that the economy would not grow at all in 2023.</p><p>It also revised up its full-year forecast for 2023 to 0.25pc growth, compared to a prediction of a contraction of 0.3pc back in February.  </p><p>The data showing a growth<strong> </strong>in the first quarter of 2023 comes after the UK economy narrowly avoided recession at the end of 2022.</p><p>The economy flatlined in the final three months of last year, having shrank by 0.3pc between July and September.</p>\n",

      "<p>Simon Thompson is set for a pay-off of up to £700,000 after quitting as the boss of Royal Mail in the wake of a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/10/royal-mail-trade-unions-pay-dispute-simon-thompson/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tempestuous battle with union leaders</a>.<br/><br/>Mr Thompson will formally step down from the helm of Royal Mail in autumn, leaving the UK postal monopoly on the hunt for its third chief executive in little more than two years.<br/><br/>His departure follows a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/03/29/unions-have-blame-royal-mail-driven-bankruptcy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bruising fight with the Communication Workers Union</a> (CWU) in a year-long row over pay and working conditions.<br/><br/>Mr Thompson, a former Apple and Ocado executive, was the focal point for union leader’s anger. Trade unionists personally attacked him over his handling of the industrial dispute.<br/><br/>His decision to step down comes just weeks after <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/04/21/postmen-royal-mail-10-per-cent-pay-increase-cwu-pressure/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Mail agreed a deal with the CWU</a> that brought to an end the worst campaign of industrial action since the company was privatised in 2013.<br/><br/>Mr Thompson said: “I have been incredibly proud to lead Royal Mail during this crucial period in its 507-year history. The changes we have made, the infrastructure we have put in place, and the agreements negotiated with our trade unions mean that Royal Mail now has a chance to compete and grow.<br/><br/>“That is what I have always wanted, and it is now the right time to hand over to a new CEO to deliver the next stage of the company’s reinvention. I would like to thank my team for their support during a difficult and important time of change.”<br/> <br/>Mr Thompson is entitled to a year’s salary, shares that have already vested, legal and “outplacement support” as well as a share of this fiscal year’s short-term bonus that could be worth as much as £90,000 if targets are hit. </p><p>The bonus would be paid at the board’s discretion, however.<br/><br/>Dave Ward, general secretary of the CWU, said: “[Mr Thompson] was also one of the key people responsible for the appalling mantra of “it’s our business to run” that saw the employer openly attack its own workforce on a relentless basis, including developing a culture of imposition which has now created quality of service… failures on a scale which threatens the future of the company.”</p>\n",
      "</div>, <div class=\"component article-body-text\" data-test=\"article-body-text\">\n",
      "<p>Mr Ward said more of the board of Royal Mail’s parent company International Distributions Services should now be considering their positions.<br/><br/>He said: “We recognise that the CEO was only one of the senior leadership team responsible for the unacceptable actions and behaviours of managers across the UK throughout this dispute. Further change in Royal Mail Group’s leadership team is vital.”</p><p>Royal Mail parent IDS said it was in “advanced stages” of appointing Mr Thompson’s replacement.<br/><br/>Keith Williams, the former British Airways boss and IDS chairman, will be under pressure to find the right person after losing two chief executives in comparatively short order. </p>\n",
