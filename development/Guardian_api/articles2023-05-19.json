North East Fife MP Wendy Chamberlain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leave bill will become law after it passed its final stage in the House of Lords on Friday, PA Media reported. It will take effect next year once it is given royal assent. An estimated 2.4 million unpaid carers across the UK will have a statutory right to take five days of unpaid leave a year from their paid jobs. The entitlement applies to all employees regardless of length of service and starting from day one of their employment. It also aims to minimise the pressure on employees who have to juggle work and caring. It has been described by charity Carers UK as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landmark\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd piece of legislation which would help unpaid carers balance their work and caring commitments. It is a topic Rishi Sunak would no doubt prefer to avoid: the record-breaking jump in net immigration \u00e2\u20ac\u201c soon to be revealed in official figures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is already causing increasingly fractious rows within his cabinet. Even a trip to the G7 summit in Japan was not far enough, with reporters on the flight asking directly whether the prime minister intended to stick to Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 manifesto pledge to bring net immigration down. Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response was, at best, evasive, and included the suggestion that he blamed the rise in foreign workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a leading factor in driving up figures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve inherited some numbers, I want to bring the numbers down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Pushed as to whether he stood by Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge, he refused to do so, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said I do want to bring legal migration down. I think illegal migration is undoubtedly the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priority, and you can see all the work I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m putting into that as well. But on legal migration as well we are committed to bringing those numbers down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His refusal to reiterate Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise has done little to calm a briefing war which has raged all week between members of Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet over whether the UK should issue more visas for foreign staff in industries short of workers. Peers have supported moves to give employees the right to request flexible working from their first day in a job, PA Media reports. The employment relations (flexible working) bill is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very welcome starting point and not an end point\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for reforming working conditions, according to Labour. The measures are supported by the government and received an unopposed second reading in the House of Lords. Under the current rules, a person who has 26 weeks of continuous service with their employer can request a change to their working hours, times or location. They are also required to explain the effect of the change on their employer and can only make one request in a 12-month period. The bill seeks to amend existing legislation to allow employees to make two requests a year, to no longer have to explain the impact on their employer and require consultation before an application is refused. Plans to shake up the railway network may be watered down, as legislation to give powers to a proposed new public sector body could be delayed, it has been reported. Great British Railways (GBR), announced in 2021 by the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, as a way to simplify the rail network and improve services for passengers, might not be brought forward in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s king\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech, the Times said, citing officials at the Department for Transport (DfT). The body was to absorb the state-owned infrastructure management company Network Rail and take on many functions from the DfT, with its tasks to include issuing passenger service contracts to private companies to run trains, PA Media reported. It was initially due to be launched in early 2024 but was delayed as the government axed its plan to introduce a transport bill during the current parliamentary session, citing the need to prioritise legislation related to the energy crisis. But the legislation required to set up the body may now also be excluded from the next parliamentary session, the last before a general election that the Conservatives may lose. According to the Times, DfT sources have been told the railways are not a priority for the prime minister, Rishi Sunak. They believe a significantly watered-down version of GBR could be established, without overall control of the railways, the newspaper said. The DfT sought to downplay the report, with a spokesperson saying: The government remains fully committed to reforming our railways and will introduce legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows, having already taken numerous steps towards reform. Rishi Sunak works \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly closely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the home secretary, Suella Braverman, on immigration policy, Downing Street has said. A No 10 spokesperson added that the prime minister would not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153put a number\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on his ambition to bring overall migration down but that he would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take stock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of official net migration figures due to be released later this month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[The prime minister] said specifically \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put a number on it.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what the numbers will be next week and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right we take stock of those,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Downing Street said, adding: But of course, the prime minister speaks to his cabinet colleagues and the home secretary specifically, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked incredibly closely on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcstop the boats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bill and the work the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking forward to try to tackle illegal immigration. Of course the prime minister will work closely with cabinet ministers on the ambition to reduce overall migration. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family photo time at the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, today. Here are the leaders, including Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rishi Sunak, at the Itsukushima shrine this morning. The BBC Board has commissioned a review of the broadcaster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coverage of migration, including small boats crossing the Channel, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consider whether due impartiality is being delivered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the corporation has said. The review would be jointly chaired by Madeleine Sumption, the director of the Migration Observatory based at Oxford University, and Samir Shah, the chief executive of the independent television and radio production company Juniper, PA Media reported. It will also assess the coverage of topics such as the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of sending migrants to Rwanda, the impact of migration on communities in the UK, and the admission of refugees from Ukraine. The BBC chair, Richard Sharp, said: Madeleine Sumption and Samir Shah are well-known for their expert understanding of the issues involved in delivering impartial coverage of migration, which is an important and often intensely contested subject. Their combination of evidence-based academic research and working knowledge of impartiality in broadcasting make them highly qualified to lead the thematic review into BBC migration output. Their findings will ensure the BBC continues to have the correct approach to producing coverage that audiences can trust. The review\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work would begin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the coming days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the broadcaster said, as it committed to publishing its findings. More than 200 BBC journalists in Northern Ireland are on a 24-hour strike to protest against cuts to jobs and programming. The National Union of Journalists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strike, which started at 00.15am on Friday, resulted in BBC Radio Ulster replacing its usual Friday fare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Good Morning Ulster, the Nolan Show, TalkBack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with content from Radio 5 Live. The station still broadcast hourly news bulletins. The action coincided with the counting of votes from the local government election held on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The decision to strike on such a significant news day has not been taken lightly and reflects frustration on the part of NUJ members,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the NUJ assistant general secretary Seamus Dooley. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They want to report the news rather than make their own headlines, it is regrettable that they find themselves in this situation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The BBC journalists are protesting against the axing of Radio Foyle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flagship two-hour morning show \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it has been replaced with a 30-minute news programme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a reorganisation of services in Northern Ireland which shifts funds to digital services. The corporation said it needed to make savings in some sectors while investing in online services. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s region-wide programming from Foyle has been increased and its net staffing levels will be maintained,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a spokesperson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our engagement with staff and the trade unions will continue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rishi Sunak has seen his personal family fortune fall by more than \u00c2\u00a3200m over the last year. Sunak, a former hedge fund manager and reputedly the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealthiest ever prime minister, and his heiress wife, Akshata Murty, have an estimated worth of about \u00c2\u00a3529m in the latest Sunday Times rich list, a fall from \u00c2\u00a3730m in 2022. Murty owns a small stake in Infosys, a $64bn (\u00c2\u00a352bn) Indian IT firm co-founded by her billionaire father. The value of that stake has fallen, driving the drop in the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes. Murty owns just under 1% of the business. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have lost about a fifth of their value in the last year as investors have worried about the future of the Indian technology sector. Rishi Sunak has talked up Ben Wallace in his effort to be the next Nato secretary general, after the defence secretary confirmed his interest in the job. The prime minister praised Wallace as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widely respected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd among his international counterparts when asked about his cabinet minister touting himself to succeed Jens Stoltenberg next year. Wallace has long been tipped as a contender owing to his role in supporting Ukraine after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion, despite the secretary general job often going to more senior politicians such as former prime ministers. The defence secretary has never previously said outright that he would like the job, but told the German news agency dpa on Thursday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always said it would be a good job. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a job I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also loving the job I do now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that secretary general of the transatlantic alliance \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is a fantastic job and Nato is an incredibly important part of all our securities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not for me to decide. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for all the other allies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning and welcome to the UK politics live blog. We start with news that Rishi Sunak has set a new goal of bringing migration down below the level he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inherited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which was about 500,000 net arrivals a year when he became prime minister. He redefined his target on immigration after earlier in the week backing away from the Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 2019 manifesto promise to reduce it below the level then of about 220,000. Sunak said he would not put a number on the level of net immigration he would like to see but he wanted it to come down below what it was when he took over. Figures released in November show net immigration was 500,000 for the year to June 2022. Experts believe net immigration figures for this year could come in at between 600,000 and 1 million, prompting a backlash among Conservative backbenchers. Speaking to broadcasters at the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, Sunak said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crystal clear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wanted to reduce immigration, but when pressed on how far, he said: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to put a precise figure on it but I do want to bring them down. He said: The numbers are too high and we want to bring them down. Now, the numbers last year were impacted by the fact that we welcomed Ukrainian refugees to the UK. Again, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something I think we are proud of. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is expected to join the summit in person as Sunak and allies seek to turn up the pressure on Russia. But more on that later."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/may/19/surrey-v-kent-notts-v-essex-and-more-county-cricket-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Surrey v Kent, Middlesex v Somerset, and more: county cricket \u00e2\u20ac\u201c live", "lead": "Join Tanya Aldred for updates from around the county grounds on the second day of the latest round of matches", "author": "Tanya Aldred", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T14:05:24Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035733", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d95ccc3c98f50c8afb37f8dfd01d9e8c0d971c82/0_253_3792_2275/500.jpg", "body": "At The Oval, Joey Evison spoils the Arafat Bhuiyan four-wicket run, as Jordan Clark falls for eight.

He shuffles to off, is hit midway down the pad, and turns in disbelief as the umpire sends him on his way. James Harris, what a scalp. Sussex 274-5 Round the grounds in Division Two: At Hove, Sussex are making hay. Fresh-faced James Coles, with 78, has his highest first-class score. He was Sussex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youngest debutant during the 2020 Bob Willis Trophy, aged just 16. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also played England U-19 cricket.

Now Piedmont is well and truly drenched and just a couple of hundred of kms to the South it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disaster.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the subject of rain do you think the draw points system might be unfair on counties which have a wetter climate? For example Lancashire and Somerset? And please could you explain the dynamics of Somerset\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non declaration?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was a messy business last Sunday. It seems the two sides couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on setting a target for Lancashire to chase, so Somerset just batted on. The thing I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite understand is why Somerset didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just set their own target, as difficult as they wanted, and leave it up to Lancashire to chase, or not. Glamorgan let Smith slip through their fingers! Smith edges Michael Neser, but first slip Timm van der Gugten can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold on. Meanwhile ,19 year old James Coles gloriously strokes Neser through the covers for four. All this is happening to the excited chatter of a thousand school children let into Hove today. At his playground, The Oval, Ollie Pope passes 4,000 first-class runs for Surrey, in the same week he is announced official England Test vice-captain. If the suspicions are true that Ben Stokes won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play in the Ireland Test, Pope will become the 82nd man to captain England in Tests. At Trent Bridge, Notts are getting off to a flier, as Ben Slater pulls the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third ball for six, Has strokes four, and so it continues. And the wicket deluge continues at New Road, nightwatchman Josh Davey caught at slip. Leicestershire, 75-3. No delayed starts, and off we go!

A lovely obituary of a cricket lover by his son, Simon. Rest in peace Mike Rines. Ollie Robinson squeezed the Ashes klaxon, trapping Marnus Labuschagne for just one at Hove. He was one of four wickets for Robinson as Glamorgan disintegrated for 123. But there were more treats in store for those who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d made the trip to the south coast. Shortly before half past six, Labuschagne pulled at the cuffs of his shirt sleeves and sent down two overs of his legspin at Steve Smith. His Australia teammate was not tempted, and moved with characteristic twitch and scratch to an unbeaten 68. Smith also watched with interest as Michael Neser, vying for a late baggy green call-up, dismissed Cheteshwar Pujara for his first Sussex duck. Six Test bowlers were dotted across the scorecards at Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, where Middlesex spent the day chasing the ball. Two early wickets had left Somerset vulnerable, but George Bartlett bounced to his first century of the year, and Tom Abell 77, as they put on a brisk third wicket partnership of 183. Tom Kohler-Cadmore, advertising his best Bazball credentials, got off the mark with a six into the pavilion and added 68 in 60 balls. Hampshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Vince tucked his napkin in and got stuck into the Northamptonshire bowling, as he had at Wantage Road last month. This time he got within a contented belch of his hundred, before being caught after propping forward to Rob Keogh for 95. Around him, Liam Dawson made an unbeaten 55 and there were forties from Fletcha Middleton and Ben Brown. On a flat Bristol pitch, Graham Clark made his first hundred for six years as Durham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s batting express steamed onwards against Gloucestershire, knocking up almost 400 runs in a day. There were four wickets for Zafar Gohar. Twenty-two wickets fell at New Road on a day of swinging balls, unpredictable bounce and nervous batting. First Leicestershire were bowled out for 173; held together only by a late-order 30 by Chris Wright and a fifty from Colin Ackermann. Wright, warmed up, then filleted Worcestershire with five wickets for a sneeze, as they were bowled out for 83. Kent made Surrey sweat over their last wicket at The Oval, as Joey Evison and Michael Hogan added 82 in 14 overs and even collected a batting point. Unexpected riches from an unpromising 118-7. At Trent Bridge, Alastair Cook knocked up 72 in Essex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 298, with three wickets for Nottinghamshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stuart Broad. Three South Asian Cricket Academy graduates made their Championship debuts on Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Zaman Akhter (Gloucestershire), Arafat Bhuiyan (Kent) and Zain Ul-Hassan (Glamorgan).

The forecast is for cloud and rain, sometimes heavy, but the expectations are heavier. It was a busy Thursday, in which 22 wickets fell at New Road, Durham sped along in what has become the expected way, Kent made Surrey sweat, a little, Sir Alastair kept Essex in the game at Trent Bridge, Somerset made the most of Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and James Vince\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hampshire got on top of Northants.

A transcription error from PA Media meant that, after an interview with the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris Mason, he was wrongly accused of saying Birmingham were promoted this season. He actually said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Burnley\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, who were of course the winner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s of this season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Championship, as a video of the interview proves. And to be fair, he stayed till the end last week when Southampton were relegated. World football news: this seems significant in geopolitical terms. Caf had been due to launch the 24-team tournament that has been heavily supported by the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, in August as part of plans to raise the global profile of African clubs and generate increased revenue. The Super League, first mooted by Infantino in 2018 and announced by Caf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Patrice Motsepe, in October, is planned to have prize fund of $100m that includes $11.6m for the winner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c almost $8m more than currently on offer for the winners of the African Champions League \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a solidarity fund that bring each of the 54 Caf member associations $1m a year towards football development. Liverpool v Aston Villa: Anfield will wave off four players on Saturday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita, James Milner and Bobby Firmino and J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Klopp has paid tribute: This game will be super difficult for different reasons. We spoke already with the boys; it is super important but also super emotional. We are saying goodbye to, from my point of view, four Liverpool legends. Two of them were here when I arrived, Milly and Bobby, and all the good things that have happened wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have without them. Ox came in, then Naby. Ox was unlucky in moments, bad injuries at bad moments, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fantastic guy. When people think about Naby, [he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had] a few too many injuries, but he played and performed well in some important games. We love them but it is professional football; nothing is forever. Jacob Steinberg has gone *there*, questioning the future of David Moyes, just when West Ham have reached a European final. This is history in the making. There is an argument that Moyes should leave on a high if he wins, cementing his status as a club legend. But would he want to walk away and would West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest shareholder, David Sullivan, be brave enough to push for change? Broadcast News: Jake Humphrey has announced he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stepping back\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from BT. BT Sports will become TNT this summer, now that Discovery have made a heavy investment into merging BT, with new offices, and what the viewer will be presented with next season remains opaque, despite BT currently training TNT. One thing now certain is that Humphrey will not be part of the team. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good news for fans of his High Performance podcast. Politics corner: Rishi Sunak has done a David Cameron Villa/Hammers mixup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well, almost. Having been present when his beloved Southampton were relegated last week, the prime minister decided to keep up the footy vibe in chatting to the BBC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a sad moment but I was pleased I could be there, actually, and be there with the fans and my family were there as well with their season tickets, quite near where I was sitting,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was nice to be back home to my football team I have supported since I was a kid and, hopefully, we can bounce straight back up as Birmingham and Sheffield United have in reasonably short order.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Birmingham, of course, finished 17th, the Blues stuck in the Championship for the last 12 seasons. Who Rishi meant was Burnley, Big Vinny Kompany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flashing blades. Oh well. Chris Rea fan Michael Butler has been looking into whether clubs turn it in at the end of a season. There can, however, be external factors. At this stage of the season, teams can easily be weakened by injuries or managers choosing to rest players for a cup tie. Often at this stage a few players are worried about picking up a knock before a European Championship or World Cup. Lots of things can affect a player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment, but it is a more random, sporadic set of reasons than a broad trend of players not trying. Good afternoon London time, and we build up to the weekend. Anyone else get the feeling Manchester City will be popping the corks on Saturday rather than Sunday evening? Handover time: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from me but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll leave you in the very capable hands of John Brewin. Have a great weekend, wherever you might be. Brentford: Thomas Frank has been holding court and the first order of business at his press conference was, predictably enough, his reaction to the eight-month ban handed down to Ivan Toney on Wednesday as punishment for multiple breaches of betting regulations. The 27-year-old will not be allowed to play again until 17 January and cannot even train with his team-mates until mid-September. Many commentators have said the punishment is excessive and smacks of double standards from a Football Association whose sport is inextricably linked with the gambling industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in contact with him,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Frank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointed and sad about the situation. His future is with Brentford, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt about that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Upon being asked if Toney is even allowed to set foot on Brentford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s training ground during the first four months of his ban, the Brentford manager said he isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We actually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are waiting for the information to see what we can do and what he is allowed to do for the first four months. We will do everything we can to be there for him, support him and be aware of the mental health of it. Of course he has made some mistakes. When you are waiting for what the sanction is going to be, the uncertainty is probably the worst thing. At least now he knows what it means.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bournemouth v Manchester United: Fighting to keep fourth spot in the Premier League with Liverpool breathing down their necks, Manchester United travel to Bournemouth tomorrow but could be without Marcus Rashford for the second game in succession. The England striker, who has scored 32 goals for club and country this season, missed last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win over Wolves through injury and after training all week in preparation for the Bournemouth game, is now reported to be feeling unwell. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rashy trained well the whole week but today he reported he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel well, so he is ill,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erik Ten Hag. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to see how he recovers during the day and then see tomorrow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd United go into the game with a one-point advantage over Liverpool and a game in hand but can ill afford any more slip-ups after recent defeats at Brighton and West Ham. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I see this project, first of all it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to get in the Champions League,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ten Hag. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think today at that standard, I look to the next game, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bournemouth. We have to win that game to get in the Champions League. We have everything in our hands so focus on the game, the games coming up, the first game is the most important.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scott McTominay is expected to be available to face Bournemouth but on-loan midfielder Marcel Sabitzer will miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. Asked whether the Bayern Munich player could have a future at Old Trafford, Ten Hag said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will see. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not our main focus, the main focus is Bournemouth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newcastle United: Following last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win over Brighton, Newcastle need just one win from their remaining two games to secure Champions League qualification for the first time in 21 years. Despite having spent \u00c2\u00a3250m on strengthening his squad since the club was taken over by Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Public Investment Fund, Eddie Howe has acknowledged that he will need to get plenty of new bodies in ahead of next season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European adventures. In the unlikely event Newcastle drop out of the top four, they will still be competing in the Europa League. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you have a strong squad, rotation will be important,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rotation is going to be important, utilising the whole squad is going to be important. We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t felt the necessity to necessarily do that on a consistent basis because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in one competition - of course, we had the cup run. We have rotated to a degree, but maybe not in the numbers that we might need to next year. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to do that, then the squad needs to be strong enough, so if you put out two XIs, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re of equal strength.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newcastle host a beleaguered Leicester side who are desperate for points on Monday night but will be without Joe Willock, who limpedd off last night with what is presumed to be a season-ending hamstring injury. Sean Longstaff and Jacob Murphy are also likely to miss out, while Bruno Guimaraes is playing through the pain while struggling with an ongoing ankle issue. Howe also said that Joelinton is suffering from extreme fatigue after the Brazilian \u00e2\u20ac\u0153succumbed to that brick wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which he runs through in each game he plays. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seemed to hurt him but we hope he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Mikel Arteta has said discussions over the future of Granit Xhaka will wait until the end of the season. The Swiss international midfielder is approaching the final 12 months of his deal at the Emirates Stadium and Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen are interested in signing him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The clarity is there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Arteta. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is a player that has played I think every minute since I have been the manager. He is an incredibly respected figure at the club. He has a great story around him with what he has achieved at the club in going through very tough moments and he is a key and very important part of us. Whatever happens is something we will discuss, certainly not now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Xhaka has endured a largely successful career at Arsenal since signing for the club from Borussia M\u00c3\u00b6nchengladbach in 2016 but was stripped of the club captaincy and looked to have burnt his bridges with Gooners after gesturing angrily at them, mouthing obscenities and discarding his shirt after they cheered his substitution during a match against Crystal Palace in 2019. Despite occasional bouts of hot-headedness, he has since achieved the near impossible by firmly re-establishing himself as a fan favourite at the club. West Ham v Leeds United: Sam Allardyce\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soliloquy on the subject of AI [mentioned below] came on the back of a question he fielded about the torrents of abuse directed at Patrick Bamford by some Leeds fans on social media after the striker missed a penalty against Newcastle last weekend. Bamford and his family were subjected to online threats by keyboard warriors and his manager feels more should be done to protect footballers from such toxic and potentially intimidating bile. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been OK,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said of Bamford. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously extremely upset about the situation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left a very, very bad taste indeed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like the police to do a lot more, but it appears with social media they rule the world and can say and do what they want unfortunately, which is why the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in such a big mess, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handled it pretty well. I think the club gave him as much support as he needed, particularly security-wise. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just about him, it was about his family. The best way for him to respond is to go out on Sunday, play to his highest level and try and score. It would be great if he scored the winner. Hopefully it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t affect his performance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wolves v Everton: Deep in the relegation doo-doo along with Leeds, Leicester and Nottingham Forest, Everton travel to Molineux tomorrow and ahead of this crunch encounter Sean Dyche has been telling reporters what he does and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stare at. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stare at the league table,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I stare at the performances, I stare at the group, I stare at the prep, I stare at the strategy, I stare at all these things, the tactics, these are the things I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m obsessing with. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course we all debate it and look at it during a season, of course we do, but the one at the end of the season, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the most important, the one we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking to be above the line on. I think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just stayed very clear-minded, trying to take away the layers of noise around our group to make sure we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focused on the game. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all we look to do, others can do however they wish.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd West Ham v Leeds: Addressing far more frivolous matters, Big Sam turned his attention to the game and said he hoped West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win over AZ Alkmaar last night might benefit his team as David Moyes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 players may be focussed on their Europa Conference League final against Fiorentina and subconsciously trying to avoid picking up injuries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My job is about getting my team playing as well as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can normally guess the team that is going to be picked but it is very difficult to look at this one. [David Moyes] made nine changes when they played Brentford last week, and of course our preparation is to try to predict a team, work out how West Ham play and do a little bit of practice against that, both offensively and defensively. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He might change the team but he will probably play the same way. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pleased for him [reaching a European final]; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known him many years. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had a fantastic career. Hopefully when we are having a drink afterwards, it is us who have the three points, not him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd West Ham v Leeds United: With Leeds battling against relegation and Sam Allardyce taking his side to his former stomping ground of West Ham, the big man has been offering his thoughts on exactly what you might expect ahead of the big game: artificial intelligence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I fear for our lives, as an old timer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, channeling his inner Abraham Simpson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AI (artificial intelligence). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just heard about 40,000 jobs going at BT, what are they going to do? The next piece of AI comes in, another 30,000 jobs go, what are they going to do? For me, it is not a great future, the way we are looking at the world and what we are doing with climate change. I worry for my grandchildren.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And so say all of us, Sam. The club have issued a statement confirming that the 31-year-old defender will leave Old Trafford when his current contract expires at the end of June. Signed from Blackburn in 2011, Jones enjoyed a good start to his Manchester United career, winning the title in his first season with Sir Alex Ferguson making the bold and arguably unhelpful claim that Jones \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could be our best player ever\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, a relentless catalogue of injuries derailed Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 career and he has barely played in recent years. Capped 27 times by England, Jones leaves United having made 229 appearances for the club, scoring six goals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been very difficult, the last couple of years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jones in an interview with the United media team. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no denying that. There is no hiding away from that. My family have been absolutely instrumental in keeping me on the straight and narrow and keeping me focused, to try to get fit and try to play more. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And, you know, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed playing football. I missed it. You grow up playing football and all you want to do is play football. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known, from such a young age, is to do what you love doing for a living. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been fortunate enough to do that, albeit not as much as I would have liked.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd United added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our No4 is now taking some time before deciding his next move and everybody at United would like to wish Phil the very best of luck for the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Europa Conference League: West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joy in reaching the final of the Europa Conference League was marred by supporters of AZ Alkmaar confronting friends and family of the visiting players after the final whistle at the AFAS Stadion, writes Jacob Steinberg. Pascal Jansen, AZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager, apologised for the trouble. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel ashamed it happened in our stadium. It should not be happening. You have to stay in control of your emotions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Read on \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Manchester City will be confirmed as champions for the fifth time in six year with a victory over Chelsea in front of their own fans on Sunday but will not even need a result should Nottingham Forest beat Arsenal tomorrow afternoon. Liverpool host Villa as they attempt to keep the pressure on Manchester United and Newcastle in the race for a top four finish, while Unai Emery\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s men have European aspirations of their own. Duking it out to qualify for the Europa League, Villa are breathing down the necks of a Tottenham side who host Brentford and Brighton, who host already relegated Southampton. In the fight against the drop, Forest entertain Arsenal, while Everton travel to Wolves and Leeds are hosted by a West Ham side that might still need a point to guarantee survival. And for the third time in three weeks, Leicester have to wait until Monday night to rage against the dying of the light. An unenviable trip to St James\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Park is next on their itinerary Premier League fixtures Tottenham Hotspur v Brentford (Sat 12.30pm BST) Liverpool v Aston Villa (3pm) Wolves v Everton (3pm) Bournemouth v Manchester United (3pm) Fulham v Crystal Palace (3pm) Nottingham Forest v Arsenal (5.30pm) West Ham v Leeds United (Sunday 1.30pm) Brighton v Southampton (2pm) Manchester City v Chelsea (4pm) Newcastle United v Leicester City (Mon 8pm) View the Premier League table It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the morning after the night before and leading into yet another big weekend. And what a night it was, eh? In the Premier League, Newcastle United put a recent wobble behind them to boost their hopes of a top four finish by emphatically beating Brighton at St James\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Park. One win from their final two games will guarantee the Mags their first taste of Champions League group action for 21 years. On any other Thursday evening, West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win over AZ Alkmaar in the Europa Conference League to book their place in their first European cup final in 47 years would almost certainly guarantee top billing but at Hillsborough, Sheffield Wednesday had other ideas and yelled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hold our beer!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and rolled up their sleeves. With angry calls for his head still ringing in his ears after last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s League One playoff semi-final first leg humiliation at the hands of Peterborough United, Darren Moore somehow rallied his troops to pull off an astonishing comeback by overturning a four-goal deficit to qualify for the Wembley final. A 5-1 win after extra time in a terrific game took the tie to penalties and Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nerveless players scored all five of theirs to miraculously advance. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a hard to act to follow but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty of weekend action ahead in which various teams can try and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be previewing plenty of it throughout the day."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/may/19/strawberry-and-custard-tart-recipe-ravneet-gill", "primaryCategory": "food", "title": "Ravneet Gill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recipe for strawberry and custard tart | The sweet spot", "lead": "Sweet and creamy, but balanced by bright strawberries, this tart will grace any summer table", "author": "Ravneet Gill", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T14:00:29Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035740", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cd7e69e7551bda560a8922ad1aed3466880ec01a/0_379_4333_2600/500.jpg", "body": "The combination of smooth custard and juicy, bright strawberries is a match made in heaven.

Strawberry and custard tart Prep 30 min Chill 30 min Cook 1 hr 20 min Makes 1 x 8-inch/23cm tart 230g strawberries, hulled and quartered 100g apricot jam \u00c2\u00bd lemon, juiced For the pastry 110g cold unsalted butter, diced 175g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 50g icing sugar A pinch of salt 3 medium egg yolks, beaten 100g strawberry jam For the creme patissiere 500ml full-fat milk 130g golden caster sugar \u00c2\u00bc tsp vanilla bean paste 35g cornflour 125g egg yolks (from about 6 eggs) 300ml double cream, lightly whipped to soft peaks Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. For the pastry, put the butter, flour, icing sugar and salt in a medium bowl and mix with your hands until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the consistency of breadcrumbs. Add two of the egg yolks and knead until it forms a smooth dough (do not overwork as you want it to be nice and crisp once cooked). Wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface to 5mm thick and use to line an 8-inch/23cm tart tin, leaving a little overhang (the pastry can shrink a little while baking). Add some baking beans and blind bake for 30-35 minutes, until the edges are golden. Remove the baking beans and cook for a further five to 10 minutes, until golden and cooked through. Brush the pastry with egg wash, and cook for two minutes more. Mix 20ml water with the strawberry jam and brush all over the entire pastry case. Carefully trim the excess pastry. For the creme patissiere, heat the milk with half the sugar and the vanilla in a medium saucepan, and bring to steaming point (just before it boils). In a large bowl, whisk the remaining sugar, cornflour and egg yolks. Gradually whisk the milk mix into the egg mix until well combined, then pour back into the pan and cook on a medium heat, whisking constantly, for a few minutes, until bubbling and thick. Blitz the creme patissiere mix in a blender to remove any lumps, then pour into a tray, place clingfilm on the surface to stop it forming a skin, and leave to cool. Once cool, put the creme patissiere in a large bowl and beat with a wooden spoon to loosen. Carefully fold through the whipped cream until combined.

His odds will have lengthened considerably after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 74, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fixing a lot of the damage today, starting out with birdies at 10, 12 and now 14. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back to +1, while Xander Schauffele\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similar (and aforementioned) tournament trajectory continues apace: birdie at 15 to follow his earlier one at 13, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level par, just four off the lead. A reminder that he was four over after the first three holes yesterday. Could a similar narrative to Jon Rahm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening four-putt double at the Masters be developing? Another birdie for Adam Scott! He clips his tee shot pin high to eight feet, and in goes the putt. His playing partner Max Homa pops one in too, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his fourth in five holes. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re -3 and -2 respectively. Scott sits alongside Michael Block, who birdies 1, and Justin Rose, who rakes in a long one across 12. It, to borrow a quote from Billy Liar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite comic Danny Boon, is all happening. -4: DeChambeau -3: Block (10*), Scott (6*), D Johnson (5*), Rose (3*), Conners, Scheffler Eric Cole continues where he left off earlier this morning: heading in the wrong direction. An opening bogey at 1 and the overnight leader drops to -2. Problems also for Thomas Pieters, who bogeys 6 and 7 to undo all of his good work today. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back where he started at -1. Bounce-back birdies at 14 for Adam Scott (-2) and Max Homa (-1). Then coming behind, Tyrrell Hatton, who is doing a decent job of repairing some of the damage from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 77. Having opened with birdie at 10, he makes a second of the day here, albeit in unconventional fashion: his wedge in spins back into the thick fringe, but then he bumps and releases from 30 feet straight into the cup. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +5. Par for DJ. The wind has picked up. So much so that DJ, who can usually reach the bunkers in front of the short par-four 14th with ease, ends up 60 yards short of them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s swirling as well. So what will be going through Tom Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind as he tees it up on 6, where yesterday he ended up covered cap to boots in mud? Especially as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decked head to toe today in pristine white duds?! Serenity, is what. He lashes it down the middle and saunters off insouciantly. He is however currently +5, a couple outside the current projected cut of +3 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the mood music suggests that cut will move out by at least a couple of shots, maybe even three or four, as the wind does its thing. Dustin Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had an unfortunate start. Three straight pars, but a lip-out for birdie at 10 and a shave of the left-hand edge from 25 feet at 12. Somewhere in the multiverse, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a couple of birdies to his name already today. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep on keepin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -3. Meanwhile Xander Schauffele tickles in a downhill 12-footer for birdie at 13, and the major-championship nearly man rises to +1. Had he not started bogey/double/bogey yesterday, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be one off the lead. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still very much in it. Yep, bogeys as expected for Adam Scott and Max Homa on 13. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back to -1 and level par respectively. An opening birdie for Justin Rose at 10; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -2. Meanwhile it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a typically spectacular start to the day for Phil Mickelson. A drive as wide left as it was long on 10 leading to a bogey; a chip flown over the green at 12 that somehow span back from out of the thick rough to eight feet, from where he makes birdie. The great man remains at +3 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just above the current projected cut line, for what that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth right now. Scott takes his medicine and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try to get too cute with his chip. In thick rough and with a severe downhill lie, he aims for the heart of the green rather than the closer flagstick. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be left with a 25-footer to salvage his par. Homa has a bit more green to play with, and a less severe lie, and chips out to 12 feet. Both about the best they could do. Both will most likely drop a a stroke. Block meanwhile can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make his 35-footer on 17 and drops back to -2. A couple of big tests coming up for Adam Scott (-2) and Max Homa (-1) on the monster par-five 13th. Scott sends a dreadful approach up a grassy bank to the right of the green, while Homa flies the dancefloor and ends up in cabbage behind it. The best of luck \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 which we also extend to club pro Michael Block, whose second into 17 ends up in the filth down the right of the hole. He manages to muscle his third onto the front of the green, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to make a long putt to keep his card clean. A backwards step for Hayden Buckley at 16, where a weak chip up costs him a shot. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only made one par today, at his opening hole, the 10th. Adam Scott meanwhile has opened with three pars, at 10, 11 and 12, though he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s come close with a couple of birdie efforts. Perhaps wisely not pushing too hard to repair the painful damage of that closing double bogey last night, rushing to finish as the sun went down. The 2013 Masters champion remains at -2 overall. Thomas Pieters joins the group in a tie for second. He finds the long par-five 4th in two big booms, only to leave a long eagle putt a worrying five feet short. But he knocks in the birdie effort and moves to -3. Meanwhile back-to-back birdies for Max Homa at 11 and 12, and one of the pre-tournament hipsters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 choices moves into red figures at -1. Less than an hour into the second round, and things are bubbling up nicely already. Hayden Buckley has only played in one major championship before. The 27-year-old from Chattanooga, Tennessee did pretty well in it: a tie for 14th at last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US Open. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had a couple of fine recent finishes too: a top-ten finish at the Texas Open and a tie for fifth at the RBC Heritage. He appears to be taking that good form into the PGA. A 69 yesterday, and after a slow start today with bogeys at 11 and 12, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responded with three straight birdies between 13 and 15. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -2 overall. The Michael Block party continues. One of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPGA Team of 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 club professionals in the field this week, the 46-year-old is taming the Oak Hill tiger right now. He calmly bangs his tee shot at the short par-four 14th down the middle, chips to eight feet, and tidies up for his third birdie of the morning. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shot off the lead! Meanwhile opening par for DJ, whose 12-foot birdie putt on 10 lips out on the right. So close to a share. -4: DeChambeau -3: Block (5*), D Johnson (1*), Cole, Conners, Scheffler -2: Davis (6*), Pieters (3), Mitchell (3), Bradley, Hovland, Fox Thomas Pieters made it back to the clubhouse yesterday evening propelled by parps of the purest ear-steam. The occasionally hot-headed Belgian was going along nicely at -3 with three holes to play, only to drop strokes at 7 and 9 with a face on. But presumably he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got things into proportion since \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d surely have taken an opening round of 69 given his early LIV travails \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s come out today with a fresh spring in the step and a birdie at 3. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -2. Cam Davis has no record in the majors to speak of, but he did finish tied for sixth at the Players this year. The 28-year-old Aussie followed that up with a tie for seventh at the recent RBC Heritage, just four off the eventual winner Matt Fitzpatrick, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making his move here today. A 71 yesterday, and now three consecutive birdies at 13, 14 and 15. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -2. Tom Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-out bid to top up his social-media bonus last night may have taken a toll. An opening bogey at 1 and he slips to +4. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opening birdie for Tony Finau at 10. If ever there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a man trending in the right direction, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the big 33-year-old from Salt Lake City, Utah. Having gone out in 41 strokes yesterday, he responded to that nightmare by coming back in 31. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no point wasting such card-salvaging brilliance, and today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fast start brings him up to +1. Plenty will have written him off yesterday. Ahem. Now look! So here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where we are right now at the very top of the leaderboard. Keith Mitchell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently the world number one in total driving (distance plus accuracy) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has birdied 2 to get seriously involved here. You know what, that total driving malarkey could well stand him in good stead around this US Open-esque track. Especially when the wind gets up later. Anyway, all caught up, pretty much. [wipes brow histrionically] -4: DeChambeau -3: Scheffler, Conners, D Johnson, Cole -2: Block (4*), Mitchell (2), Bradley, Hovland, Fox, Scott -1: Straka (3), Pieters (2), Rose, Suh A 46-year-old club pro is making a big move this morning. Michael Block is playing in his fifth PGA Championship \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also teed it up at two US Opens \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as a busman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holiday from his day job at Arroyo Trabuco Golf Club in Mission Viejo, California. He shot a fine 70 yesterday, coming back with birdies at 12, 13 and 16, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on a similar roll this morning. Birdies at 10 and 12, and he moves to -2, just two off Bryson DeChambeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead. An up-and-down early start for Justin Rose. He made a three-putt bogey on 16, but bounced back with a chip-in at the last to sign for a 69. But Phil Mickelson wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so adroit around 18, and a chunked chip led to a double bogey and a round of 73. The 6th hole claimed Tom Kim as a victim in the gloaming yesterday; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claimed the overnight leader Eric Cole at the break of dawn. Cole had crashed his tee shot at 6 down the middle last night, then opted to mark his ball when the horn went to end the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play. He might wish he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d gone on to complete the hole, as was his right, because his first shot this morning was a big pull into Allens Creek. That led to a double-bogey six. He gamely parred his way home after that, though, and signs for a three-under 67. Yesterday didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go exactly to plan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c certainly not for the eminently entertaining golfer-cum-explorer Tom Kim \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it looks as though the 105th PGA Championship is back on track after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frost delay. A few players, including the surprise overnight leader Eric Cole, still have a few holes of their first rounds left to play, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to suck up a quick turnaround for the second round, which looks like going ahead as scheduled. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what the top of the leaderboard looked like at sunset yesterday \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 -5: Cole (14*) -4: DeChambeau (F) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F), D Johnson (F) -2: Fox (F), Hovland (F), Bradley (F), Scott (F) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and here are today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tee times.

But what does the governor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push to crack down on issues like voter fraud actually mean for the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s residents? Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam Levine with the tale of what happened to one man who tried to vote: Just as it had been all day, courtroom 3C at the Alachua county courthouse was mostly empty when members of the jury filed in on Tuesday evening. John Boyd Rivers, a mason who once laid the bricks of the courthouse, stood up to hear whether or not they would convict him on two counts of voter fraud. Judge James Colaw read the verdict on the first charge: not guilty. Then he read the verdict on the second: guilty. Rivers stood quietly as he listened, a small hole visible in the red long-sleeve shirt he wore to court over khaki pants and work boots. It was a result that was unimaginable to Rivers, 45, who voted for the first time in his life in 2020. The odds for Republican presidential candidates who are not Donald Trump appear to be long, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean running is a bad idea. The former president is in an array of legal trouble, facing a felony indictment in New York City and an ongoing investigation by justice department special counsel Jack Smith. Meanwhile, in Georgia, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hugo Lowell reports that we could learn whether a county district attorney will bring charges against Trump or his allies in late July. If any of these matters became serious enough to knock him out of the race, candidates like Tim Scott or Ron DeSantis could benefit: The Fulton county district attorney investigating Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state of Georgia signalled Thursday that charging decisions in the case may come starting the final week of July, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. The indication from the prosecutor, Fani Willis, first came during a meeting with her full team where she told them to make preparations to work remotely during the final week of July and through the first weeks of August, the people said. Willis made no explicit mention of Trump during the meeting, but the specific timing is understood to reflect the expected window for indictments after previous indications suggested charging decisions would come during the court term that runs July to September. Two things are happening simultaneously in the Republican presidential primary field: more candidates are arriving, Donald Trump is staying as popular as ever. Just take a look at poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight for evidence of that. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead over other Republicans has only grown in recent weeks, particularly since his late-March indictment by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg. Before that, the gap between him and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite so immense, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s since yawned further. According to the New York Times, DeSantis made to donors yesterday a fairly straightforward argument: he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more electable than Trump. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have basically three people at this point that are credible in this whole thing: Biden, Trump and me. And I think of those three, two have a chance to get elected president \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Biden and me, based on all the data in the swing states, which is not great for the former president and probably insurmountable because people aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to change their view of him,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told donors. That was his message to a behind-closed-doors gathering of wealthy Republicans. In the months ahead, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find out what the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rank and file think. Good morning, US politics blog readers. Joe Biden will not be president forever. Voters will either re-elect the Democratic leader next year, or replace him with one of several Republican challengers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the ranks of those candidates are set to get even deeper in the days to come. Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, Ron DeSantis, will announce his presidential campaign on Wednesday, the Miami Herald reports, after spending months pursuing conservative policies in the state that he will argue to voters should be implemented nationally. According to the New York Times, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s given donors an even sharper message behind closed doors, saying only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Biden and me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have a chance at winning next year. The governor won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be alone in making his candidacy official. On Monday, South Carolina senator Tim Scott will make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major announcement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in North Charleston \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most likely the start of his presidential campaign. But in order to win the GOP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nomination and face Biden in the November 2024 general election, either man will have to succeed at something no Republican candidate has managed to pull off since 2016: beat Donald Trump. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a look at what we expect to happen today: Debt ceiling negotiations are ongoing in Washington DC, though a deal is not expected to be reached until the weekend or Monday, according to Punchbowl News. Joe Biden is continuing his travel in Japan and meeting with G7 leaders. Due to the time difference, his day has already pretty much wrapped up. Kamala Harris is traveling to Los Angeles, where she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll focus on maternal health in a tour of a non-profit."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/may/19/uk-rich-list-debt-ceiling-optimism-nikkei-recession-consumer-confidence-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "Tesco chair steps down; UK rich list shows Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty lost \u00c2\u00a3200m in a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c business live", "lead": "Latest Sunday Times Rich List shows first fall in the number of billionaires since the 2007-08 financial crisis.", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T13:57:27Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035753", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/783612bb12897b31b2235b7537830a2ac341c163/0_229_4500_2699/500.jpg", "body": "Back in the markets, hopes of a US debt ceiling deal are pushing stocks higher on Wall Street.

The company says it has not received any complaints about Allan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct, and makes no findings of wrongdoing, these allegations risk becoming a distraction. Three of these allegations are vigorously denied by Allan, for the other he unreservedly apologised for the comment he made, Tesco says, adding: One of the allegations related to the Tesco AGM in 2022. In response, Tesco immediately instigated an extensive review of the allegation. This has involved an internal communication to colleagues inviting them to come forward if they had concerns regarding any conduct issues and specifically at the Tesco 2022 AGM. Tesco attendees at the meeting have been further contacted, including colleagues who have since left the Company. Available video footage of the meeting has been reviewed, as have internal complaints records, including from the Company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confidential whistleblowing service. The scope of the review has been considered by external legal counsel, who advised that the steps were reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances. This review has not identified any evidence or complaints in relation to John at the Tesco 2022 AGM or at all in his tenure as Tesco Chair. On 9 May, the Guardian reported that Allan allegedly touched the bottom of a senior member of Tesco staff in June 2022, at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AGM. It was also claimed that he touched the bottom of a member of staff at the business lobbying group the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), at its annual dinner in May 2019, when he was the organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president. Sources also alleged that Allan, 74, made inappropriate remarks on those occasions as well as separate, similar comments to two other female members of CBI staff in November 2019 and in 2021 respectively. Allan has denied all but one of the allegations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c making a comment about a CBI staffer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appearance that she found to be offensive in 2019. A spokesperson for Allan said the other claims were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153simply untrue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Byron Grote, Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Senior Independent Director, says today that John Allan has made a valuable contribution, but the allegations against him risk \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbecoming a distraction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the supermarket. Grote says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153John has made a valuable contribution to Tesco during his 8 years as Chair. He has successfully led the Board through the turnaround and Covid whilst helping to rebuild the business. While we have received no complaints about John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct and made no findings of wrongdoing, these allegations risk becoming a distraction to Tesco. On behalf of the Board, I thank him for his substantial contribution to the business. We are well advanced in our search for a new Chair and will make an announcement in due course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shake-up coming at the top of one of Wall Street\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest banks. Morgan Stanley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Gorman plans to step down as chief executive officer in the next 12 months and assume the role of executive chairman, Bloomberg reports, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the board\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and my expectation that it will occur at some point in the next 12 months,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gorman, 64, said Friday at the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is the current expectation in the absence of a major change in the external environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gorman became CEO of Morgan Stanley in January 2010, when the global economy had been rocked by the financial crisis, and chairman as well two years later. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stocks hit record levels after new economic data today showed inflation pressures easing. German producer prices posted their slowest annual increase in two years in April, rising by 4.1% in the year to April. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a slowdown on March\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 6.7% rise. Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX index has just hit a record high, as signs of progress in U.S. debt ceiling negotiations encouraged investors to pile into riskier assets. The DAX index climbed 0.8% hitting 16,293 points for the first time ever. It had previously hit a record in November 2021. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gained 17% so far this year, as shares recover from hefty losses in 2022. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expanded rich list of 350 individuals and families together hold a combined wealth of \u00c2\u00a3796.459bn. At the risk of comparing flows and stocks, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s larger than the GDP of Switzerland. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also four times as large as the biggest company listed in London, AstraZeneca (\u00c2\u00a3185bn). However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barely a third of the value of Apple ($2.75trn or \u00c2\u00a32.2trn). The drop in stock market values last year has knocked some people off the rich list altogether. Those relegated include Denis Sverdlov, the entrepreneur behind the electric vehicle manufacturer Arrival. Arrival listed on the US Nasdaq index in March 2021 at a valuation of roughly $13bn (\u00c2\u00a39.5bn). Today, though, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value has dropped to $35m (\u00c2\u00a328m). Internet entrepreneur Alex Chesterman has also failed to hit the \u00c2\u00a3350m wealth needed to get into the list, following the 99% plunge in the share price of his car-selling start-up, Cazoo. In the car sector\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the UK government has offered Jaguar Land Rover \u00c2\u00a3500m in subsidies in an effort to persuade the company to build a new electric battery plant in the UK. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has offered a package of incentives to entice JLR, days after three global carmakers warned that Brexit rules on where parts were sourced threatened the future of the British automotive industry. The Indian conglomerate Tata, the parent company of JLR, is in the process of deciding whether to build the new electric battery production facility in the UK or Spain. The Treasury package includes a mixture of a cash grant and reductions in energy costs as well as covering the cost of upgrading the power network around the site JLR has identified in Somerset, according to the Times.

Unite said hundreds of its members at Bilfinger UK will stage two 48-hour strikes, starting on 1 June and 8 June. The union said the workers had rejected a basic pay rise of 6%, which was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd real-terms pay cut as UK inflation is in double digit levels. Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offshore members working for Bilfinger have given a loud and clear answer to the company and oil operators. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Simply put, below-inflation pay offers from a sector awash with billions in record profits is unacceptable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our members remain resolute in their fight to secure good jobs, pay and conditions across the offshore sector, and they will have Unite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full support.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Inflation remains the biggest concern for Britons, followed by the health system. When asked about the important issues facing the UK today, the Office for National Statistics reports, the most commonly reported issues continue to be the cost of living (91%), the NHS (82%), the economy (73%), and climate change and the environment (59%). The ONS adds: Around two-thirds of (67%) adults reported that their cost of living had increased, compared with a month ago. The most common reasons reported by adults who said their cost of living had increased compared with a month ago were an increase in the price of food shopping (96%), an increase in gas or electricity bills (74%), and an increase in the price of fuel (38%). Nationwide will pay \u00c2\u00a3340m directly into customer accounts for the first time, after a jump in deposits and higher interest rates drove annual profits up 40% to record highs. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest building society has tended to use profits to offer better rates on savings, loans and mortgages for its members but on Friday it launched an inaugural programme that will distribute funds directly to customers, akin to shareholder payouts made by banks. The payout, which amounts to about 15% of its annual profits, will benefit 3.4 million eligible customers, who will receive about \u00c2\u00a3100 directly into their accounts in June. The Nationwide chief executive, Debbie Crosbie, said plans for the payout were influenced by the recent rise in living costs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anyone else doing this, as such, and we think, in the cost of living crisis, it was really important to get people cash where we could, and we think it will have the most impact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It comes as Nationwide reported a 40% jump in annual pre-tax profits to \u00c2\u00a32.2bn, topping its previous record high of \u00c2\u00a31.6bn a year earlier. The building society benefited from the rise in UK interest rates, which have climbed to 4.5% over the past year and allowed lenders to charge customers more for loans and mortgages. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billionaires will be pleased to learn that global shares have hit a one-month high today, amid rising hopes of a deal to lift the US debt ceiling. MSCI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broadest index of global shares has gained 0.2% to its highest level since mid-April, and is on course for its biggest weekly gain since late March. In Europe, Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DAX is on track for a record closing high, up 0.6% this morning. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 0.5% or 35 points to 7778 points. The rally came after Democratic negotiators told President Joe Biden they were making \u00e2\u20ac\u0153steady progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on a deal to lift the U.S. debt ceiling, and avoid a disastrous default by the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy. As covered in the introduction, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also sounded optimistic last night, saying talks are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a much better place\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than they were a week ago. While the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s billionaires keep getting richer, the rest of the country is facing a new phase in the cost of living squeeze. The food price shock set to overtake energy bills rise as the biggest cost of living hit to family finances, the Resolution Foundation warn this morning. We get April\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflation data next Wednesday, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to show a drop in price rises over the last year (as we catch up with the soaring energy costs in 2022). But food inflation, which jumped over 19% in March, is likely to persist for some time to come. Resolution say: As a result, food prices are set to contribute more to overall inflation than energy in the months ahead. Between March and September 2023, food prices are expected to contribute around 2 percentage points to inflation each month, while the contribution of energy prices is set to fall from 3 percentage points to less than 1. These rising food prices will hit poorer households the most, as Resolution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO Torsten Bell explains here: Sir Jim Ratcliffe looks to be the biggest riser on this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rich List, as he secured second place with a fortune of \u00c2\u00a329bn. Ratcliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth swelled by \u00c2\u00a323bn in the last year, rising from \u00c2\u00a36.075bn in 2022 (which put him in 29th position). The Sunday Times explains how the energy crisis following Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s benefitted his INEOS group: The self-made billionaire, part-time mountaineer and beekeeper built his fortune snapping up orphaned petrochemical plants from companies such as BP and ICI and turning them into going concerns. When energy prices rocketed and Europe shivered at the start of the Ukraine war, he was on hand with a fleet of 20 ocean-going tankers to shuttle shale gas from the US, some from his own fracking wells. A few years ago, Ratcliffe quit Britain for tax-free Monaco, a move expected to save him billions of pounds in tax. Despite their wealth dropping (to \u00c2\u00a3529m from \u00c2\u00a3730m), Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better placed than most to weather the cost of living crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says the Sunday Times, with some understatement. They explain: Their main London home is a five-bedroom Kensington mews house worth an estimated \u00c2\u00a37m. Soon after the row over Murty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax status erupted, the family moved out of Downing Street and back into their west London home. The couple also own a flat on Old Brompton Road nearby, usually used for hosting friends and family. In 2015 they spent \u00c2\u00a31.5m on a Georgian manor house in the North Yorkshire village of Kirby Sigston to serve as a constituency home. Estate agents estimate that the 12m x 5m indoor swimming pool, gym, yoga studio, hot tub and tennis court added by the couple have pushed the property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s value beyond \u00c2\u00a32m. We also have a new breakdown of the wealthiest 35 Brits under the age of 35. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s topped by the Duke of Westminster, Hugh Grosvenor, who announced his engagement to Olivia Henson last month. He has a weath of \u00c2\u00a39.878bn. Grosvenor, 32, owns more than 300 acres in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Mayfair and Belgravia within a global, family-owned property empire which, luckily for him, is held in trust so avoided inheritance tax. The Sunday Times has more detail on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hughie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparently known to friends: The duke, 32, was educated at the Shropshire private school Ellesmere College and studied real estate management at Newcastle University. After graduating he worked for Bio-bean, the London-based eco-business which has since become the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest recycler of coffee grounds into efficient and sustainable products. His fianc\u00c3\u00a9e is a senior account manager for Belazu, a food importer. These days the duke focuses on overseeing his family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charitable foundation, which has a focus on the mental health of children, and the property empire that includes 300 acres of Mayfair and Belgravia as well as buildings in more than 40 cities around the world. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rich List reports that nepotism helped nine people get on the list, but most made their millions on their own. It says: The majority made millions on their own, but nine were born into money. Those who inherited wealth are worth much more. So, 33 out of 38 individuals on this list built their fortunes themselves, a combined total of \u00c2\u00a35.8 billion; the other five, who owe at least some of their wealth to inheritance, account for \u00c2\u00a313.1 billion. Four of the 35 under 35 were born outside the UK, the others mostly come from London or Worcestershire. About half attended state schools, and at least a third didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go on to further education. Five were friends at the same school, South Bromsgrove High School, including Ben Francis, 30, co-founder of the sportswear brand Gymshark Hughie Grovesnor is followed on the list by Lady Charlotte Wellesley (\u00c2\u00a32.167bn), the daughter of the Duke of Wellington, who has married into a South American brewing dynasty, Johnny Boufarhat (\u00c2\u00a31.714bn) who built the video-conference app Hopin, Ben Francis (\u00c2\u00a3900m), and India Rose James (\u00c2\u00a3758m) the granddaughter of the property magnate and porn publisher Paul Raymond. James, who founded the art gallery Soho Revue, insists her financial success shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be put down to nepotism. In an interview published this morning, the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPrincess of Soho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 says: At a party recently someone was complaining about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nepo babies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a few faces turned to me. What can I say? I was left money, which undoubtedly gave me a leg up. But I set up the gallery on my own; I pay a higher percentage to the artists than most galleries because I want to invest in the creative community. If I inherit some money, does that make me a nepo baby? I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think so. Famous names on the 35-under-35 list include Ed Sheeran (\u00c2\u00a3300m), Rory McIlroy (\u00c2\u00a3200m), Adele (\u00c2\u00a3165m), Harry Styles (\u00c2\u00a3150m), Daniel Radcliffe (\u00c2\u00a392m), Dua Lipa (\u00c2\u00a375m), Gareth Bale (\u00c2\u00a370m), Raheem Sterling (\u00c2\u00a361m), Emma Watson (\u00c2\u00a360m), Niall Horan (\u00c2\u00a354m), Louis Tomlinson (\u00c2\u00a354m), Harry Kane (\u00c2\u00a351m) and Cara Delevingne (\u00c2\u00a350m). Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rich List, which shows Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 171 billionaires collectively own over \u00c2\u00a3683.8bn, shows the urgent need to tackle inequality, the IPPR thinktank say. Dr George Dibb, head of the centre for economic justice at IPPR, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While a rising number of households on the lowest incomes simply cannot pay their bills, the fact that a few of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest people have seen dips in their wealth is outweighed by the growth in combined wealth of the 171 billionaires. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sky-high energy bills have fed into record profits for oil firms, who have passed this directly to those lucky enough to be shareholders, funnelling higher bill payments by everyone into the wealth of the richest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more urgent than ever to address rising inequality in our economy: income from wealth should be taxed at the same rate as income from work, and we must ensure everyone benefits from a growing economy, not just a lucky few. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That means aligning rates of income tax, capital gains tax, and tax on dividends. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also time for a fair, proportional property tax to replace the regressive system of council tax. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long past time to ditch non-dom status.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can see the Rich List online here: The Sunday Times Rich List 2023 revealed. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tweeted the key points too: Other fallers on this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK Rich List include Matt Moulding, the founder of the online retailer THG, and Mike Lynch, who cofounded the cybersecurity firm Darktrace. Moulding and his wife Jodie have fallen to 254th, from 230th, with their wealth dropping by \u00c2\u00a370m to \u00c2\u00a3630m. Shares in THG dropped by over 70% in 2022, as the company failed to meet the expectations set when it floated at a \u00c2\u00a35.4bn valuation in 2020. Its value has shrunk by almost 90% since. Darktrace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s float has been volatile too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after an early surge, the stock has dropped back towards its IPO price in 2021. Lynch, and wife Angela Bacares, together own around 10% of Darktrace. They dropped to 199 on this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rich List, from 179, with their net worth down \u00c2\u00a3136m to \u00c2\u00a3852m. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Lynch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only problem, though. Last week he was extradited to the US to face criminal fraud charges, which he denies, of duping the US firm Hewlett-Packard into overpaying when it struck an $11bn deal for his software firm Autonomy in 2011. Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t along in becoming poorer last year, and are far from the biggest fallers. The Sunday Times reports: In 12 months Sir Richard Branson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortune has shrunk by 42.6% to \u00c2\u00a32.41bn. Shares in his satellite venture, Virgin Orbit, have collapsed. Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, easyJet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, is another high-profile faller. The budget airline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price has continued to lose altitude and the other lines in his easy empire have failed to make up for it. A year ago, Branson and family were 44th on the Rich List, with a fortune of \u00c2\u00a34.2bn. This time, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dropped to 77th with a net worth of \u00c2\u00a32.41bn. Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty saw their wealth slide last year, the Sunday Times Rich List shows. The prime minister and his wife made their Rich List debut in 2022 thanks to the near-1% stake Murty owns in Infosys, the Indian IT giant co-founded by her father. But this time round, the prime minister and his wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealth is estimated at \u00c2\u00a3201m less than 12 months ago. That works out as an average daily loss of more than \u00c2\u00a3500,000. Their net worth is estimated at \u00c2\u00a3529m this year, down from \u00c2\u00a3730m in 2022. This is due to a slide in Infosys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s share price, which fell by over a fifth during 2022, as the boom in tech stocks unravelled. But Infosys has continued to swell the Sunak-Murty coffers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Akshata will receive nearly \u00c2\u00a36.7m in dividend payments from the company this summer, Murty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lucrative dividends from Infosys over the years far exceed the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own earnings, the Sunday Times says, adding; He published financial statements that showed he earned just under \u00c2\u00a32 million in 2021/22 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d still more than 50 times the average full-time UK salary. It included his MP and ministerial wages as well as returns from his investment portfolio and other unspecified \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On all this he paid \u00c2\u00a3432,493 of tax, according to information from his wealth adviser released by the government. These are the 20 richest people and families in the UK, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, released this morning. Gopi Hinduja and family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a335bn Sir Jim Ratcliffe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a329.7bn Sir Leonard Blavatnik \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a328.6bn David and Simon Reuben and family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a324.4bn Sir James Dyson and family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a323bn Lakshmi Mittal and family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a316bn Guy, George, Alannah and Galen Weston and family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a314.5bn Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken and Michel de Carvalho \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a313.1bn Kirsten and Jorn Rausing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a312bn Michael Platt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a311.5bn The Duke of Westminster and the Grosvenor family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a39.9bn Marit, Lisbet, Sigrid and Hans Rausing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a39.3bn Andy Currie \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a39.2bn John Reece \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a39.1bn Alex Gerko \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a39.1bn Denise, John and Peter Coates and family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a38.8bn Anders Holch Povlsen \u00c2\u00a38.5bn Barnaby and Merlin Swire and family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a38.4bn John Fredriksen and family \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a38.3bn Mikhail Fridman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00c2\u00a38.2bn The billionaire Hinduja family have topped the Sunday Times Rich List again as their fortune jumped by more than \u00c2\u00a36bn last year. The annual assessment of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealthiest people, just released, found that Gopi Hinduja and his family, which is behind the Indian conglomerate Hinduja Group, are Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest. This comes just days after Mr Hinduja\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother Sri died. This is the fifth time the Indian-born family have topped the Rich List, making them the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wealthiest dynasty. The Hindujas were followed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the boss of the INEOS chemicals company, who is now bidding to take control of Manchester United. But for the first time in 14 years, the number of billionaires on the list has fallen, by six to 171. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first top drop since the 2007-08 financial crisis, after heavy falls in international markets last year. However, those whose wealth clocked in at at least ten-digits have grown even richer. The amount of wealth shared by UK billionaires climbed to \u00c2\u00a3683.8bn, which is almost \u00c2\u00a331bn more than last year. But, with inflation in double digits, that 4.5% rise represents a fall in real terms. The Sunday Times, which has been weighing the wallets of the wealthy for many years, reports that the boomtime is over: The Rich List has laid bare a golden era for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most minted for more than a decade. Each year the billionaire count rose. Each year their fortunes soared ever higher. The question was not whether the boom would end, but when \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and what it would mean for the rest of us. That time has come. The party is over and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to sober up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Years of cheap, cheap money ramped up the value of our companies and made it easier to expand,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one anonymous billionaire retailer who has seen his wealth clipped in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rich List. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of us did very well out of it. The recession never turned up and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it will. Time for everyone to get back to work, get their heads down and frankly be a bit more sensible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK has finally announced its strategy to support the semiconductor industry, but the plan has been quickly criticised for being too small. The 20-year National Semiconductor Strategy will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double down on design, research and advanced chip leadership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to secure the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position as a global science and technology superpower, the government says. The package will aim to boost the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strengths and skills in design, R&amp;D and compound semiconductors, and grow UK chip firms. As the government points out, the semiconductor marketis set to grow to $1 trillion by 2030, which is why other countries have been offering large subsidies to their industries. And the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s package, worth \u00c2\u00a31bn over the next decade, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, according to some experts. Cambridge-based startup, Paragraf, which claims to be the only company in the world capable of manufacturing graphene to mass-produce semiconductors, said the taxpayer commitment would not cover a basic chip plant. Its founder and chief executive, Simon Thomas, said the content of the strategy revealed so far was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frankly flaccid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Thomas said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strategy continues the trend of this Conservative administration proclaiming superlatives like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbecoming a technology superpower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 without defining what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuperpower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actually means or delivering a plan of how we will even begin to reach this objective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Confidence among UK consumers is recovering, as people grow more optimistic over their personal financial situation and the economic outlook. GfK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Consumer Confidence Index, released overnight, has risen by three points this month to -27 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the fourth monthly increase in a row. Although still negative, the outlook has improved since January when the index clocked in at -45. Confidence in personal finances over the coming 12 months jumped by five points, to -8, which is 17 points higher than this time last year. Joe Staton, client strategy director at GfK, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cost-of-living crisis has been part of our daily financial reality for a long time, with double-digit inflation and record-high food prices. But despite those pressures, May sees an encouraging three-point uptick in consumer confidence. This is the fourth monthly increase in a row from January\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s score of -45. While Brits have little control over the general economy, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to see further improvement in how people view their personal finances in the next 12 months with a robust five-point jump to -8. This measure most keenly reflects our hopes and fears for the coming year, and it underpins our ability to spend on goods and services that drive our economy. Of course, confidence is still far from the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsunny uplands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 territory, Staton adds: However, the overall trajectory this year is positive and might reflect a stronger underlying financial picture across the UK than many would think. But everybody must hold on tight as it could still be a rocky ride out of these tough times.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue-chip stock index has climbed to a 33-year high today, lifted by optimism over the US debt ceiling deadlock. The Nikkei climbed by another 0.77% today to close at 30,808.35 today. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s its highest level since August 1990, when Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stock market bubble was bursting. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rally came amid rising hopes that US politicians will hammer out a deal on the debt ceiling to avoid a catastrophic default. Last night, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck an optimistic tone about reaching a deal with President Biden to raise the debt ceiling in time to avoid a default. McCarthy told reporters that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I see the path that we can come to an agreement, and I think we have a structure now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McCarthy, who met with the president and other congressional leaders earlier this week, said talks are in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a much better place\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than they were a week ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know and I can see where a deal can come together, and I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McCarthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republicans had been demanding hefty spending cuts in return for approving a lifting of the debt ceiling. US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen has repeatedly warned that the consequences of not increasing the debt limit could be disastrous. Yesterday, Yellen told bank CEOs that failing to raise or suspend the debt limit would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catastrophic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the financial system, families and businesses. So far this year, the Nikkei has gained around 19%, outpacing other major markets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are also looking calmer today. Reuters points out that a series of strong corporate results, an economy that is showing signs of a revival and a renewed interest from foreign investors in the wake of increased investment by Warrant Buffett has also boosted the Nikkei. But despite the recent rally, the Nikkei is still below its alltime peak over 36,000 set in 1989.

The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has put forward a package of incentives to entice JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, days after three global carmakers warned that Brexit rules on where parts were sourced threatened the future of the British automotive industry. The Indian conglomerate Tata, the parent company of JLR, is in the process of deciding whether to build the new electric battery production facility in the UK or Spain. The Treasury package includes a mixture of a cash grant and reductions in energy costs as well as covering the cost of upgrading the power network and transport connections around the site identified in Somerset, a government source said. The Times first reported that the government was willing to meet Tata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request for \u00c2\u00a3500m, after months of negotiations. The government has also offered its parent company, Tata, which also owns UK businesses including Tetley Tea, a \u00c2\u00a3300m package to help upgrade and decarbonise its Port Talbot steelworks facility in south Wales. Last year, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the chair of Tata, said that if the group could not negotiate significant subsidies from the government to help transition the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blastfurnaces to greener production methods it would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have to look at closures of sites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Port Talbot site employs about 3,500 people and is one of only two plants in Britain capable of turning iron ore and coal into molten iron and steel. Overall, the subsidiary Tata Steel UK employs about 8,000 people. The \u00c2\u00a3500m offer to JLR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner represents a major commitment from the UK government, with the total budget for its automotive transformation fund, which aims to support the British car industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shift to electric vehicles, currently only at \u00c2\u00a31bn. The UK government tends to support most large automotive factory investments with subsidies worth between 10% and 20% of the cost of the project. Ministers have come under intense political pressure to offer support to a battery factory to supply JLR in particular because it owns more factories in the UK than any other carmaker. The JLR chief executive, Adrian Mardell, last week said that the company would retain its car factories in the UK even if Tata decides to build the gigafactory in Spain. However, many auto industry analysts are concerned that a failure to produce batteries in the UK will make future investments by carmakers less attractive. The UK only has one gigafactory under construction, Chinese-owned Envision AESC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s site near Nissan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunderland car plant. Post-Brexit rules require 40% of an electric vehicle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parts by value to be sourced in the UK or EU if it is to be sold on the other side of the Channel without a 10% trade tariff. This proportion is due to rise to 45% next year, and by 2027 carmakers will need to source the entire battery pack from within the EU or UK to avoid the tariffs when exporting. Because most electric vehicle batteries are still imported from Asia, and batteries make up a large part of the cost of building a car, some carmakers claim their vehicles made in the UK and the EU are likely to fall foul of the rules. On Wednesday, Stellantis, which owns the Vauxhall, Peugeot and Citro\u00c3\u00abn brands, said it could be forced to shut some of its UK operations if the Brexit deal was not renegotiated. Ford, which makes electric cars in Germany and parts in the UK, said the requirement would add \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pointless cost to customers wanting to go green\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to fly to the US for his funeral. Mike (not his real name) was the brother I wish I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d grown up with. We met when I lived in the States for three months. When I proposed to my future husband, I wanted Mike to be my best man. We used to go to the same church and when I realised that a life of celibacy as a gay Christian, denying who I truly am, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to work, Mike was one of the few church friends who stuck by me. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how Mike died. He struggled with painkillers and alcohol, as well as mental health at times. Since he died, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in occasional contact with members of his family but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring myself to ask the cause of death. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wondering whether I could ask \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and if so, how to frame the question sensitively \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to get a sense of closure. Is this appropriate? I miss Mike all the time. I miss that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be at my wedding in July. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sad that no one will get to hear his best man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech and that we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to see him tear up the dancefloor with his dad moves. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m struggling to get past this feeling of emptiness because I no longer have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153best mate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to shoot the breeze with. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a space I expect my fiance to fill; I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthy for us to have our own friends to be authentic and share concerns with. Will I ever lose this sense of emptiness, or can I grow around this? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so sorry for your loss. To have a friend who sees you and accepts you for who you are is truly special. One of my closest friends died (of a drugs overdose) and I became obsessed with how she died. Looking back, I realise I felt that if I knew every detail, I could have gone back in time to stop it from happening. But I was also trying to get control of a situation which was totally out of my control, and I wonder if maybe that is happening for you. Also, you are having to come to terms with the fact that there is this huge detail about your friend that you do not know. I went to UKCP registered psychotherapist John Cavanagh. He wondered if you might consider \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imagining the sort of speech Mike would have written, maybe with help from his friends, and writing it out and putting it in your pocket so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close to you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Or you could write a letter to Mike and tell him what he meant to you and keep that in a pocket. I used to pooh-pooh writing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153letters that are never sent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but they can be amazingly cathartic. You didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say anything about your family. Cavanagh wondered how accepting they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been of your sexuality and if Mike \u00e2\u20ac\u0153represented an approving male figure you otherwise didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have in your own family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In terms of asking Mike\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family about his death, Cavanagh says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to invite you to think about Mike the way you knew him and not let his battles define him. I would also think carefully about what you might expect the answer [how Mike died] to be. The answer may not match your expectations and can cause more stress or more \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsearching\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to add: do not let the way he died define him. But if you build a relationship with them, you might find it comes naturally to ask one day. Although bear in mind that if they are religious and there is any perceived shame in the way he died, they may not want to share it. Mike will always be part of your life. Grief is a massive emotion that can take years to process; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very early days and of course you feel his loss. But you can and will grow around it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I call it folding it into your life. I was told a wonderful analogy by a bereavement counsellor which is that life is a glass and grief is a yellow ball. Sometimes the ball is so big it threatens to break the glass: sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so small you can hardly see it. The yellow ball never changes size, but the glass \u00e2\u20ac\u201c life \u00e2\u20ac\u201c does. You may find the grief podcast I did helpful. And you might also want to look at bereavement counselling. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Every week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

She is also polite, amiable and a committed Christian who has made a new home for herself in the small and quiet town of Vernon, Connecticut, where she trains for her fights. Ten days ago, just before she flew home to Dublin to prepare herself for the seething atmosphere she will generate on Saturday night at the 3Arena when she steps into the ring to face Chantelle Cameron in a difficult battle for the undisputed world super-lightweight title, Taylor explained why she loved Vernon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The peace and quiet out here is amazing. There is nothing to do other than train as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the middle of nowhere. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the perfect spot for me. The tranquillity suits my personality. You very rarely see even a car driving by, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how quiet it is. Nowadays this place feels like my home away from home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her fascinating bout against Cameron will mark the first time that Taylor, who is a fighter to her very core once the bell rings, has been able to box professionally in Ireland. The gangland strife between the Kinahan and Hutch cartels has resulted in the murder of 18 people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most infamous of which occurred with the killing of David Byrne at a boxing weigh-in in Dublin in February 2016. Police believe that the gunmen had been aiming to assassinate Daniel Kinahan, the leader of a drug-dealing and money-laundering empire which is said to be worth over a billion dollars, and the murderous tit-for-tat reprisals which followed meant that professional boxing was considered too dangerous to take place in Ireland. Taylor has been a professional boxer since November 2016. She is the most high-profile fighter to have been affected by the unofficial ban on all but a few small-hall Irish boxing shows over the past seven years. Taylor is so good in the ring, however, that she still established herself as the most significant and richest female boxer in the world. But her belated home debut as a professional is fraught with considerable risk. She had hoped to fight Amanda Serrano in a rematch of their epic contest which, last April, became the first women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bout to headline Madison Square Garden. It was a thrilling and brutal fight which Taylor almost lost when she was hurt badly by Serrano in the middle rounds. She had hoped to face Serrano again for her Dublin return at Croke Park, in front of a sold-out 82,000 crowd, but her Puerto Rican rival has been struggling with injury. It has been said that Taylor would have filled the 3Arena, which will be crammed with 10,000 fans on Saturday, even if she just pummelled a heavy bag in an exhibition workout. But she chose a formidable replacement for Serrano in the unbeaten Cameron, who has won all 17 of her fights without being unduly troubled. Taylor called out Cameron, in a display of bravado she normally shuns, for she felt that her return to Ireland warranted a compelling challenge. She moves up from lightweight, where she is the undisputed world champion, to face the taller and heavier Cameron who holds all the belts in her division. Cameron is three inches taller than Taylor, with the same advantage in terms of her reach, and by the time they have eaten well and fully rehydrated after Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weigh-in she will carry more than the five pounds which are meant to separate them as lightweight and super-lightweight champions. Taylor is also, at 36, nearly five years older than Cameron and she has been through many more wars than her English rival in winning all her 22 fights. Yet Taylor is, clearly, the more naturally gifted fighter, and an Olympic champion, who has boxed at a higher level than Cameron throughout her storied amateur and professional career. She said recently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this could be the hardest fight of my career\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but, when the bout was first mooted in 2020, Taylor welcomed the idea. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We fought as amateurs and I beat her. Chantelle is obviously a great fighter but I am happy and willing to fight whoever. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk bad to anyone, and I guess my career has shown that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cameron has said before that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m coming to take over\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when predicting she will become the dominant force in women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boxing. She has also insisted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say much. But, when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in the ring, I just walk through people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yet she has never fought in an atmosphere as fevered as the clamour that will engulf her during Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s homecoming bout. Cameron also knows that, even if she is the champion of her division, she faces the most beloved sporting personality in Ireland. If the fight is close, which is likely, the woman from Northampton will be entitled to worry that the three judges could be swayed by the enormous noise that will accompany every successful punch Taylor lands. It will be a test of Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nerve for Taylor has been in contests of similar magnitude before. Of course all these gruelling and emotional bouts have taken their toll on Taylor who, in recent years, has shown some of the wear and tear of the cruel fight business. The quiet woman from Bray still loves the ferocious heat of battle and she will be more determined than ever to win her first professional fight at home. But Taylor would be advised to rely on her superior ringcraft and vast experience rather than lose herself in the kind of savage fight that she relishes.

Even a trip to the G7 summit in Japan was not far enough, with reporters on the flight asking directly whether the prime minister intended to stick to Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 manifesto pledge to bring net immigration down. Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response was, at best, evasive, and included the suggestion that he blamed the rise in foreign workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a leading factor in driving up figures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve inherited some numbers, I want to bring the numbers down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Pushed as to whether he stood by Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pledge, he refused to do so, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said I do want to bring legal migration down. I think illegal migration is undoubtedly the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priority, and you can see all the work I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m putting into that as well. But on legal migration as well we are committed to bringing those numbers down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His refusal to reiterate Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise has done little to calm a briefing war that has raged all week between members of Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cabinet over whether the UK should issue more visas for foreign staff in industries short of workers. Sources from the Treasury, the Department for Education and the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have argued for more workers from overseas to be allowed to enter the UK. In the opposing camp, Suella Braverman has publicly claimed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mass\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd migration is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsustainable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and has called for cuts in the number of visas offered to foreign workers and students. As the home secretary she has proposed a number of visa restrictions on workers, students and their families, but sources close to her say that none have so far been signed off. As the arguments rumble on, the Office for National Statistics is preparing to publish the latest net immigration figures, which are expected to exceed 700,000, up from 504,000 last year. In 2019, when Johnson made his election pledge to cut the numbers, the total was 271,000. In a call to her core supporters, widely interpreted as groundwork for a future leadership attempt, Braverman said work visas should be cut and thousands of Britons should be trained to drive trucks, work in the meat industry and gather crops, rather than employers relying on foreign workers. She told the National Conservatism conference on Monday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to get overall immigration numbers down. And we mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget how to do things for ourselves.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Braverman, who said last year she would like to see net immigration return to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tens of thousands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said the government must fulfil the promise of Brexit and control UK borders. Close observers of migration figures say Brexit caused labour shortages across many industries. When the withdrawal agreement came into force on 31 January 2020, it ended free movement between the UK and the EU, meaning EU citizens could no longer work in the UK without a visa. A report issued last year by the Migration Observatory, at the University of Oxford, said the end of free movement had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exacerbated recruitment issues faced by UK employers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. These were also worsened by the Covid pandemic. It said industries that relied most heavily on EU workers, such as hospitality, transport, construction and agriculture, had been hit particularly hard and had struggled to adjust to new immigration rules making many posts ineligible for overseas recruitment. Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government responded to labour shortages by reducing the income and skills thresholds for skilled migrant visas, and expanding the opportunities for student migrants to bring family members and to work after their studies were completed. The report said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Employers in some industries, such as agriculture, have been able to switch from EU to non-EU workers after the end of free movement, but in most low-wage industries, the immigration system does not permit them to do this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some shortages are transient and resolve of their own accord over time, although the process of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcadjustment\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 may be disruptive for employers who cannot reduce their labour needs through alternatives, such as automation. This has led to calls for work visa schemes to mitigate the impacts for employers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd According to Madeleine Sumption, the head of the Migration Observatory, there is no right way to decide which low- or middle-wage jobs should be eligible for work visas. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government chose to make private-sector roles, like butchers and chefs, eligible for work visas, and it can reverse that decision if it wants to. The overall impacts of this for the UK economy would probably be relatively small. Indeed, some industries with lots of middle-skilled jobs, such as construction, already make relatively low use of work visas,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Care workers were by far the main cohort of the increase in visas issued to foreign workers last year, when 268,000 were provided, almost twice as many as the last pre-pandemic year of 2019. In December 2021 it was announced that care workers would be added to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shortage occupation list, which makes it easier for certain industries experiencing labour shortages to recruit from overseas. The move was in response to pressures in the sector caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and the decision of many EU workers to return home during lockdown and not return. It allowed care homes to recruit overseas workers paid \u00c2\u00a310.75 an hour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just above the minimum wage. The number of foreign workers coming to the UK to work in the health and care sector last year was almost two-and-a-half times higher than the year before. The number of health and care visas issued last year, 77,000, was the highest for any sector. Sumption said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government has quite a lot of control over this sector, since it funds training places and sets, or otherwise directly influences, pay. But health and care employers have faced significant shortages of workers and have become increasingly reliant on overseas workers. The reasons for this are complex, and include low pay in social care and insufficient training and retention to meet NHS workforce demand. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the government wants to reduce overseas recruitment, it has policy levers it could pull \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a cost, of course \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as addressing the funding crisis in social care.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ministers are waiting to see whether Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to back Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy represents a fundamental shift in policy towards overall immigration. The home secretary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team claims that her immigration policies still chime with Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. It remains to be seen, however, whether he is willing to continue to back her and risk further splits with other cabinet colleagues."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/19/how-to-have-sex-review-an-education-in-consent-for-24-hour-party-people", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "How to Have Sex review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an education in consent for 24 hour party people", "lead": "Tara and her friends decamp to a garish holiday resort on the lookout for her first sexual experience in Molly Manning Walker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong debut feature", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T13:00:29Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035776", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f4b2653d7585edaca2c7c9eb230d4578e43e41e2/0_455_8192_4918/500.jpg", "body": "Full-on energy, likable performances and uncompromisingly daft jokes turbocharge this debut feature from British film-maker Molly Manning Walker, about three teenage girls up for the holiday of a lifetime in the party town of Malia in Crete, and trying not to think about the exam results which their parents could tactlessly text them at any moment. The film delivers an intriguingly sympathetic, complex and even mysterious performance from Mia McKenna-Bruce as the shyest of the trio: Tara, whose face in closeup registers subtly shifting moods. For her, the quest for sex means more than for the others. She has still not had experience. Manning Walker herself coolly manages the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own mood, drifting towards crisis and retreating from it. Tara, or Taz, and her mates Skye (Lara Peake) and Em (Enva Lewis) show up and get a room overlooking the pool in one of the resort hotels along Malia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main street: at night pulsing with garish neon drunkenness and during the day eerily deserted, like the location for a gunfight in a western. On one horrendously hungover morning on the balcony, Tara is aware of a young man on the next-door balcony looking at her. This is the goofy Badger (Shaun Thomas), there with his mates; he senses something of her loneliness and desperation to get sex out of the way. But of course Tara wants this to happen with the right candidate: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a moment for which, unlike A-levels, there are no retakes. Poor Badger naturally wants to pull himself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but in a million different ways puts himself in the friend zone with Tara, and part of their complex chemistry is that both perhaps want friendship more. It is Badger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sexier, more boorish and insensitive mate Paddy (Samuel Bottomley) who takes Tara for a walk on the beach one night and meanwhile there is a connection between Em and a gay girl in the boys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room: Paige (Laura Ambler). But as the situation with Paddy progresses, amid the 24/7 bacchanal of pool parties and club nights led by robo-cheery reps, the exact nature of the resulting event is left in question, and the title itself assumes a multiple-meaning. With banteringly concealed envy Skye asks Tara how it was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Did he throw you around and that?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Did he? Does Tara want to remember it that way? Does she want to remember it at all? Consent is ambiguous. The film shows that the post-sex phase in Tara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind is perhaps composed of an inner negotiation: should she forget it and move on? This is an interestingly unsentimental film, without the coming-of-age cliches, and one from which the three leads emerge stronger and happier than before."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/may/19/daisy-jones-the-six-is-a-blueprint-for-delicious-holiday-style", "primaryCategory": "fashion", "title": "Daisy Jones & the Six is a blueprint for delicious holiday style | Jess Cartner-Morley", "lead": "From denim shorts to floaty blouses, the breezy 70s-style outfits in this show are perfect for summer", "author": "Jess Cartner-Morley", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T13:00:29Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035780", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2d6ae54a39d3100552f82cc585c8d76ab25efb55/0_335_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "A rock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122roll saga of love triangles, cocaine and tour buses might not sound of immediate relevance to your real-life summer holiday. Or hey, maybe it does \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no judgment! Either way, if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watched Daisy Jones &amp; the Six, the Amazon Prime ten-parter, then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m here to tell you that you really, really should. Mainly you should watch it because it is just so much fun. Sexy, gripping, atmospheric, the sofa-viewing equivalent of a perfect sunlounger summer novel. (It is based on Taylor Jenkins Reid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perfect sunlounger read of the same name.) But specifically you should watch it for its wardrobe, because it is a blueprint for the most delicious summer-holiday style. Daisy Jones &amp; the Six is the story of a rock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122roll band in 1970s California, by which I mean it is basically the story of Fleetwood Mac (the makers said they were partly inspired by the band). Guitar cases and whisky bottles and intimate love-hate duets sung up close and personal on stage in front of thousands. And the clothes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c oh, the clothes! Breezy, floaty, semi-transparent blouses. Crochet vests and denim shorts. Faded T-shirts and cool fringed tapestry coats and skinny scarves. Finished with long tangled blond fringes and big dark glasses. It is summer style bliss, and it translates surprisingly well to non-rock-star life. Floaty, semi-transparent Stevie Nicks-esque kimono-type garments with trailing sleeves look incredible backlit under stage lighting, but they are also genuinely practical to have on holiday. They take up no space in a suitcase, work as a beach cover up over a swimsuit and can be layered over a T-shirt and jeans at night to protect you from chills and bugs. Crochet is the ultimate breathable summer fabric, with built-in air-con. Cut-off denim shorts are a stone cold classic. Riley Keough as singer Daisy Jones channels Nicks, with a side order of Joni Mitchell, in louche, ethereal layers and the kind of vintage-looking lace-edged button-through top that I comb every single market stall for every single time I go on holiday. Suki Waterhouse as keyboardist Karen (Christine McVie, with a bit of Patti Smith) makes a strong case for the fitted waistcoat as a summer vest. Camila Morrone as photographer Camila has an on-screen collection of loose maxi dresses that call to mind Ali MacGraw, alongside some Bianca Jagger-esque pale tailoring. Theatrical? Well, yes, obviously, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to stick my neck out and say no more so than the Love Island look which has dominated recent summers. Those complicated swimsuits with crisscrossed straps that the girls wear in the villa \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fancy my chances getting changed into one of those huddled under a towel on the beach. Corset tops? Not what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to reach for when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m supposed to be having a relaxing time, thank you very much. Tight dresses when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot, yuck. And as for belly button windows \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Daisy Jones look, by contrast, is high-octane glam, but once you swap out the platform glitter boots for flat leather sandals, much of the female characters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fashion is loose and comfortable and practical. After all, it was invented by women who travelled the world and lived out of suitcases. The Daisy Jones look was also all over last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Coachella festival: cowboy boots are hereby declared the new flower crowns, and fringed suede jackets have taken over from hoodies as the after-dark throw on. Too often, summer fashion tries to divide women into two camps. Either you are a Bombshell in something tight and glittery that shows sideboob, or you are a sensible linen-wearing Mum in safe florals. But with a gauzy blouse, or a halterneck beach dress that grazes the sand, or a beaten-up denim jacket \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you get a bit of romance, without looking too done. Guitar case optional.

Mind you, that could soon be about to change due in no small part to the growing popularity of what has become Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature white grape, assyrtiko. It first took off on the island of Santorini, but the grape is now being planted all over the country, in areas such as the Atalanti Valley in Central Greece and in Macedonia. Happily, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brilliant pairing with all things Greek, including the ubiquitous Greek salad, and goes equally well with seafood from anywhere. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the good news. The bad news is that assyrtiko has got progressively more expensive in recent years, especially examples from Santorini itself, where the growing conditions are exceptionally challenging, from the volcanic soil (the island was ripped apart by a devastating eruption back in 1600BC) to the lack of rain: Santorini gets a fraction of the mainland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rainfall and instead relies on the moisture from the heavy mist that falls nightly over the island. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also subject to violent winds, which accounts for the unique way the vines are trained, coiled around like a woven basket. While the stems are cut back from time to time, the root systems can date back hundreds of years: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we say old vines here, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean 40 years old,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains Yiannis Paraskevopoulous of Gaia Wines. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We mean 400.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vines are also widely spaced out due to the lack of nutrients in the soil, which contributes to exceptionally low yields and to the level of concentration and intensity that makes its wines so unique. As if that were not enough, the land available has been progressively swallowed up for development, to satisfy the demands of a booming tourist industry. No wonder grape prices now fetch \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 a kilo, compared with 85 cents back in 2010. Most Santorini assyrtikos you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come across are unoaked, which generally best expresses their character, but some, such as Gaia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wild Ferment in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick, have a proportion that is aged in oak and clay spheres. The grape is also used to make a relatively low-alcohol but intensely sweet dessert wine called vinsanto. All of which raises a question: shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you just buy cheaper versions from elsewhere in Greece, then? Well, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re good, but they really aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as good as assyrtiko from Santorini. The best parallel I can think of, from both a quality and price point of view, is chablis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which, yes, is chardonnay, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not like chardonnay from anywhere else. And, just like chablis, the best assyrtikos are very serious wines indeed, and have a real capacity to age. If you can hang on to them for that long, that is.

Mike Gallagher argued that China, under President Xi Jinping, believed in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the inevitable demise of capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and said he hoped to better understand how far British politicians of all parties shared his committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns. The goal of Beijing, Gallagher argued, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to render us subordinate, humiliated and irrelevant on the world stage and make the CCP [Chinese Communist party] the dominant global power\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and he thanked the UK for adopting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forward posture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Indo-Pacific after Britain deployed an aircraft carrier there two years ago. Gallagher was speaking alongside Haley Stevens, the China committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead Democrat. She said the US was overly reliant on the Chinese market, particularly when it came to commodities and green technology. That was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a preparedness strategy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when thinking about a conflict over Taiwan, she said. Gallagher said he believed that the world was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the window of maximum danger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a potential kinetic confrontation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a possible war \u00e2\u20ac\u201c over Taiwan, and he hoped that the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to supplying nuclear submarines to Australia would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153help prevent world war three before it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said the long-term goal of the US was to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153win the competition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with China, which he defined as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reclaiming our economic independence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Stevens said the US and China both \u00e2\u20ac\u0153want access to one another\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s markets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but the US-China trade deficit was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153egregious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Xi has accused the US of pursuing a policy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153containment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against China and has criticised what he describes as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new cold war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd mentality of the west. The Biden administration has introduced a number of policies designed to prevent China from accessing advanced technologies, such as semiconductors, whose supply chains are concentrated in the US and its allies. Gallagher suggested that the US should instead pursue a policy of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153constrainment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recognises the fact that \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to totally decouple, but we want to constrain [the CCP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] worst behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Republican, who has not been to China himself, argued against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153relentless engagement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u015330 years of experimentation with that hypothesis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had proven unsuccessful. He is leading a delegation of eight Republicans and three Democrats, who met Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, for lunch on Friday and the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a cross-party group of MPs and peers concerned about Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising assertiveness and treatment of its Uyghur minority. Concern at the rise of China is a rare issue of bipartisan consensus in the US, although some European lobbyists argue that the rhetoric of a civilisation clash is provocative and risks inching the two sides closer to a new cold war."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/19/dance-corps-extremes-high-wire", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe first feeling is fear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: the daredevil group bringing ropewalking and climbing to the theatre", "lead": "It started with a tightrope walk over the Seine: now Rachid Ouramdane has coaxed highliner Nathan Paulin and free climber Nina Caprez into sharing their high-adrenaline experiences and unique relationship to the elements", "author": "Lyndsey Winship", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T13:00:28Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035791", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6be1c7d3b5c220873702d96436e1f76083c18ae6/0_311_4657_2794/500.jpg", "body": "You can look the video up online: a man balancing on an inch-wide rope, carefully putting one foot in front of another. He is 70 metres above the ground, behind him is the vast Eiffel Tower, below him the River Seine. From a distance, the speck of him fades into the cityscape. This is Nathan Paulin. He is a French highliner, another term for a tightrope walker, except that Paulin uses a slackline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the name is fairly self-explanatory \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never been near a circus. Paulin is usually to be found rigging his slackline between two mountains in the Alps, or walking a record-breaking 2.2km, 100m in the air, to the island of Mont Saint Michel off the Normandy coast, wind whirling around him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The first feeling is always fear,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Paulin, 29, talking of the moment he steps out on the line. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But after the first few steps I start to feel comfortable. When I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on the line, I feel more sensitive about everything. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a spectator but I feel like I belong to the environment. I can hear everything around me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The destination for the Eiffel Tower walk was the Th\u00c3\u00a9\u00c3\u00a2tre National de Chaillot, Paris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dedicated dance theatre on the north bank of the river, where choreographer Rachid Ouramdane is artistic director. Ouramdane lives between Paris and the French Alps, where he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surrounded by people who spend their time mountaineering and paragliding. He had noticed the way they talked about scaling up or jumping off mountains, not just in terms of seeking an adrenaline rush. Rather \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it revealed a kind of deep philosophy, a way to connect to nature, an incredible awareness of the living world around them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That was something Ouramdane wanted to explore as an artist. First by inviting Paulin to walk across the Seine, then trying to translate what he does to inside the theatre, along with eight acrobats from Compagnie XY and the Swiss free climber Nina Caprez in a performance called Corps Extr\u00c3\u00aames, which Ouramdane calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153halfway between a documentary and an art piece\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The piece arrives at Sadler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wells on 23 May for a two-night run. Caprez, 36, has already chronicled many of her climbs, on film (the documentaries Swissway to Heaven and WoG\u00c3\u00bc) and on her blog. There is jaw-dropping footage of her climbing in the Alps and elsewhere, scaling seemingly sheer cliffsides, fingers and toes finding invisible holds, conquering overhanging rocks, laughing, falling, swearing and triumphantly pulling her way to the summit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since I love sharing my climbing experience with a large audience, I was really keen to join the project, even though I had no idea what the outcome would be,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Caprez. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was just trusting Rachid. I had no idea who he was but I found him really funny, he had a really good way with people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She and Paulin didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what they were getting themselves into. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was totally new to me that environment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Caprez says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never work in a group, really, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m mostly hanging alone on my wall. Often Nathan and I were just watching, like: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOK, what the hell are we doing here?!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For Paulin, used to standing alone in the sky in vast open landscapes, being inside the studio \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was like being a bird in a cage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he says. Out of their natural habitat, gradually Paulin and Caprez came to make sense of the theatre, especially once the audience arrived. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now I really get it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Caprez. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just people watching a video at home, but being in this room, feeling the vibes. This is what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m most excited about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paulin agrees: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no way to cheat. We have Instagram and all these videos where you can make people think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing something crazy just because you film it this way or that way. Here you are for an hour on stage with 1,000 people watching you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The physical risk might not be as great as, say, free climbing El Capitan, but the stakes are raised in a different way. Caprez has also picked up some new skills as an acrobat. She and the performers from Compagnie XY climb, hang, jump and fall, throw and catch each other and balance precariously. The set for the show began with a single slackline high above the stage, and a blank, flat, white climbing wall. Then the team went to the Gorges du Verdon in the south of France, and filmed Carpez climbing and Paulin highlining so that the images could be projected on to the stage. The audience too will be able to get up close with the texture of the rock and the awesomeness of the landscape, while they hear the performers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 thoughts in voiceover. It is thrilling to get even a small sense of what Caprez and Paulin experience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once I touch the rock there are no more thoughts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Caprez. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no consciousness about anything, but everything is there. Your sensitivity is so high that actually you can do incredible things.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Any average person would be terrified, looking down at a few hundred metres\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 drop, but Caprez says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel fear, I feel excited, and this excitement really guides me to a high level of awareness and I totally live in the present. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t project myself to the past or the future. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see myself climbing the top. The only thing that counts is metre by metre, step by step, pitch by pitch. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very special state of mind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Caprez has written about when her daughter was born with a heart defect and had to have surgery at a few months old. The only thing she could think to do to keep her sanity while they waited for news on her four-hour surgery was to go climbing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was the hardest experience of my life and climbing then was more like an escape,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153because no matter what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in my life I can turn off my brain. It makes me think positive; it gives me power.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The surgery was a success and her daughter is now fine. You must feel powerful out on the highline, too, I say to Paulin, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re defying what seems possible, putting physics on hold. Sure, he says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but I also feel so small. You feel that you are nothing. Sometimes you feel you are doing something hard and you are mastering it, you are able to deal with the line moving and the wind, but at the same time you are just dealing with the elements, you are not the master. You are just a little guy walking on the line. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I really like to feel things,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he adds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of my best memories on the highlines were when it was windy and rainy and I can feel more. You can feel it with your skin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ouramdane brings up a quote he heard recently: that we teach people to appreciate literature and maths, but not the rain on our faces. Paulin has found a way to embrace that lesson. So the extreme body of the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s title is less about the cast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s formidable acrobatic feats, more about the superpowers of our senses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a choreography of awareness,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ouramdane. He refers to the apocryphal idea of the Inuit having 100 words for snow. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you speak with Nathan or Nina they start to make visible nuances you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t usually perceive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remember when we were shooting, Nina said we should go fast because soon the texture of the rocks will be different. She knows the rhythm of the day, and the fact the rocks will change after a certain time of being in the sun, even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same rock.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is definitely a message in Corps Extr\u00c3\u00aames about how out of tune we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve become with our environment, how we can only survive by working with nature, not against it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we try to touch on is the vulnerability of those people being in a place that is not normal for a human.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Or rather, from a distance it looks like vulnerability, but because they can activate this hyper-awareness of their surroundings, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you realise their fragility is not a weakness,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ouramdane. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But it could become a strength when you know how to use it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Corps Extr\u00c3\u00aames is at Sadler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wells, London, 23 &amp; 24 May."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/may/19/energy-bills-could-fall-to-average-of-2053-as-ofgem-prepares-to-lower-cap", "primaryCategory": "money", "title": "Energy bills could fall to average of \u00c2\u00a32,053 as Ofgem prepares to lower cap", "lead": "But campaigners say it will not give much relief to struggling households as government support ends", "author": "Jillian Ambrose Energy correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T12:55:52Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035794", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/608b9b417f0b1d827b8d2364e81760749e97c15e/0_0_2843_1705/500.jpg", "body": "Household energy bills could fall to an average of \u00c2\u00a32,053 a year this summer as the regulator prepares to lower its cap on energy prices next week, according to analysts. However, campaigners have warned that the lower cap on energy bills, to be announced on Thursday, is unlikely to provide much relief to households that struggled to pay their bills over the winter because the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support schemes have come to an end. Households should also expect their energy bills to remain stubbornly high through the coming winter, at almost double the rates paid in 2020, and remain above pre-pandemic levels for the rest of the decade, according to analysts at Cornwall Insight. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy price guarantee capped gas and electricity bills at an average of \u00c2\u00a32,500 for a typical household from October last year. Energy bill payers also received a \u00c2\u00a3400 rebate spread over six months from October, which helped reduce costs further. From July this year the standard energy tariffs used by 27 million households will once again be decided by a cap calculated by Ofgem, the energy regulator for Great Britain, which is based on the cost of supplying energy. Cornwall Insight has predicted that Ofgem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cap will fall by more than \u00c2\u00a31,000 from \u00c2\u00a33,280 for the three months from April \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when households were still protected by the government scheme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to \u00c2\u00a32,053 from July to reflect the tumbling cost of gas in the global wholesale markets. The price cap is expected to remain at similar levels next winter, too, according to Cornwall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysts. They have predicted that the cap will dip slightly to \u00c2\u00a31,975 for the three months from October before rising again to reach almost \u00c2\u00a32,045 for the first quarter of next year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the cap falling from the sky-high prices of the past two years, the figure remains over \u00c2\u00a31,000 per year more than the price cap levels seen prior to the pandemic,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cornwall Insight said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do not currently expect bills to return to pre-2020 levels before the end of the decade at the earliest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Campaigners from the End Fuel Poverty Coalition have warned that households hoping for a sharp drop in their bills may find little difference compared with the rates they paid over winter. Simon Francis, a coordinator at the coalition, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People now face many more months with bills remaining stubbornly high. This will see them continue to use up their savings for everyday items, run up credit card bills, fall into debt with energy firms or turn to food banks as the cost of living crisis deepens.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/19/hungary-steps-up-threat-to-block-eu-weapons-aid-for-ukraine-peter-szijjarto", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Hungary steps up threat to block EU weapons aid for Ukraine", "lead": "Foreign minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments at odds with unity G7 nations want to project at summit in Hiroshima", "author": "Jennifer Rankin in Brussels", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T12:40:28Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035799", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a8a64d75fca96404e980393d2cb301071d6a441c/0_185_2879_1727/500.jpg", "body": "Hungary has stepped up threats to block further EU funds for weapons to aid Ukraine, marring a show of unity from western nations at the G7 summit. The Hungarian foreign minister, P\u00c3\u00a9ter Szijj\u00c3\u00a1rt\u00c3\u00b3, has said his government will block a further \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500m from the European peace facility, a fund used to reimburse EU member states that supply military aid to Ukraine, unless Kyiv removes Hungary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OTP Bank from its list of war sponsors. Speaking on Thursday, Szijj\u00c3\u00a1rt\u00c3\u00b3 also said the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest Russia sanctions plan was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully contrary to common sense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the previous 10 had failed, according to a report on a Hungarian government website. EU diplomats say Hungary has threatened to veto the 11th package of sanctions over OTP Bank, a move Budapest has often threatened but never carried out. The comments contrast with the show of unity the richest industrial nations want to project at the G7 summit in Hiroshima, where the US and UK have announced further sanctions against Russia. Hungary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threats are likely to overshadow a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday and the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing talks on its latest Russia sanctions. Hungary has claimed it is blocking the latest tranche of European peace facility funds because the initiative was designed to enhance Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global security and was not to be used exclusively in Ukraine. One senior EU diplomat said that argument was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bit disingenuous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The timing is miserable because Ukraine is on the eve of a large offensive to try to push back the Russian aggression. It does make me wonder if there is not a much more narrow economic interest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Budapest has also drawn a link with Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s addition of Hungary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OTP Bank to its international sponsors of war list, a group that includes five Greek companies, four Chinese, four French, three US and one British one entity. While EU diplomats are irritated by Hungary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s linkage of the issues, there is also frustration with Kyiv. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ukraine should always ask itself: do our actions help us or does it make stuff more difficult?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the EU diplomat said, adding that it was still the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrong approach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Hungary. The European peace facility was set up in 2021 to help the EU prevent conflicts and bolster security around the world. Since the Russian invasion in February 2022, the EU has agreed to spend \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.6bn (\u00c2\u00a34bn) on military aid for Ukraine via the facility, a historic decision to fund weapons for a country at war. Under the scheme, EU member states ask to be reimbursed for weapons, ammunition and other military aid they send to Ukraine. A second senior diplomat downplayed the consequences of the Hungarian threat, saying it would not have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a real impact on real life\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nor change the volume of deliveries to Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some things are reimbursed and others are not,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the person said. Hungary has refused to supply any military equipment to Ukraine and has railed against EU sanctions against Russia, while so far never blocking either release of the funds or any overall sanctions package.

The dialogue, especially at the start, is minimal, and skates on the surface of deeper felt emotions between Ennis (Lucas Hedges) and Jack (Mike Faist), the Wyoming sheepherders who meet, aged 19, and become furtive lovers for the next 20 years. Nica Burns\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new theatre is proving itself as a space in which acoustics are central to the action and Dan Gillespie Sells\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 country and western songs, led by Eddi Reader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beautiful vocals, build the atmosphere and charge. In Jonathan Butterell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production, the music becomes its own language, even between the lovers who connect through song. Although there is a conspicuous yee-haa twang to it all, with Tom Pye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set made of scrubland, tent and glowing campfire and his costumes featuring suede, spurs and Stetsons, it manages not to sink into cliche. The story begins in 1963 in a state so homophobic it was life-threatening to be openly gay. Hedges and Faist take some time to warm up: they have the look of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch models, topless in denims and suede boots, and the sexual interest is initially delivered in coy, cursory glances. The passion never really burns up the stage but their chemistry comes alive as boyish romance, with play fighting and suddenly grabbing ardour. It retains an innocence and tenderness all the way through, even in spite of the unspoken dissatisfaction they come to feel, and both actors are compelling, Faist especially so as the ebullient Jack, while Hedges is more melancholic as Ennis, too scared to risk a fuller life with Jack, and full of regret for it. Staged as a memory play, it features an older Ennis (Paul Hickey), as grizzled as he is at the start of Proulx\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story. This is the play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only dud note, the older figure is too evidently a device and spare part. Then there is Ennis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, Alma (Emily Fairn), who captures the impact of closeted male homosexuality on the women caught within its doubleness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not no queer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ennis, Jack quickly echoing him, and we see how the denials are necessary for survival, in their time. Yet still we cannot consign their story to the past at a moment in America in which the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say gay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bill is gaining traction. The play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ending is stark, leaving our sobs stuck, dry, in our throats.

She died of cancer at the age of 62 in 2016.

In a move that unions say will diminish security at points of entry to the UK, members of the armed forces will be given five days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 training before checking passports at Heathrow, Gatwick and Dover. Once deployed, the temporary staff in uniform will not have the powers to detain suspected drug dealers, terrorists or victims of trafficking, and will instead have to ask a fully trained Border Force staff member to do that. The training, truncated to five days from three weeks given to Border Force guards, will begin as two unions consider strike action over pay and conditions. The training follows the deployment of more than 600 soldiers, RAF staff and Royal Navy staff during strikes over the Christmas period. Soldiers in uniform worked at Gatwick, Heathrow, Birmingham, Cardiff, Manchester and Glasgow airports during the Christmas strikes. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) and Immigration Service Union (ISU), which both represent Border Force guards, are considering strike action over the summer months. Union leaders have condemned the retraining of the armed forces as a risk to security. Lucy Moreton, the professional officer at the ISU, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is wasting yet more public money training military staff who cannot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c through no fault of their own \u00e2\u20ac\u201c provide even a fraction of the national security cover a border officer can.

The country would be better served by a government that paid civil servants a decent wage to be civil servants, instead of treating them worse than any other public servant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ISU ran a ballot for industrial action up to 16 May, the results of which have not yet been disclosed. The PSC union is considering further industrial action after calling for a pay rise, better pensions and no cuts to redundancy terms.

There was chaos at Dover over Easter that led to delays of up to 20 hours for passengers. Security guards at Heathrow airport have been striking throughout May in a dispute over pay. About 1,400 staff represented by Unite based at Terminal 5 and in campus security have already staged five days of strikes this month, and will also strike from Thursday 25 May though to Saturday 27 May. British Airways, the only airline that operates from Terminal 5, cancelled more than 300 flights in response to strikes over Easter. Documents leaked to the Guardian in December showed that people suspected of crimes such as carrying a false passport, drug smuggling, people-trafficking and victims of modern slavery cannot be stopped by members of the armed forces if they hold valid travel documents. Instead, a separate intervention has to be sought for suspected serious criminals or their victims from a fully trained Border Force officer. In December, just nine people were stopped at passport control and held at Heathrow over three strike days from 23 to 25 December, compared with 189 people over the same three days in 2021, a 95% drop. During the winter strikes by Border Force officers, there were few delays for passengers as hundreds of military personnel and civil servants were brought in to cover striking workers. Many passengers cleared passport control in less than five minutes. A Home Office spokesperson has said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our priority is to keep our citizens safe and our borders secure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are working closely with all UK ports and airports to ensure we have robust plans in place to minimise any delays if strike action goes ahead.

She is about to embark on her first European tour, together with bass player Natalya Seryakova and drummer and backing singer Anastasiya Khomenko. The trio play on Saturday in Kyiv, in an emotionally charged benefit concert to raise money for anti-drone weapons. There are gigs in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as London, Manchester, Bristol and Brighton in June. The women describe their sound as a cross between thrash metal and punk. Critics have praised Navrotskaya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barbed-wire howl\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a face-toasting listen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We joke that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fem-dom. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s music that can kick ass,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Seryakova said. The band released its debut album in February, a year after Russian tanks and armoured columns began trundling towards Kyiv. They have a growing number of fans and a deal with the London label New Heavy Sounds. Navrotskaya stayed in Kyiv when Russia launched its full-scale attack. Seryakova went to Adelaide in Australia after being offered a job as a sound director. Khomenko left for Barcelona with her eight-year-old son. On Thursday the band was reunited for the first time since 2022. They rehearsed in a studio in the Ukrainian capital, hit twice this week by multiple Russian missiles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the bass from next door,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Seryakova said, after a sudden loud boom. Up close, their music is fast, furious and extremely loud. The band members hugged each other between songs; Navrotskaya wiping away tears. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are incredibly excited and happy because we will get together to knock out all the shit that has accumulated during this time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the band posted on their Instagram page. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We missed each other. And now we are hungry for live performances and sharing our crazy energy with you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The war has proved an important moment for Ukrainian art. Ukrainian poets and novelists are being translated into English and reaching an international audience. Most Ukrainian rock groups are unable to tour abroad, because of a ban on men of military age from leaving the country. The members of Death Pill see themselves as heavy metal ambassadors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Russia is trying to destroy our culture. This has been going on for 300 years. We want to spread news about the war and our resistance to imperialism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Khomenko said. Both Navrotskya and Seryakova have parents who were born in Russia and settled in Ukraine several decades ago. Seryakova grew up speaking Russian in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia. Her father Serhii has joined Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armed forces and is on the frontline in the east. Her mother is a senior civil servant. The family passionately supports Ukraine. Navrotskaya spent her childhood in Irpin, a town in the Kyiv region occupied last spring by Russian troops. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My soul is Ukrainian,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Two of Death Pill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s songs including Ebalo were originally sung in the Russian language. The band has now changed them into English after a backlash on Facebook and has added other tracks in Ukrainian. Ukrainians are bilingual. The band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition reflects an uncompromising national mood following the horrors last year of Bucha and Mariupol. Russian is still widely spoken in Ukraine, especially in the south and east. But increasingly it is seen as the language of the occupier. The musicians turned up to band practice this week wearing vyshyvankas, traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirts and dresses. They condemned attempts by well-meaning western organisers to promote \u00e2\u20ac\u0153peace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by bringing Russians and Ukrainians together at festivals and literary events. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Would we appear on the same stage as a Russian band? Fuck no,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Seryakova said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At school I had to read Dostoyevsky. Why? We need to cancel Russian literature and to promote our own Ukrainian culture.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The band formed in 2016. One inspiration was the underground feminist punk movement riot grrrl, from which the Russian group Pussy Riot took its name. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my opinion Pussy Riot is not a music band,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Seryakova said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are about politics and performance. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually play. For us it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about the music.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The war, inevitably, has shaped the band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s songwriting. One new track is called Death to Traitors; another is Die for Vietnam. Ged Murphy of New Heavy Sounds hailed the band as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special group of women\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were blown away. I felt the same frisson of excitement as I felt when I heard White Riot by the Clash back in the day, but angrier, heavier and so \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fierce, full-on punk rock, with a bit of thrash metal thrown in and chock-a-block with feminist fury, and played brilliantly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Their songs were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153abrasive and gnarly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153melodies and hooks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Murphy added. All three members of Death Pill said they felt happy when they played together in the same venue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that was impossible when they were continents apart. It was a chance to release the trauma and stress brought on by war, and an opportunity to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fuck the system and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have more followers in Europe and the US these days than in Ukraine. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know: maybe this is because they want to support us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Khomenko said. She added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Being Ukrainian is very cool these days.

Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez told the UN committee on the elimination of discrimination against women: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon be unveiling an app that will allow people to log the household chores that different members of the family perform so we can see how many hours of work we each spend on housework and thus reorder the time we spend doing that housework.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said the new app, whose development budget is reported to be \u00e2\u201a\u00ac211,750 (\u00c2\u00a3184,000), was designed to ensure that every family member pulled their weight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think this is an exercise that could be used at home to share the chores out between sons, daughter, fathers, mothers, or between flatmates or life partners, because the division of those tasks is sometimes unequal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez said the app would also serve to highlight all the invisible jobs necessary for the smooth running of a house. Although tidying up the kitchen might take 20 minutes, she said, it depended on someone having remembered to buy washing-up liquid or having planned the shopping list. She later responded to critics of the plan in a tweet, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ah, privileges. What those who are annoyed by the chore-sharing app are really annoyed about is the possibility of having to start doing their bit at home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The app is part of the equality ministry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shared responsibilities plan, a series of public policies intended to improve equality between men and women. The ministry said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The challenge lies in designing comprehensive care systems from a gender, intersectional and human rights perspective that promote shared responsibility between men and women, the state, the market, families and the community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A survey last year by Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Statistics Institute revealed that 45.9% of women performed the majority of domestic chores, compared with just 14.7% of men."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/19/dear-billy-review-traverse-edinburgh-the-big-yin-connolly", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Dear Billy review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c brilliant tribute to the Big Yin", "lead": "Gary McNair delivers verbatim interviews and misremembered Connolly routines from ordinary people in this love letter", "author": "Mark Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T11:39:07Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035832", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a8cc949808f90467d163495806cdd4ca08132dc7/0_175_5282_3170/500.jpg", "body": "There is an air of Nick Park\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Creature Comforts about Gary McNair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153love letter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Billy Connolly. The performer builds his joyful one-man show from interviews with ordinary people about what they think of the shipyard welder turned national treasure. He recalls as many as 50 of them, each delivered with careful attention to the pauses, mistakes and digressions of everyday speech. He shows us people losing the thread, mixing up their words or going on surreal flights of fancy. Ask a stranger about Connolly and you will, it seems, be told about sheep thrown into the sea, the pleasure of Flumps and something about the Wombles. Like Park\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s animation, which put human voices into the mouths of clay animals, Dear Billy delights in the quirks of conversation. There is tremendous fun in that, but McNair goes so much further. Joined on the carpeted stage by musicians Jill O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Sullivan and Simon Liddell, creating a superb acoustic soundtrack, he weaves his source material into a democratic tapestry with Connolly as its guiding spirit. McNair used a similar technique in Locker Room Talk, his 2017 response to Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grab them by the pussy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd remarks, in which he quizzed men about their attitudes to women. Dear Billy has none of that darkness, but in its collage of voices, it presents an equally rich picture of a nation. In an expertly modulated performance directed by Joe Douglas for the National Theatre of Scotland, he groups his material thematically, taking us chronologically through Connolly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life as narrated by those who once met him, half-knew him, heard something about him or misremember a routine. Their stories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reliable or otherwise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c present Connolly as a messiah and an ordinary Joe, a lifesaver and a charlatan. The affection for Connolly is unmistakable, but Dear Billy is as much a love letter to the people. In this telling, Connolly is more symbol than human being; less a man than a mirror and an inspiration. Naturally, McNair weaves in his own tale of meeting the Big Yin, adding to the impression of a secular god who is at once charismatic and one of us. The cumulative effect is vivid, funny and poignant. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At the Traverse, Edinburgh, until 20 May.

But that did not stop Ann Widdecombe landing herself in a pickle on Tuesday by suggesting people who could not afford cheese sandwiches should simply forgo them. Reacting to BBC analysis that the price of a cheese sandwich had risen more than a third in a year, the former Tory minister said people should not have cheese sandwiches if they could not afford the ingredients. So how has the lunchtime staple changed with inflation? The Guardian has analysed figures from the retail research firm Assosia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which tracks prices across the big four supermarkets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as official inflation data from the ONS, to find out how much four forms of cheese sandwich have been affected. The no-nonsense snack (up 23%) The bread and butter of cheese sandwiches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in this case, literally: two slices of own-brand white bread, cheddar cheese and butter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is much more expensive than it was just a year ago. The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis of Assosia figures puts the cost of one sandwich at 40p \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up 23% from last May (separate ONS figures show an inflation rate of 35% in the year to March, suggesting inflation could be starting to fall). Rising prices have hit dairy products hard. They are relatively energy-intensive to produce, and farmers have seen rising costs for animal feed and fertiliser thanks to rising energy prices caused by the war in Ukraine. Last summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drought also dried up grazing land, which further increased prices. Because of its popularity, milk has historically been sold with very low profit margins, meaning rising costs for producers will be directly passed on to consumers. Cheddar cheese \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which requires a lengthy chilling period to allow it to mature \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is further affected by surging energy costs. The ploughman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (up 17%) Upgrading your sandwich to a ploughman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (we opted for red leicester, butter and Branston pickle in Hovis medium white bread) will set you back 52p \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 17% more than in May last year, when it cost 45p. The average price of bread has rocketed, driven by a combination of an increase in grain prices after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine, rising domestic energy costs and high fertiliser prices for UK-based producers. Other ingredients are also on the rise: Assosia figures show own-brand red leicester is up 25.2%, unsalted butter up 5% and Branston pickle is 10.6% more expensive than last year. The Italian (up 38.3%) A classic Italian caprese sandwich is a tempting lunchtime treat as the weather gets warmer. Use two slices of seeded bread, brush them with olive oil and fill with sliced mozzarella, tomato, and basil \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 bellissimo! The price, not so much: you can expect to pay 92p for every sandwich \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up a whopping 38.3% since last year. Again, the increase is driven by key ingredients becoming much, much pricier. Own-brand extra virgin olive oil has seen dramatic price rises of 55.6%. Spain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest producer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c produced half its normal quantity in the last year, and extreme drought exacerbated by global heating means harvests are expected to remain poor. The rise in tomato prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c own-brand salad tomatoes are up 25.9% according to Assosia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is partly down to the cost of heating greenhouses, and follows on from salad shortages earlier this year (which led the minister with responsibility for food, Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se Coffey, to advise British people to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cherish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd turnips). The bougie brie baguette (up 19.2%) Widdecombe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheese comment led the presenter Vanessa Feltz to compare her to Marie Antoinette. But had she truly been channelling the French queen, Widdecombe would surely have suggested British people turn to a brie and cranberry baguette instead. Our analysis of Assosia figures show that the indulgent crusty and cheesy snack would have cost 89p last year, rising 19.2% to \u00c2\u00a31.06 this year. The big driver here is the cranberry sauce, the price of which has skyrocketed. Most cranberries are imported from the US, Canada and Chile, and US Department of Agriculture figures show cranberry production fell every year between 2018 and 2021 (the latest year for which figures are available). Meanwhile, own-brand brie is up 29.9%."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/may/19/its-come-at-the-right-time-why-fashion-prizes-have-become-the-holy-grail-for-struggling-young-designers", "primaryCategory": "global", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s come at the right time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: why fashion prizes have become the holy grail for struggling young designers", "lead": "Getting a burgeoning brand on the runway has never been harder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but could contests putting industry connections on par with prize money make a difference?", "author": "Chloe Mac Donnell", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T11:30:26Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035839", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cf764a42a89e6b70a55d2ef3d8dc4d5d334ed053/0_236_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "As a new designer, how do you attract the fashion world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention?

Breaking into \u00c2\u00a32tn global fashion industry has never been easy, but recently things have become even tougher. Many fashion graduates leave university burdened with debt (the fees for studying for a BA in fashion design at London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Central Saint Martins cost more than \u00c2\u00a39k per annum for UK students). Internships \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the standard way of gaining experience in the industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are regularly unpaid or pay minimum wage, while the majority of jobs are based in the capital where average rent prices recently hit a record high of \u00c2\u00a32,210 per property per month. Following the global pandemic, the ongoing economic crisis and Brexit, the British Fashion Council called on the government for support, highlighting that much of the above-average growth made by the UK in the past 10 years could easily be wiped out. Even some established designers work from one collection to the next, relying on sponsorship from even bigger brands. Last year, Matty Bovan received financial backing from Dolce &amp; Gabbana, while Richard Quinn was supported by the credit score company Clearpay. Sometimes this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough, though, and hotly tipped designers such as Sibling are forced into voluntarily liquidation. However, there is another path that many designers take in the hope of catapulting themselves to success: entering a competition. Two elements make contests attractive. Firstly, they offer the chance for designers to gain some serious capital to get their brand off the (bedroom) floor. And, secondly, contests can help get their names out into the industry, giving them the opportunity to widen their network. One of the most established awards for rising stars in the industry is the International Woolmark prize. The competition was founded in Paris more than 80 years ago, where it was won by a then-unknown designer called Valentino Garavani, founder of his namesake brand Valentino. In subsequent years, Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld have scooped first place. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So much of what is inaccessible for young designers is just being in the room,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sin\u00c3\u00a9ad Burke, a disability activist, Vogue cover star and judge on the Woolmark panel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This process gives access to those key industry professionals and the finalists are able to build relationships with them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Surprisingly for an industry that prides itself on exclusivity, open contests that level the playing field have been widely welcomed by its gatekeepers. In addition to the Woolmark prize, in France there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the Andam prize (Martin Margiela is a previous winner) and the LVMH prize (Jacquemus won it in 2015). In the UK, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design that first launched in 2018. On Thursday, King Charles presented the award to Foday Dumbuya, founder and creative director of Labrum London. The king remarked on the vital support that the British Fashion Council provides to new designers; in the last financial year it delivered over \u00c2\u00a31.2m in funds to designers and scholars. One of its funds, the BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund was won most recently by the cult womenswear label 16Arlington. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prizes are vital for independent businesses like ours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says 16Arlington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marco Capaldo, who received a \u00c2\u00a3150,000 cash prize. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They offer us the chance to expand our business and look to future growth as well as providing the most incredible platform for the brand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On Tuesday, six months after being whittled down from more than 100 to just eight finalists, the winners of the 2023 Woolmark prize were revealed at a ceremony at the Petit Palais. Lagos Space Programme, a Nigerian-based brand founded by Adeju Thompson that aims to shift common perceptions of African fashion won, while another prize \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Karl Lagerfeld award for innovation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c went to the Danish brand A Roege Hove, whose form-fitting and cut-out pieces subvert traditional knitwear designs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just happy. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m speechless,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Thompson (who uses they/them pronouns), as they posed for the press with their trophy. They received $200,000 Australian dollars (just over \u00c2\u00a3100k in British pounds) while Denmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Amalie R\u00c3\u00b8ge was awarded AU $100,000 (around \u00c2\u00a353,000). Thompson said the award was particularly meaningful to them, because there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any kind of sponsorship for designers in Nigeria. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You truly are independent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they said, adding that their team of six also worked without a consistent supply of electricity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Due to rampant government corruption and [other factors], a lot of people that would have been considered national treasures have been forgotten. Lagos Space Programme does elevate voices and supports people financially, and this is also a win for them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they said. With a government fuel subsidy being lifted next month, Thompson plans to use some of the prize fund to invest in a solar panel rather than relying on the national grid. Last November, each Woolmark prize finalist was given AU $60,000 (\u00c2\u00a332,000) and tasked with creating six pieces using merino wool. To help them achieve this, they were also given access to a panel of fashion experts spanning everything from supply chain to the commercial buying process and e-commerce styling. Unlike other competitions where a standalone collection is required, the Woolmark prize lets entrants use the pieces as part of their regular seasonal showcase. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It means it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cost us anything to enter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says finalist Robyn Lynch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I showed some of my entry pieces as part of my autumn/winter 2023 collection in February.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea is that, as a finalist, you have education resources, a supplier network and a financial structure to help you build the collection you are going to enter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Burke explains. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It makes the assessment more equitable because some brands competing are bigger than others.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The eight finalist collections were then judged by a panel that included Ala\u00c3\u00afa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creative director, Pieter Mulier; Alessandro Sartori, artistic director of Zegna; Francesco Risso, creative director of Marni; and the photographer Tyler Mitchell. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a moment that will change the designer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sartori. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just about the money, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all the media exposure that comes with it, and the industry support is a game changer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The mentorship is priceless,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says R\u00c3\u00b8ge who, through the scheme, began working with a new factory and a yarn mill, and discovered a new stockist in China. R\u00c3\u00b8ge plans on spending her prize fund on a digital printing machine. For those who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win, getting access to Woolmark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global supply chain to create their entries still helped to propel their brands forward. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Factories tend to have a minimum sample fabric order of 500 to 1,000 metres,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains Lynch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would typically need just 10 metres, so we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t normally even get a reply.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With restrictions lifted, Lynch was able to access a wide range of technical fabrics that further pushed her creativity. She hopes to continue using these suppliers. For Thompson, who references designers including Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo and worked with suppliers in Japan, the prize couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have come at a better time. Gearing up to make their Paris fashion week debut in June, they say it allows them to focus on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a proper debut\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while also attracting more viewers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fashion is tough,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Thompson, who founded Lagos Space Programme in 2014. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you are first finding your voice, there is so much self doubt. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to just go and work for a brand. However, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve really worked on fine-tuning my message. As a queer person from Nigeria, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very important to communicate who I am. Winning this feels like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s come at the right time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you want to read the complete version of this newsletter please subscribe to receive Fashion Statement in your inbox every Thursday."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/may/19/un-denied-access-to-rohingya-refugee-camps-after-cyclone-mocha-myanmar", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "title": "UN denied access to Rohingya refugee camps after Cyclone Mocha", "lead": "UNHCR says Myanmar government has refused to allow it to distribute health supplies in Sittwe, where an estimated 90% of Rohingya homes have been destroyed", "author": "Aung Naing Soe and Kaamil Ahmed", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T11:29:59Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035842", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c5eb6967fc48087b9d960bfbbf38949eb0d12826/0_172_6048_3627/500.jpg", "body": "UN staff say they have been denied access to help thousands of Rohingya living in displacement camps in Myanmar who are in urgent need of food, medicine and shelter in the aftermath of Cyclone Mocha, which struck the west of the country on Sunday. People living in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine state, said they estimated that about 90% of homes of Rohingya people had been destroyed and more than 100 people killed when winds of more than 150 miles an hour hit the region. However, the refugee agency UNHCR said the Myanmar government has refused access to the camps in Sittwe, home to about 100,000 people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As yet, UNHCR has not been granted access to carry out needs assessments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bright Islam, a 28-year-old Rohingya activist, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cyclone destroyed everything we had. We have nothing to eat, and people have to sleep on the road. Injured people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access to medical treatment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said he witnessed people drown in the flood water in Sittwe, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mostly children and older people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and counted about 110 dead bodies when the waters cleared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I cried because I was afraid, I could also be dead,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Habibullah, who only wanted to be known by one name, said his 55-year-old aunt died in the storm because she was too scared to leave her home in Dar Paing camp in Sittwe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect that it would be that bad,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. He said he had to leave her in her house while he helped others. After the cyclone, he found her body. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am very sorry to leave her there. But I had no other choice. If we had early warning and precaution in time, she would still be alive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cyclone Mocha hit Myanmar on its journey across the Bay of Bengal. Sittwe was the worst affected area, but the category 5 storm also damaged towns further east in Chin, Sagaing and Magway regions. The UN said on Thursday that 17 townships in Rakhine and four in Chin had been declared natural-disaster-affected areas by the government. Images on social media show trees, buildings, and electricity poles toppled, and debris piled on the ground. The UN said health supplies and water purification tablets for 200,000 people have been sent to Sittwe. On Tuesday, Ramanathan Balakrishnan, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Myanmar, said 5.4 million people were thought to live in the cyclone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s path. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of these, we consider 3.1 million people to be most vulnerable to cyclone impacts by taking together indicators of shelter quality, food insecurity and poor coping capacity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It really is a nightmare scenario for this cyclone to hit areas with such deep pre-existing needs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Balakrishnan said. The Rohingya live in internal displacement camps after being forced from their homes in Myanmar by numerous military attacks since the 1970s. A military \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 2017 pushed a million Rohingya to seek refuge in Bangladesh. Reuben Lim, the chief communications officer for UNHCR Myanmar, confirmed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deaths by drowning have been reported in displacement camps with many others missing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ro Nay San Lwin, a Rohingya activist in Europe, said he expected high casualties. He said early warning announcements of the cyclone made by the military through loudspeakers in the camps were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just for show\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as no logistical support, shelters or transport, were provided and Rohingya were not allowed to leave the camps. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People lost their lives because they had no freedom of movement. The junta has been committing serious international crimes against the Rohingya for many decades. Their aim is to eliminate the entire population from the country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Islam said they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153living in hell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We got more affected by the cyclone because our camp is close to the sea and our movement is under control,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we could stay in our original homes, it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been that bad.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Bangladesh, about 60,000 people were displaced and 30,000 homes damaged or destroyed in Cox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bazar district, where more than 1 million Rohingya live in refugee camps. Rohingya Refugee Response, which coordinates humanitarian support for more than 900,000 refugees in Bangladesh, said 5,800 shelters were damaged and 400 destroyed. Health and education centres and water points were damaged by landslides. UNHCR said it has been providing emergency shelter and other services in Bangladesh. The worst conditions were on the southern-most tip of mainland Bangladesh and in the Nayapara refugee camp, where refugees who lost their homes to a fire two years ago again saw homes damaged. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our block was already burned down and so the shelters were only light plastic and bamboo,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Amir Hossain, whose shelter was damaged. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People were worried before the cyclone hit the camp. As soon as the strong winds started, most of the tarpaulin roofs were blown away and only the frames of the homes were left. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are struggling to rebuild again, we have not got the materials to rebuild the shelters. Some people are living in community centres and schools for now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Amid the destruction, seven babies were born in one of the refugee camps further north, on Sunday, according to the NGO Friendship.

His death was announced by his management agency, which posted a statement on its website saying Berger had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153passed away peacefully but unexpectedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Salzburg, the city where he grew up. Born Helmut Steinberger in the Austrian spa town of Bad Ischl in 1944, Berger studied acting in London before moving to Italy, where he met and began a relationship with acclaimed director Luchino Visconti, nearly 40 years his senior. Visconti gave him his first acting role, a small part in the comic anthology The Witches, and subsequently cast him in a spectacular role in his landmark 1969 epic The Damned. Berger played Martin von Essenbeck, a scion of a wealthy industrial family who struggle for control over the business in interwar Germany as the Nazis rise to power; for the film, Berger famously performed in drag as Marlene Dietrich and was subsequently nominated for a Golden Globe for most promising male newcomer. Berger then starred in an adaptation of Oscar Wilde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Picture of Dorian Gray, and was cast in Vittorio de Sica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1970 masterwork The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, as a member of prosperous Italian family that fall victim to the fascists during the second world war. Berger was subsequently cast in another signature role in Visconti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biopic of Bavaria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eccentric 19th-century King Ludwig II. Berger reunited again with Visconti for Conversation Piece, released in 1974, in which he starred opposite Burt Lancaster in a drama inspired by his and Visconti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship; in the same period he played one of his many playboy-gigolo characters opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Henry Fonda in Ash Wednesday, and another opposite Michael Caine and Glenda Jackson in The Romantic Englishwoman. In the Tinto Brass-directed Salon Kitty, he returned to the combination of sleaze and Nazism as an SS man who sets up a brothel for spying purposes. After Visconti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death in 1976, which precipitated a personal crisis, Berger struggled in his career, but secured a prominent role in TV series Dynasty as Fallon Carrington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleazy fiance Peter De Vilbis, who dies in a plane crash. He also had a small part as corrupt Vatican accountant Frederick Keinszig in The Godfather Part III while continuing to work in mostly European productions. Late work included the 1989 incarnation of Yves Saint Laurent in the 2014 biopic of the fashion designer directed by Bertrand Bonello, and his final role in Albert Serra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 film Libert\u00c3\u00a9, which he plays an 18th-century aristocrat who organises a night of outdoor debauchery. Aside from his relationship with Visconti, Berger, who was bisexual, was associated with numerous celebrities of the era, and married Francesca Guidato in 1994."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/19/uk-business-owners-share-your-stories-of-family-succession", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "title": "UK business owners: share your stories of family succession", "lead": "We would like to hear about your experiences of succession in family businesses.

These popular stories, with their English country garden settings and precise illustrations, have been stalwarts of British children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bookshelves over the past century. Yet the stories may not be as British as most of us assume. Dr Emily Zobel Marshall, in a new essay for The Conversation, has called for wider acknowledgment of the debt Potter owed to the Brer Rabbit stories told by enslaved Africans working on American plantations. The Brer Rabbit tales, about a cunning rabbit who lives in a briar patch and outwits larger animals, can be traced back to pre-colonial Africa, Zobel Marshall, a reader in postcolonial literature at Leeds Beckett university, explained. The tales were then shared among enslaved people in American plantations, before being adapted for white audiences in the late 19th century by the American journalist and folklorist Joel Chandler Harris. The Uncle Remus stories, as they became known, thanks to the name of Harris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fictional African American narrator, were familiar to Potter. Linda Lear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2008 biography of Potter, A Life in Nature, notes that while her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first audience was British\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, her work was strongly influenced by Harris \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whose Brer Rabbit stories she had loved as a child\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Copies of Harris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brer Rabbit folktale collections, bearing her father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bookplate, were found at Potter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home in the Lake District after she died in 1943. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These stories had not been published in the UK when Beatrix Potter was a child. It is therefore likely that her early contact with the Brer Rabbit tales (in comparison with the rest of the British public) was a result of her family roots in the cotton industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zobel Marshall writes. Potter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grandfather, Edmund Potter, was a Manchester cotton mill owner whose wealth was inherited by Beatrix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father, Rupert, a lawyer and photographer. Rupert married a wealthy heiress, Helen Leech, whose family were also cotton mill owners. By the early 19th century, the raw cotton used in these mills was sourced from the Americas, and Manchester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic success was deeply connected to the enslavement of African people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was amazed to realise how little comment there has been over the years about the many similarities between Potter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tales and the Africa-originated Brer Rabbit folktales\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Zobel Marshall said. In fact, as mentioned in Lear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biography, Potter herself acknowledged that her story The Tale of Mr Tod, the sequel to the Tale of Peter Rabbit, contained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imitation of Uncle Remus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a letter to her publisher. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having analysed the plotting, language and characters in her tales, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that Potter was more than just inspired by these folktales,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zobel Marshall said. Plot similarities between the two sets of stories abound, Zobel Marshall has noted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In Some Lady\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Garden (1883), for example, Brer Rabbit tricks Miss Janey into letting him into her father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vegetable garden to steal English peas, sparrow grass (asparagus) and goobers (peanuts) by pretending to be a friend of her father, Mr Man, from the big white (master\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) house\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the academic said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This plot is the main storyline in most of Potter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tales and is directly linked to the need for enslaved people to steal food from their masters to survive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Before Zobel Marshall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essay and book, American Trickster: Trauma, Tradition and Brer Rabbit, there had only been two detailed pieces of research connecting Potter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tales with Harris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier folktales. One was in children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s author John Goldthwaite\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1996 book, The Natural History of Make-Believe, and the other was literary critic Peter Hollindale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (unpublished) lecture, Uncle Remus and Peter Rabbit, at the Beatrix Potter Society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2003 annual general meeting. Potter herself \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never publicly admitted the source of any inspiration for her drawings, plotlines or protagonists\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Zobel Marshall says. Hollindale argued in his lecture that this may have been because she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misunderstood her own talent and, to the end of her life, was afraid of being caught out as a cheat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Zobel Marshall points out that it is not necessarily wrong for Potter to have been inspired by the Brer Rabbit stories. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By their nature, stories constantly change to suit the needs of their audiences, and this is particularly the case with oral storytelling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she writes. In fact, another well-known British children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s author, Enid Blyton, also wrote versions of the Brer Rabbit stories, but unlike Potter, Blyton acknowledged her sources. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Potter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions in shielding the reading public from her sources have fed into a damaging and reoccurring appropriation of Black cultural forms that continues today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zobel Marshall said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Beatrix Potter and Peter Rabbit brands are highly lucrative, yet I have found no references to the Black American sources of these tales in any of the Beatrix Potter museums and experiences in the UK and US, which attract hundreds of thousands of visitors yearly.

Nina Jankowicz sued Fox News and its parent company Fox Corporation for allegedly damaging her reputation as a specialist in conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns. The lawsuit was lodged in a Delaware state court exactly a year after she resigned as executive director of a new Department of Homeland Security unit combatting online disinformation. The Disinformation Governance Board was abruptly shut down in the wake of a storm of virulent rightwing criticism, allegedly fueled by Fox News. Jankowicz and the new DHS division she led were attacked as being part of a conspiracy to censor rightwing comment spearheaded by Joe Biden. Jankowicz resigned from the federal post on 18 May 2022, barely three weeks into the job. In an interview with the Guardian, she said her motive in suing Fox was to ensure accountability for what she alleged was a campaign of lies against her that undermined American democracy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There needs to be consequences,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was lies, very personal and very vitriolic lies. And I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that is democratic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She added that what she claimed was Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reckless disregard for the truth had implications for the future of the country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on statements of fact, how can you live in a democracy?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jankowicz was announced as the head of the new disinformation board on 27 April last year and was instantly engulfed in a tempest of rightwing anger. In the lawsuit, Jankowicz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers allege that the attacks skyrocketed the following day, after Fox News hosts began fuelling the hatred with unfounded claims about her desire to censor rightwing voices. One of the most vociferous critics, the complaint says, was Tucker Carlson, the news channel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then primetime star who was fired by Fox last month in the wake of the Dominion settlement. In his opening monologue on 28 April, Carlson called Jankowicz a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moron\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said that what she was doing amounted to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full-scale attack on free speech\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and dubbed the disinformation board \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the new Soviet America\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Other Fox hosts, including Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, followed suit, labelling her a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153useful idiot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153janko-half-witz\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153insane\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hannity went so far as to depict her as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the biggest perpetrators and purveyors of disinformation in the entire country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Fox &amp; Friends host Brian Kilmeade wondered why President Biden would give a pregnant woman such an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153important job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Jankowicz was eight months pregnant at the time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was weeks away from giving birth to my first kid when this was all happening,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jankowicz told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a time I will never get back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The attacks continued long after she had resigned her federal position. As recently as last month, Ingraham returned to the fray; the Fox News host played a clip of Jankowicz describing the harassment she had endured and commented: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just upset that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to censor everybody\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As an authority on disinformation campaigns, Jankowicz said she could predict the cycle of events that unfolded. Whenever Fox hosts attacked her on air, a swarm of online hate would be directed at her culminating in multiple death threats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every time they talked about me on Fox, a new wave of harassment would start. I would get a spike especially when Carlson and Hannity mentioned me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Many of the Fox attacks made a point of her gender, she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were focused on belittling me, cutting me down to size \u00e2\u20ac\u201c disregarding my serious work and the fact that I had been called as a Republican witness in Senate hearings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just to make me look like a silly little girl.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The new lawsuit adds to several legal actions piling up on Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plate. In addition to Dominion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $1.6bn suit, which alleged Fox had spread the lie that its voting machines helped steal the 2020 presidential election from Donald Trump, the media company is facing a separate action brought by another voting machine firm, Smartmatic. Carlson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former booker, Abby Grossberg, is also suing Fox alleging its one-time star fostered an abusive workplace culture. Jankowicz faces a daunting mountain to climb in taking on the Murdoch empire. As a public figure holding an important federal role at the time of the alleged defamation, she must clear a very high legal standard. She must show that the broadcaster acted with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153actual malice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in disseminating false statements about her that it knew were untrue, or that it showed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reckless disregard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in airing those statements without checking their veracity. The complaint claims that the channel mentioned more than 150 times that Jankowicz intended to monitor and censor free speech. In fact, the disinformation board had no powers to censor or surveil anyone, it was merely designed to co-ordinate the efforts of other government entities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They depicted me as a fascist who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stand up for free speech, when precisely standing up for free speech had been the purpose of my entire career,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The lawsuit also points to Fox hosts saying she was fired from the board when she in fact resigned. The Guardian invited Fox to respond to the claim that it knowingly or recklessly broadcast untruths about Jankowicz. A Fox spokesperson said the company has moved to have the case relocated from the Delaware state court to a federal court, but did not respond to any of the specific allegations. Jankowicz is bringing the action with the help of a gofundme page which has so far raised almost $60,000 towards her legal fees. She said she was heartened by that support, but stressed that money was not her motive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been cautioned time and time again that this might not be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworth it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 financially,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pursuing this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her aim she said was partly to show that individuals could also confront the powerful, not just businesses like Dominion and Smartmatic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These companies have venture capital firms behind them, they can afford fancy lawyers and years-long trials to hold Fox to account. For individuals like me, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much harder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that is something that our system can sustain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd By bringing the lawsuit, she runs the risk of potentially opening herself up to a renewed wave of criticism that she is attempting to limit free speech protected under the first amendment. The Guardian asked her whether suing for defamation was the best way to counter Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged disinformation. Jankowicz stressed that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pursue the lawsuit lightly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anybody should pursue a lawsuit just because someone said something mean about them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I have a thick skin. But I believe Fox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued lies about individuals are a greater threat to free speech and democracy than a carefully considered, narrow lawsuit like mine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said her main aim was to force Fox to answer for what she called its false statements of facts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That sort of coverage is not protected speech,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If Fox isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brought to account, they will not stop.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/19/west-hams-european-adventure-leaves-them-with-a-david-moyes-dilemma", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European adventure leaves them with a David Moyes dilemma | Jacob Steinberg", "lead": "The Hammers have struggled in the league and want a more exciting style but would they really ditch a manager who has taken them to a European final?", "author": "Jacob Steinberg", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T11:10:06Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035873", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8add56fa7cb7325c865d083803b7e0e6844d9ecf/0_73_3828_2297/500.jpg", "body": "The message coming out of West Ham at the start of the week was there would be no decision on the future of David Moyes until the end of the season. Yet by the time Pablo Fornals was beating two AZ Alkmaar defenders and running through to score in the 94th minute at the AFAS Stadion on Thursday night, it seemed absurd that anyone could possibly want to replace the manager. They were all off the bench when Fornals drove his low shot into the net, their reward for not treating the Europa Conference League as an inconvenience being a place in the final against Fiorentina. In those moments it was worth remembering that West Ham have put up with a lot of rubbish for much of their existence. This is the good stuff and, even if the standard of the Conference League has not been high, nobody who cares about West Ham was going to be sniffy about reaching a European final for the first time since 1976. The post-match scenes in the away dressing room summed it up. There was pure emotion from Moyes as he saluted his team and joined in the chants of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153West Ham are massive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Scot has managed more than 1,000 games and never won a major trophy, so who could begrudge him for letting loose? Moyes has had to fight. He has needed resolve to recover from his struggles at Manchester United and Sunderland, and he has done an outstanding job for West Ham. Away from the European adventure, though, this has been a trying campaign. West Ham, who expected far more after spending close to \u00c2\u00a3160m last summer, are only six points above the bottom three with two games left. Things could get nervy if Leeds, who are 18th, win at the London Stadium on Sunday. Moyes must be grateful that West Ham have a superior goal difference to their opponents. However, staying up would not provide cause for celebration. There have been complaints about the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cautious football, from inside and outside the dressing room, and Moyes has come close to the sack more than once. A lot of fans turned a while ago and the dissatisfaction was clear when a few held up a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moyes Out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd banner even after West Ham won at Fulham last month. Added to those grumbles is the fact the board has been sounding out potential replacements for Moyes for a while. Intermediaries are on notice. There is interest in Graham Potter, Marco Silva, Brendan Rodgers and Ange Postecoglou. There are other candidates in the background and there was a lot of noise about Paulo Fonseca a few weeks ago, though it now appears likely he will stay at Lille for another year. Either way, the issue remains live, albeit complicated by Moyes reaching the final. There is a yearning for a manager capable of playing a more exciting style. The feeling is that West Ham, who are at their most comfortable sitting deep and playing on the break, could focus more on developing attacking patterns in training. There is potential for more, even if Moyes was right to point to the importance of clean sheets after the victory over AZ Alkmaar. West Ham have money, play in a big stadium and will be in the Europa League if they beat Fiorentina. Yet they would be there thanks to Moyes. He has steadied them since returning in 2019. Once so dysfunctional, they have finished sixth and seventh under Moyes. Now they are a game from winning their first trophy since 1980. West Ham have a dilemma. Only two managers, Ron Greenwood and John Lyall, have lifted trophies in the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. Only one player, Bobby Moore, has captained them to a European trophy. Declan Rice, who wears the armband these days, is following in some illustrious footsteps. This is history in the making. There is an argument that Moyes should leave on a high if he wins, cementing his status as a club legend. But would he want to walk away and would West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest shareholder, David Sullivan, be brave enough to push for change? Both scenarios come with risks. Part company with Moyes, who offers a wealth of experience and stability, and West Ham would be accused of ingratitude. This summer will be hard. Rice is going, probably to Arsenal, and will leave a hole in midfield. Perhaps West Ham need the knowhow Moyes possesses. However, if they let him see out the final year of his contract they risk the same problems flaring up next season. Looking at the wider picture, West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s league form has been poor for 18 months. Several expensive signings have not worked out and Moyes, who works closely with the head of recruitment, Rob Newman, will not have as much control over transfers if he stays. The impending appointment of a director of football is a clear sign that West Ham are preparing for a different approach. The question nobody has the answer to is whether Moyes will be joining them on the journey."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/19/west-ukraine-win-war-military-support", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "Does the west really want Ukraine to win the war?

Despite huge pressure from their allies to demonstrate that the equipment and ammunition that have been committed can be converted into serious territorial gains, Ukrainian officials are at pains to assert that this coming campaign is unlikely to be decisive. Instead, gains are more likely to be slow and incremental than sweeping and extensive. Over the past year Ukraine has been forced to fight a war of attrition at truly punishing cost. Wars of attrition such as this are never quick, and it is naive to believe that it will be over soon. There is no room for the idea that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it will all be over by Christmas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. And probably not the Christmas afterwards either. Sustaining this effort into the medium- (one to three years) and long-term ( two to 10 years) will require a prodigious industrial effort, and a step-change in the supply of military equipment, far greater than what we have already seen. Whatever the situation is at the end of this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s series of operations, Russia is not going away. The threat from the east will persist. Speaking to a military and diplomatic delegation I attended in Kyiv earlier this month, one senior Ukrainian military official was asked what his message in a single term would be; he replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sustainability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They are thinking about how to keep their political and military situation stable on a much longer timescale. At the political level, Ukraine is pinning its hopes on a plan for eventual Nato membership. Nato nations will deal with how (or if) this is done at the forthcoming Vilnius summit in July. On the military front, the nature and scale of western assistance is completely insufficient to sustain Ukrainian efforts to retake their land. The reality is that the astonishing successes of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence forces have been based on a largely ex-Soviet inventory. Nato equipment has augmented, but not displaced, this equipment. As the inexorable power of attrition takes effect on their existing kit, the requirement for new and better armaments in large quantities will increase. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take tanks as an indicator as to how far short the west is falling. So far, the US and allied countries have pledged about 140 reasonably modern western-made vehicles. Germany says it has delivered 18 Leopard 2s (rumours in Kyiv indicate that about half of them are not ready for combat). Earlier this week, more (albeit older \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Leopard 1) models were promised as part of an increased German commitment. The UK has donated 10% of its tank force in the form of 14 Challenger 2 tanks. So far, so good. The US has promised 31 Abrams tanks; Denmark and the Netherlands have jointly pledged 14; and various other countries (Spain, Poland, Canada, Norway) are promising a few dozen more, some of which have been delivered. However, the 31 US Abrams are not due until the autumn and the Dutch and Danish models will arrive in early 2024. To put this into context, last September the commander of the Ukrainian forces, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, asked for at least 300 new western tanks for the forthcoming campaign alone. Zaluzhnyi has received fewer than 100 relatively modern tanks and a slightly larger number of armoured fighting vehicles. Nato countries are suffering from stresses on their supplies of equipment and ammunition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly artillery shells \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the short term. Yet the US alone has more than 2,000 M1A2 Abrams tanks in storage, with thousands more artillery systems and armoured fighting vehicles. There are no military reasons for this equipment not to be released to Ukraine. Not a single one of these platforms would be of any use in a conflict with China, the current and likely future preoccupation of the US defence establishment. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to Ukraine, they will never be used. As matters stand, the supply of weapons and ammunition is carried out in a rather ad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hoc fashion through a process known as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. This amounts to a monthly meeting at Ramstein air base in Germany where Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needs are matched with the declared resources of the 54-nation group. At the last meeting, there was discussion (for 90 minutes) on developing a more sustainable and long-term approach. There was even mention of a coherent development of an industrial strategy, which both world wars demonstrated was essential to victory. If we are genuinely interested in helping Ukraine to succeed in its basic objectives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which sometimes may seem in doubt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we need to get serious about replacing the current piecemeal system of drip-feed donations with a large-scale systematic resupply and re-equipment. And the planning needs to begin now. The aim must be to help Ukraine create armed forces able to integrate properly with its western allies and defend itself beyond the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spring offensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The reward for success will be a new, invigorated and dynamic component of our polity. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Frank Ledwidge is a barrister and former military officer who has served in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Over the weekend, the singer won praise for calling out a guard, mid-performance, who was being rough with a female fan. However, as a queer Swiftie, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but wish she would channel that same energy and her enormous platform into denouncing the record number of anti-LGBTQ+ laws being introduced across the US. Since starting in March, Swift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eras tour has taken her to numerous states that have ushered in some of the most extreme anti-LGBTQ+ bills in decades, including Florida, Tennessee and Texas. Yet the singer has stayed silent. For some, Swift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence undermines, or at least draws into question, the flurry of LGBTQ+ advocacy she embarked on in 2019. After a gay friend helped Taylor realise her position on LGBTQ+ rights wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear enough or loud enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she came out swinging for the gays. Close to a million people signed her petition in support of the Equality Act, she brought drag queens on stage with her at a major award show, and also made enormous donations to LGBTQ+ charities such as Glaad and the Tennessee Equality Project. (She also released the homophobe-bashing single You Need to Calm Down, though perhaps erasing that from our collective memory would be more of a win for LGBTQ+ rights.) When Swift broke her political silence in 2018 by publicly supporting two Democrats in the US midterm elections it felt like a watershed moment. The singer had seemed to have gotten over being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so fearful of making a mistake that [she would] just freeze\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as she once told Vogue. As she said in her 2020 documentary, Miss Americana, she cared more about being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the right side of history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Which is why her silence now feels so loud. But the issue of pop and politics goes beyond Swift, raising questions about our expectations of pop stars, figureheads who have by and large become more politicised over the past decade. Should artists use their platforms to speak out on social issues, and if so, how often and to what extent? (The current calls for Swift to denounce past controversies by her rumoured boyfriend, Matty Healy of the 1975, for example, are both misogynist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c expecting a woman to account for her partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and demonstrative of fan entitlement.) Do we expect them to understand and respond to all the hot-button issues going on around the world? Which countries (or states, for that matter) is it OK for them to perform in? Now more than ever, these are valid questions to ask of pop stars. Major pop tours are watercooler events akin to sports games, Succession and Eurovision: one of the biggest platforms around, speaking directly not only to young audiences who look to their idols for support, but the wider public who might be influenced by their views. And queer fans can reasonably expect to see support for their causes because today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pop spectacle was built on the backs of trailblazing queer icons, to whom every star owes a spiritual debt. (In 2017, Swift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Reputation tour paid nightly tribute to the 19th-century US dancer Loie Fuller, a gay woman who pioneered modern dance and theatrical lighting and fought for artists to own their work.) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understandable that many stars are wary about speaking out, particularly when on stage. Audiences have come for a show, not a political rally. Perhaps that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why some stars opt for softer actions, such as Harry Styles waving a Pride flag or Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 making venue toilets gender-neutral on her current Renaissance tour. These gestures of support can mean so much for a young queer or questioning fan. But Madonna put her career on the line in the 80s and 90s with her HIV/Aids activism, including a card detailing The Facts About Aids enclosed with 1989\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Like a Prayer album. Considering we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re living through an era of humanitarian and climate crises with a growing backlash against the rights of women, people of colour and LGBTQ+ people, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pop stars aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taking radical enough action. So while we can applaud artists such as Lizzo, Orville Peck, Kelsea Ballerini and Hayley Kiyoko for their recent advocacy against the anti-drag and trans laws emerging across the US, statements and symbolic gestures won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything to help the families of queer and trans kids fleeing Texas and Florida. What matters today is how pop stars who want to make a difference use their voice, platform and wealth to materially improve the lives of vulnerable communities. Shortly after the Grenfell tragedy in 2017, Adele stopped her Wembley concert to plead with the audience to donate \u00c2\u00a35 to the Unite for Grenfell relief efforts. On the Eras tour, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been revealed that Swift is making \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sizeable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd donations to local food banks at each stop. Boycotts can also be effective. It was only seven years ago that North Carolina introduced an anti-LGBTQ+ bathroom bill, which sparked such a huge backlash that businesses left the state and major sporting events and concerts were cancelled. Less than a year later, the draconian law was repealed. LGBTQ+ communities are fighting for their freedom and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s those kinds of actions that could make a meaningful difference to their safety. Imagine if pop stars highlighted local queer groups at each of their concert venues with donation stands. Or if they signposted information about local, state and national politicians fans could contact about anti-LGBTQ+ legislation. It would also be extremely powerful to see this done by artists without obvious queer fanbases such as Drake or Bruce Springsteen (who was among the artists to cancel shows in North Carolina in 2016). With all eyes on these tours and every moment being beamed directly to TikTok, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re one of the most powerful platforms out there and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devastating that more isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being made of these opportunities. The era of speak now is over. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for pop stars who care about equality to act now. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Jeffrey Ingold is a freelance journalist writing about culture and LGBTQ+ issues"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/19/florida-voter-registration-voter-fraud-formerly-incarcerated", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "He voted in Florida for the first time in 2020.

John Boyd Rivers, a mason who once laid the bricks of the courthouse, stood up to hear whether or not they would convict him on two counts of voter fraud. Judge James Colaw read the verdict on the first charge: not guilty. Then he read the verdict on the second: guilty. Rivers stood quietly as he listened, a small hole visible in the red long-sleeve shirt he wore to court over khaki pants and work boots. It was a result that was unimaginable to Rivers, 45, who voted for the first time in his life in 2020. Rivers became interested in doing so in February of that year when he was being held in the county jail on a different charge. One day, TJ Pyche, the outreach director at the local elections office, came to his unit with voter registration forms. An eager employee just a few weeks shy of his 25th birthday, Pyche told the inmates that Florida had recently changed its voting laws, making it easier for those with felony convictions to cast a ballot. Rivers remembers asking Pyche if he could vote while in jail on a violation of his probation. As Rivers remembers it, Pyche said that he could as long as his prior convictions weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for murder or sex offenses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c crimes that result in the permanent loss of voting rights in Florida. Rivers hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been convicted of those crimes, so he filled out a voter registration application, registering as a Republican, and gave it to Pyche. When Rivers eventually received a voter registration card in the mail, he believed he was eligible to vote. And he was thrilled, as it made him feel as if he was a part of something. That fall, he cast his first ballot in the presidential election. Nearly two years later, Rivers was indicted for voter fraud along with nine other people who registered with Pyche. In dozens of cases in Florida, prosecutors have filed charges against people with felony convictions who believed they were eligible to vote, received voter registration cards in the mail and then later turned out to be ineligible because of their criminal history. Many of those cases are being handled by a new statewide unit focused on voter fraud created by Governor Ron DeSantis. But no local prosecutor has brought more charges than Brian Kramer, the elected state attorney in Alachua county, who is prosecuting 10 people, including Rivers. Voting advocates have decried the prosecutions across Florida as intimidating, designed to dissuade people who are uncertain about their eligibility from voting. And they are particularly alarmed at those prosecutions enabled by Pyche, an official elections office employee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They set up about a dozen people, essentially, set them up, sent them a voter registration card, encouraged them to register, sent them a voter registration card, and then when they registered, the supervisor of elections office \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nobody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charged from [that office],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Andrew Darling, Rivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lawyer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It sends a message that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want you voting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American states have a long, ugly history of using law enforcement to intimidate and suppress voters,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Blair Bowie, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center who specializes in restoring voting rights for people with felony convictions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is clearly what is happening in Florida. We should be paying attention because other states may follow suit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kramer, a Republican elected in 2020, dismissed those concerns. He noted his office has started a program to help those with felonies figure out their voting eligibility, though he acknowledged few people had utilized it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My job is simply to enforce the law as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s written by the legislature and if it has a deterrent effect, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in an interview in his office in downtown Gainesville. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All prosecutions are intimidating.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd *** Rivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 case was just the second of the voter fraud cases in Florida to make it to trial. A central issue in the case was whether he knew he had to repay all of his outstanding debts related to prior criminal cases before he could vote. For the last few years, that repayment requirement has been the subject of intense scrutiny in Florida. In 2018, voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment allowing people with felonies to vote once they completed their sentence. But in 2019, Republicans in the legislature imposed the new requirement that fines and fees would have to be paid off in order to vote. Voting rights groups sued, saying the measure was essentially a poll tax. Florida did not have a centralized way to check voters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 eligibility, so it would be extremely difficult for anyone to figure out what they owe. A federal judge struck down the law in 2019, but that ruling was later overturned by a federal appellate court, upholding the law. When the US supreme court allowed the law to go into effect for the 2020 election, Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, saying Florida had created a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pay-to-vote scheme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would block people from voting because they were poor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The voting cases happening in Alachua county and across the state put a human face on our broken election system,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Neil Volz, the deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, the main group that pushed a 2018 constitutional amendment expanding voting rights for people with felonies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The people of Florida deserve better.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When Rivers registered, he owed thousands of dollars in debts related to prior criminal cases. Pyche testified that when he visited the jail, he repeatedly said that anyone who wanted to vote had to have completed their sentence and paid off all fines, fees and restitution. A jail employee who accompanied him on his visits corroborated what he said. But Rivers says he never heard anything about fines and fees. An informational flyer that Pyche carried was also confusing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it said someone could vote when they completed all terms of their sentence, but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t specify repaying outstanding debts. Pyche testified that he could not recall meeting Rivers or what specifically he said on the day Rivers registered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow the rules,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Marguiles, the prosecutor who handled the case, said during the trial. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Voting requires effort. Citizenship requires effort. John Rivers did not display effort.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rivers faced two criminal charges. One for illegally signing up to vote and a second for illegally voting. Both were punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Rivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 attorneys argued that he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be held liable for illegally registering because he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t known about the requirement that he had to repay fines and fees in order to vote. Once he received his voter registration card in the mail, no one had told him he was ineligible. The local elections office only reviewed his application to make sure that it was completely filled out before issuing him a voter registration card. Under Florida law, the secretary of state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office is supposed to review all new applications to determine someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eligibility. In Rivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 case, it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t raise any issues. There was much confusion over the law at the time, Kim Barton, the county supervisor of elections, testified during the trial. The secretary of state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office was backlogged in reviewing applications. To complicate matters further, in April 2020, after Rivers received his voter registration card in the mail, he pleaded guilty to a new felony and was placed on probation, once again losing his voting rights. But he still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t receive any notice from the state telling him that and voted in November. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until October 2021, nearly a year later, that the state notified the Alachua county elections office that Rivers was ineligible and removed him from the rolls. Prosecutors maintained that Pyche had informed Rivers about the outstanding debt obligations and that it was Rivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 responsibility to know his eligibility. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They gave a voter registration card to everyone. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean their rights have been restored,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marguiles, the prosecutor, said. Had he understood that he needed to repay outstanding debts, Rivers says he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have cast a ballot. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to repay the thousands of dollars he owes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he is out of work and has eight children. His driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license is suspended and he had to rely on his lawyer to get to and from court on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give what I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. *** At the end of the trial on Tuesday, the seven-member jury \u00e2\u20ac\u201c three white women and four white men \u00e2\u20ac\u201c deliberated for around an hour and a half. It had little trouble reaching consensus, said Janet Heern, a 64-year-old retiree who served as the jury foreperson. When it came to registering, they believed Rivers was genuinely confused. The language on the voter registration form wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear and they took Rivers at his word when he said that he believed it to be an application that would be rejected if he was ineligible. She also said Rivers should have been able to rely on guidance from Pyche, who was in a position of authority. But when it came to actual voting, the jurors were less forgiving. After he pleaded guilty to the April felony, Rivers was on house arrest. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plausible to Heern and the other jurors that he would continue to think he could vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I vote all the time and I take it seriously. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a right but you have to have some responsibility too,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Heern said. She added that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Rivers should have been prosecuted in the first place. If prosecutors were going to go after Rivers, she said, they should also bring charges against the supervisor of elections. After the verdict, Colaw turned to figuring out a sentence. On the one hand, he was concerned that Rivers had been acting at the request of the office of the supervisor of elections. On the other hand, Rivers had a lengthy criminal history and had repeatedly violated his probation. Earlier in the trial, Marguiles dismissed the suggestion that Pyche and Barton bore responsibility for registering Rivers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Poor TJ,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was trying to do a good thing for the community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Barton said she still thought her office did a good job running the program, even though 10 people had been charged with voter fraud. When she was asked whether her office would continue the jail outreach program, she took a short pause before saying softly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think I will.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ultimately, Colaw sentenced Rivers to two years of supervised probation, requiring him to check in with a probation officer every month, as well as 50 hours of community service. Rivers, who had been stoic for nearly all of the trial, quietly wiped away tears as Colaw read the sentence. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the worst possible punishment. But in the lead-up to the trial, prosecutors had offered him an even better deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one year of unsupervised probation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if he pleaded guilty to one of the charges. Rivers refused. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to get rolled over this time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/19/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup", "primaryCategory": "books", "title": "The best recent crime and thrillers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c review roundup", "lead": "The Last Dance by Mark Billingham; Grave Expectations by Alice Bell; Children of the Sun by Beth Lewis; Now You See Us by Balli Kaur Jaswal; The Monk by Tim Sullivan", "author": "Laura Wilson", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T11:00:26Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035890", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/72d69a09552d3c416d9cabb30b81f4d81d3a0676/128_336_6550_3930/500.jpg", "body": "The Last Dance by Mark Billingham (Sphere, \u00c2\u00a322) Set in Blackpool, Mark Billingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new series starts with the killing of two men \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one the heir to a crime empire, the other an IT consultant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in adjacent hotel bedrooms, and proceeds at a smart clip, expertly bedding in characters along the way. The protagonist, widowed DS Declan Miller, provides a novel spin on the emotionally-unfit-copper-returning-to-work-too-soon trope. His hobbies are ballroom dancing, pet rats and mentally discussing the case with his late wife, Alex, a police officer killed in the line of duty. A gobby maverick, Miller treats everything with a mixture of sarcasm and dad humour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which might be hard to take, were he not perfectly balanced by his new work partner, Yamaha-riding thrash metal devotee DS Sara Xiu, who never, ever, gets the jokes. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a memorable supporting cast, and the overarching mystery of his wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death provides a hook for titles to come. Billingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tom Thorne series set the bar very high indeed, but The Last Dance is well up to standard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c funny, moving and expertly plotted. Grave Expectations by Alice (Bell Corvus, \u00c2\u00a314.99) Phantoms abound in Alice Bell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut, a modern mashup of Ghosts, Blithe Spirit and Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased). Medium Claire Hendricks has an advantage over other table-tappers: not only can she actually see ghosts, but her best friend at school, Sophie, who was murdered at the age of 17, has hung out with her ever since. When Claire provides birthday party entertainment at a country pile, she realises that someone has recently been killed there, and she and Sophie team up with a depressed ex-copper and his blue-haired nibling to find out whodunnit. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a while before the mystery element of the book is properly up and running, but the lightly acerbic style is a delight and the interaction between inept-but-dogged millennial Claire and eternal teenager Sophie \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose death remains a mystery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c offers plenty of spooky fun.

Living off grid, deep in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adirondack Mountains, the members of the Atlas community, all of whom have lost loved ones, are preparing for the opening of the Golden Door, which they believe will deliver them to a parallel reality in which the tragedies did not happen. Three not entirely reliable narrators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c journalist James, trying to maintain professional distance even as grief for his dead lover draws him in; Root, one of a handful of children being prepared for a special role in the ceremony; and Eve, who is on a quest to find cult leader Sol \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pass the narrative baton between them. An intriguing mystery with a wholly unexpected ending, and a moving exploration of loss, trauma, belief and unintended consequences. Now You See Us by Balli Kaur Jaswal (HarperCollins, \u00c2\u00a314.99) Balli Kaur Jaswal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fifth novel is a satisfying character-led mystery set in Singapore, among the Filipina maids who toil for long hours in rich households in order to send money home. Workers Corazon, Donita and Angel are friends who share tales of their treatment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the punishments meted out to Donita by her never-satisfied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122am\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; the unwanted attentions of Angel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 son.

The Monk by Tim Sullivan (Head of Zeus, \u00c2\u00a320) The fifth novel in Tim Sullivan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s series featuring neurodiverse detective George Cross of the Avon and Somerset Police is an investigation into the death of Benedictine monk Brother Dominic, whose badly beaten body, tied to a chair, has been found in a ditch at a West Country beauty spot. A former banker, Brother Dominic swapped mammon for God some 15 years earlier and lived a quiet life devoting himself to beekeeping, bookbinding and worship.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a neighbour of Kingston upon Thames, and close to Worcester Park, Norbiton, Tolworth and many other semi-anonymous suburbs that never trouble the Places To Eat Before You Die foodie bucket lists. What gives the area its sparkle, however, is its Korean population, which some say numbers only about 800, but could in reality be many more, because that figure doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take into account all the temporary visitors, hungry South Korean and Chinese-Korean tourists and, presumably, quiet North Korean ones, too, though no one keeps much of a record on them. Regardless of the headcount, there are upwards of 20 more-than-decent Korean restaurants in New Malden, providing the opportunity to eat pajeon, bibimbap, bulgogi, noodles and hotpots; there are also a load of supermarkets where you can stock up on gochugaru and soju, plus cafes selling sweet treats such as patbingsu, a shaved ice dessert topped with sweet stewed adzuki beans that, to my mind, is one of the most delicious things on earth. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the firmness of the beans, you see, and the sugary hit of the burgundy-coloured sauce surrounding them. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not hugely familiar with Korean food, consider patbingsu and the spring onion and/or seafood pancake pajeon as your gateway drugs. I had been tipped off that they served a very good pajeon at Cah Chi on the Kingston Road, a family-run spot that has changed venues a few times over the years and opened here only a month or so ago, but has retained a loyal fanbase for its simple yet delicious taste of home. I visited on a wet Wednesday lunchtime, half-expecting to be one of the only customers, but found the place packed, due in no small part to Cah Chi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warm welcome, and to the fact that a round of steamed saewoo mandu (seafood dumplings) comes with some of the most glorious fresh banchan (small plates): a dainty pile of lush, green, wonderfully seasoned spinach, pickled cucumber, fierce, roughly hewn kimchi and a mound of black, sticky, braised soy beans. Then the pajeon arrives, teeming with spring onion, prawns and the odd squid tentacle, all suspended in a spongy, crisp batter made of rice flour, egg, soy and gochugaru. It is good. Very good. Perhaps a little thicker than the slender, elegant versions available at the likes of Yori in London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fancy West End, but all the more luscious for it. A gorgeous side of half a fried aubergine arrives with a sticky glaze, its innards soft, pale and squishy, its black exterior still firmly bulbous. The whole thing is perfect, and hugely entertaining for the lunching Korean grandmothers watching me try to eat its slippery innards with stainless-steel chopsticks. What I lack in finesse, I make up for in hapless enthusiasm to transfer my deftly seasoned, soft-skinned mandu one by one into my mouth without spilling their bounteous filling down my front. Cah Chi is one of those cheap and cheerful, but decidedly good places that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing to look at from the outside. It has about it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lady-friendly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, floral-wallpapered air, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decorated much more nicely than many hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in. Great staff, too, who love their community of older customers and seem to know them all by name. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also incredibly kind to women from Carlisle, and help me no end with my struggles to grill the beef bulgogi, bringing more fresh lettuce leaves to wrap it in, as well as extra helpings of their moreish soybean dipping paste. The bulgogi is sweet, slightly spicy and makes you wish, as you schlepp home, that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ordered more. My days of drinking soju are long over, so I drink barley tea, which is served in a dainty green teapot. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much in the mood for anything sweet, either, but was ever so politely pushed by the lovely waitress into a small scoop of green tea ice-cream topped with a large blob of red-bean paste. New Malden is an umami-drenched patch of extreme deliciousness that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 20 minutes from Waterloo by train; sure, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really en route to anywhere, but it is an eating destination in its own right. There are several theories as to how it became so very Korean: some say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the Korean ambassador used to live here, others that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of the relatively affordable house prices (well, for London, anyway). It can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be because of the splendour of the train station, which feels older than time itself and is hidden behind a moody tower block. This area is proof, however, that when the stars align, the dining options can be quite incredible. Cah Chi isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trying to change the world; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just quietly representing skilful Korean cooking and creating a haven for hungry passers-by. Consider me a fan.

Goldsmith, a financier from a privileged dynasty of bankers and socialites, has become well known in recent years for his sometimes controversial proclamations on nature and rewilding, campaigning against intensive sheep farming, and for the reintroduction of wolves in the UK. But it is only since his bereavement that the leading Conservative, who this month published a book about Iris and nature, has dedicated his life to the cause. He explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the aftermath of losing Iris, when everything seemed to be blackness and darkness, and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really imagine finding any kind of meaning or hope or joy, or light or colour in anything, I found that my love of nature carried me in a way that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a particular moment I remember so clearly. Just a few days after the accident, I wandered on my own, kind of bleary eyed down to swim in my pond. I just jumped into the pond and found myself feeling OK. It carried me, or held me in a way I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After that, looking at his Somerset farm, he thought that he could bring back some of the nature to it, help it to heal and come back to life: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Doing that has given me more joy than any project or anything I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked on all my life. The changes were almost instantaneous. As soon as we removed 50 sheep, 50 cows and removed 10 skiploads of barbed wire fencing, we rebuilt the stream, we filled in the ditches and ripped up the field drains and just let the land breathe. The place just felt like a kind of sleeping giant that was starting to awaken. It was like life was reawakening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I found spending time in that nature and watching this happen gave me a sense of joy and meaning and hope that perhaps was absent elsewhere because we were living with the terrible darkness of having lost Iris. And so for me being able to spend time in nature and even better having the privilege of being able to participate in the restoration of nature, was the most important thing in my life at that time, and remains so today because I feel that that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the purpose of my life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For many of those who face a sudden loss, the feeling that it cannot be healed or fixed can be overwhelming. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the very beginning I found it impossible to cope with the feelings of wanting to fix something that couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be fixed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldsmith said. He replayed the accident, in which Iris was trapped under an all-terrain vehicle on his Somerset estate, over in his mind, finding solutions that were impossible to enact: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remember it felt like in a car garage when they take the car off the ground and raise it up. And then they rev the engine and the wheels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any tarmac. So the engine over revs. Well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sort of what my mind was doing. You know, as a father of young children, the person that is good at fixing problems and making things better. There was nothing I could do. So my brain just went round and round and round; what if she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d come a different day? What if she hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t driven that vehicle? What if the grass hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cut three days before and so she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stuck on the track \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 there were so many what ifs. It drove me to distraction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But bringing life back to his land helped Goldsmith begin to recover. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Being able to heal something else and fix something else, perhaps in Iris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honour too, perhaps that was the reason why it was so healing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Goldsmith realised that many people do not have the privilege of easy access to nature that he does. He says he has since convinced London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan, to set up a rewilding taskforce to bring nature to underprivileged communities in the city. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think there is a terribly underappreciated and pernicious inequity in this country when it comes to access to nature. I think all human beings viscerally need contact with nature, even if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully know it themselves. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I realised how unfair it is that people who live in the city often don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access to nature at all, particularly those that come from ethnic minorities and from lower-income backgrounds. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason why there shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be vibrant nature in the city; we should have wild, colourful, beautiful nature woven right through the fabric of our cities, people should have access to nature where they live, no matter where it is that they live.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although many Conservatives sympathise with landowners on the subject of public access to nature, Goldsmith has become sympathetic to the right to roam. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think there is an issue in terms of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to access the countryside in this country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and that issue is no more pointedly illustrated than when you see beaches crammed with people like sardines, because the only place they can go is the beach. Now I find those pictures really depressing. The French and the Spanish fan out into their countryside in all directions when the weather\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice, and they have access in all kinds of different ways. And so I think finding a way for people to access the countryside in a more fair and open way is really important.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In this Goldsmith is at odds with many of his colleagues, who have railed against new nature-friendly farming payments and said eagles are not welcome in their constituencies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I disagree passionately and wholeheartedly with those elements of the Conservative party which are backward on the need to restore nature in our country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said with genuine annoyance, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and I take particular objection to the way that they use valid concerns around things such as food security, or the culture of rural society being under threat by nature recovery \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and their arguments are completely without merit. I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re disingenuous and dishonest and wholly wrong. And I think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be left on the wrong side of history as these things advance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldsmith says he has not ruled out backing Labour in the next general election, if the party puts out a stronger proposition than the Conservatives for nature. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will vote for the candidate that is the most ambitious on nature and climate in my constituency,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by far the biggest issue, and I would absolutely spend my money on and give my vote to anything that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to advance that agenda.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Goldsmith, whose brother Zac is a Tory peer and minister, was on the board of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs until last year. He found it an eye-opening experience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I joined the Defra board, I was horrified to discover the degree to which the National Farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Union and also the industrial fishing representatives were able to influence government policy. There was an old boys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 club and a bit of a revolving door approach, whereby they all knew each other and anyone who dared stand up to those two industry representative groups was cowed into submission very quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are winning. A lot of the rage we see in the papers and on social media today from those interests is coming about because they know that their influence is starting to wane, and that their grip is loosening and that the British public, and journalists and politicians are waking up to how absolutely trashed nature is and how things really do have to change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd God is An Octopus is published by Bloomsbury and is out now"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/19/the-guide-87-somebody-save-us-from-the-awkward-advert-dancing-trend", "primaryCategory": "culture", "title": "The Guide #87: Somebody save us from the awkward advert dancing trend", "lead": "In this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newsletter: Car showrooms have been transformed into dancefloors for some seriously shonky moves in the latest pointless ad-break craze", "author": "Gwilym Mumford", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T10:50:37Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035903", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f50088cdc915e10a213259af1742a9173169134b/234_142_1560_936/500.jpg", "body": "Back in the days when The Guide was a chunky A5 newspaper supplement rather than this sleek digital newsletter, it ran a column called The Hard Sell where, every week, a TV advertisement would get a gentle shoeing by a writer. Any ad that was particularly egregious would make an appearance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c celebs whispering about perfume, ads for whisky companies where everyone is having fun \u00e2\u20ac\u0153responsibly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than drinking themselves into a stupor, Kevin Bacon shouting about 5G. There were certain recurring themes that would crop up, too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was a period where 90% of adverts seemed to feature a Yorkshire man reading a poem (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153this is for the dreamers, the strivers, the deep sea divers \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 visit sandalsholidays-dot-com for more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, that sort of thing). And who can forget the betting site reign of terror of the mid 00s, when braying lads with nicknames like The Gut Truster roamed the land, barking odds at whichever consumer had the misfortune of encountering them. The Hard Sell was retired in 2017, but if it was still continuing today there is one trend that would dominate. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talking of course about excessive advert dancing. In 2023 it is impossible to survive an ad break \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be it terrestrial or on streaming \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without being assailed by someone witlessly bouncing around or waving their arms about like Joey from Friends. Mostly they involve members of the public, or people pretending to be them, dancing goofily to dance hits of years gone by. The most egregious example is We Buy Any Car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hideous series of ads involving various people breaking into a jig to the tune of Nightcrawlers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 90s dance hit Push the Feeling On upon selling their old bangers. Then there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hey Car\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spots, with their car dealers dancing in a showroom, Zopa Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pair of anthropomorphic air fresheners bopping about, and the older gentleman sauntering around with a loo roll in the NHS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (admittedly very worthwhile) bowel cancer screening ads. Plus, in a rare sighting of the awkward dancing trend intersecting with the celeb hawking something trend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Daniel Craig tangoing with a bottle of Belvedere vodka (this one arguably gets a pass, being a well-choreographed piece of work rather than a man doing the worm in a car showroom forecourt.). This trend, I should add, is distinct from the dancing ad trend of the early 2010s, which involved skilled professional performers rather than tax solicitors from Ipswich. That trend I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a problem with: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to see someone displaying masterful control of their own body, and if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have products rammed down our throats for five minutes every quarter of an hour, let us at least witness something genuinely impressive in the process. But amateur ad dancing is not impressive: instead it brings to mind, with a shudder, my own two-left-footedness on club dancefloors across the country. There are few things worse than having to watch someone dance badly, and with a sinister rictus grin spread across their face to boot. I find it genuinely chilling. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an air of desperation, too, to these adverts. Many of them are hawking car insurance or price comparison websites \u00e2\u20ac\u201c painfully uninteresting products that require an awful lot of heavy lifting to build name recognition with consumers. (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why comparethemarket.com has constructed a decade-long meerkat-based storyline that, by now, has become more difficult to follow than Twin Peaks.) And many of them are having to contend with a cultural environment where adverts do not have the primacy they once did: the days of 23 million people tuning in to see the conclusion of Renault\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Papa, Nicole\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd spots are long gone. Today, thanks to platforms like Netflix or Disney+, people are used to avoiding adverts altogether. And if they do encounter ads, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re usually accompanied with a skip button, or a little timer indicating how many seconds of adverts they have to sit through before they can actually watch what they tuned in for in the first place. Adverts are treated as something to try and avoid at all costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no wonder the TV ad market is projected to shrink by 5% in 2023.

Or see what-whats. Or whatever. I would love to take part. To live in a mansion is my greatest dream. Basically, the only ambition I have ever had in life is to live in a house so big I never have to leave home. Want a change of scene? Spend a day or two in the east wing, then the west, before returning home-home to the middle beautifully refreshed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like a swimming pool but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a home cinema. Library, obviously. A sprawling floor each for husband and child so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to see each other except by choice and/or scheduled appointment (nearly 20 years into the whole \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfamily\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 business and I still find it an outrage that I am expected to interact with them just whenever they see fit). Grounds I can walk in for miles knowing that I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see another soul. I shall fast-forward through the boring open relationship parts. Anyone planning to do likewise and with a decent amount of equity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c please get in touch. I have a plan. Tuesday It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a while but Ann Widdecombe returned to the fray on fine form in an interview on the BBC Politics Live programme. When asked what she would say to people who, in a cost of living crisis, cannot afford to pay for basics such as the ingredients for a cheese sandwich, she replied \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, then you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do the cheese sandwich,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before going on to explain that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no such thing as a right to low inflation to keep things \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like the daily intake of calories compatible with life \u00e2\u20ac\u201c affordable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed this! It took me right back to the days when she was prisons minister, responsible for keeping pregnant women shackled during labour and all that. I remember feeling sorry for people whose memories didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stretch back far enough to appreciate her bid for national treasure status via 2010\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Strictly for the roiling piece of absurdity and self-delusion it was. But now she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back with, in essence, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153let them eat air\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Attagirl. Wednesday I pledged to emigrate to Japan a few months ago when I experienced my first heated loo seat (that wonderful country, having been at the forefront of such technology, has, I am reliably informed, made such installations de rigueur throughout the land). I was transported to a hitherto undreamed of world of comfort, of utter, utter bliss. You could never have persuaded me, absent the actual touch of buttock to pre-warmed lavatory, that it could make such a difference. Now, I am drawing up the repatriation papers with even greater rapidity and fervour as I learn that in Japan they are deploying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smile tutors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help people relearn how to deploy their maxillofacial muscles properly now that the years-long requirement to wear masks to prevent the spread of Covid has been dropped. As a lifelong possessor of what is commonly if not entirely decorously known as Resting Bitch Face \u00e2\u20ac\u201c AKA looking as miserable as sin whatever the prevailing conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is something that, like the heated toilet seat, I have needed all my life without fully realising it. Imagine, someone who can teach you how to smile! Which is to say, someone who can teach you how to fit more seamlessly into society so that you may go about your business more unobtrusively. Because that is the real point of being able to make yourself look pleasant. Instead of badgering you about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Literally just my face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) or urging you to cheer up, it means people leave you alone. Almost as blissful as a warmed bottom. Thursday Martha Stewart has posed for the cover of the annual Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition at the age of 81. What are we to make of this? Is it a sign that ageism is in retreat? That homogeneous beauty standards are on their way out? That experience and wisdom are starting to be prized over youth, stupidity and collagen-rich flesh? Absolutely not, no! It is a sign that one preternaturally gorgeous octogenarian woman has been allowed on the front cover of an infamously sexist institution to rebut all the claims that it is or has ever been an infamously sexist institution, despite the photographs being lit, shot and/or doctored in such a way as to make her appear no more than 40 (and a Martha Stewart 40 at that). And a sign that you are only a viable woman if you can still make it on to the cover of Sports Illustrated and give a slice of the demographic the horn into your ninth decade. Just to clear that up. In case any young folk are confused out there. Friday I was deliberately early for a meeting on Kings Road because Chelsea, that once bohemian enclave of London, always fascinates me. It was always rich (bohemian costs money, otherwise it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just hippy skank and there are no mansion blocks in hippy skankland) but now it is just mooooneeeeyyyyy. Mostly new money, but some of the old, arty stuff clings on. Older couples with cut-glass accents carve their way through the blingy Europeans and astonishing ambulant sets of eyebrows and adventures in facial filler that comprise the bulk of the passersby. They are united only by their unconscious willingness to flick the likes of me into the gutter rather than break step. I stopped for a coffee in one of the posher cafes (hey, I was dressed nice for a meeting and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had a shower and everything). A slim, coiffed, camel-coated, tan-jumpered, beige-trousered woman was sitting with her handbag placed on the only free chair. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sorry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said, gesturing towards it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is there anyone coming to sit here? Do you mind if I \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She, perfectly agreeably, moved her bag and I sat down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Have you been here long?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What country are you from?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was perplexed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153England?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always lived in London.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now it was her turn to look perplexed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then why were you so worried about sitting down?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been turning this over in my mind ever since. As a fellow Englishwoman, was I supposed to feel hers was a kind of handbag of the commons? Even though my hesitation was in fact due to the fact that I am quite common? What about common courtesy? What life had she led that asking permission to intrude on someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s space was something that spurred deep inquiry? What happens when someone who is foreign does it because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that this is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I presume \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a privilege she only extends to the English?

Saleh Mirhashemi, Majid Kazemi and Saeed Yaqoubi were killed on Friday morning, the Tasnim agency reported. Crowds had gathered outside the prison where they were being held on Thursday night as rumours of their imminent executions grew. Cultural figures inside and outside Iran as well as family members had stepped up a campaign over the past week to halt the executions on the grounds that Iranian authorities had failed to produce definitive evidence of the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s responsibility for the deaths of two members of the Basij paramilitary force and a law enforcement officer on 16 November. Families and supporters held nightly vigils outside the Dastgerd prison in Isfahan in support of the three men who were being held inside. They were given a final meeting with their families on Wednesday, raising fears that their execution was imminent. Immediately after their execution on Friday, state media re-ran video posts of what were presented as the defendants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confessions, which Amnesty International said had been extracted by torture. At least seven people have been hanged in relation to the protest movement that swept Iran in September, and dozens more have been sentenced to death or convicted of capital offences. The latest executions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must have serious consequences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Tehran or dozens of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other protesters will be in danger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of the Norway-based group Iran Human Rights (IHR). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must make the Islamic republic leaders understand that execution of protesters will not be tolerated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote on Twitter. Hengaw, another Norway-based rights group, decried what it described as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfathomable wave of executions in Iran\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The nationwide protests that began last autumn have turned into one of the boldest challenges to the clerical leadership since the 1979 revolution. They were ignited by the death of the 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini while in the custody of Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s morality police on 16 September. Prominent Iranian figures including the actor Taraneh Alidoosti \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who was herself jailed for a few weeks in December for publishing a photograph of herself without a hijab \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the footballer Ali Karimi had expressed their concern about the three men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fate. Rallies in support of them had been held in Berlin, London and Stockholm. A video showing a group of mothers from the western city of Sanandaj condemning the death sentences was shared on social media. On Wednesday, a Twitter account published handwritten notes by the men appealing for public support. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let them kill us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd read one note, which went viral on social media. Friends of the families of the men said one of them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Kazemi \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had been suspended upside down by interrogators and shown a video of his brother being tortured. Kazemi was also allegedly subjected to mock executions at least 15 times. In an audio message recorded inside Dastgerd prison, Kazemi said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I swear to God I am innocent. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any weapons on me. They [security forces] kept beating me and ordering me to say this weapon is mine \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I told them I would say whatever they wanted, just please leave my family alone. I did whatever they wanted because of the torture.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kazemi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister said in an interview with the Shargh newspaper before the executions: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We demand to see evidence. They should present evidence that shows my brother was present at the time of the murder. The only evidence in this case is statements by others; one says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI heard from someone that it was Majid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and another says that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBahmani told us that Majid was there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t intend to cause trouble,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are neither against the supreme leadership [Iranian government] nor anyone else. We just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want our brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blood to be unjustly spilled.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At least 582 people were executed in Iran last year, the highest number since 2015 and well above the 333 recorded in 2021, IHR and the Paris-based group Together Against the Death Penalty said in a joint report in April. More than 220 people had already been executed this year, IHR said recently.

In the public consciousness, they were giant, scaly beasts with huge claws and teeth who spent their days chasing down victims and ripping them apart in brutal fashion. Think dinosaur and you will probably picture a primal, primitive force of unbelievable fury. And then along comes the new series of Prehistoric Planet (Apple TV+), which, in a single instant, undoes almost everything we thought we knew. The instant in question concerns the Hatzegopteryx: a vast, vicious-looking, giraffe-sized pterosaur. Had the Hatzegopteryx been depicted on screen at any point until now, it would undoubtedly have been to swoop down like a monster and gobble up its prey. But Prehistoric Planet shows us something different. It shows us Hatzegopteryx\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mating ritual, which may qualify as one of the most beautiful things you will ever see. A male carefully arranges various naturally occurring trinkets around himself on the spit of an island and gently starts dancing, eyes never leaving the sky, in the vain hope that a female might pass overhead and take interest. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heartbreaking, lovelorn and gorgeous to watch. Hatzegopteryx \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who knew? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nothing is primitive about dinosaurs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Tim Walker, Prehistoric Planet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s series producer, over a video call. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lone hunters or killers. They were really social and they would have been really flamboyant because of the social mindset. Our mission, if you like, was to show the audience that these are not mindless monsters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The second series marries two irresistibly compelling forces: MPC, the visual effects house that helped Jon Favreau create his photorealistic remakes of The Lion King and The Jungle Book; and BBC Studios Natural History Unit. The results of this union are astonishing. You have all the respect and scientific rigour that you would find in a traditionally shot documentary such as Planet Earth presented with thoroughly convincing CGI. After a while, you stop noticing that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not real-life footage. Part of this is down to the producers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach to what they depict. Mike Gunton, a Natural History Unit mainstay and the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive producer, says their approach stems from the horrifying sequence in Planet Earth II where an iguana hatchling runs for its life from dozens of speeding snakes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason that sequence felt so powerful was because it felt uncontrived,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Gunton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was very much: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOh my God, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that was going to happen!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re definitely copying that feeling here. The CGI can do anything, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to make it feel as if we turned up to shoot one thing, but then: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOh my God! Look at this!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried to shoot and edit as if it were found footage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This approach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c treat the camera as if it had been placed by a flesh-and-blood documentarian \u00e2\u20ac\u201c plays out through the series. There are T rex sequences, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect any extreme closeups. When we see a T rex, Gunton explains, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s depicted as being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty much shot on the longest telephoto lens in our armoury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to stop the camera operator from being eaten. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a subtle difference, but I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a critical one in terms of authenticity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Speaking of authenticity, Prehistoric Planet presents itself with the swaggering confidence of any Natural History Unit project. What we see, we are told, is how it is. That seems like a tall order, especially when making a show set millions of years ago based on data that is constantly developing. I ask Walker how the team managed to land on what to create for the series. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everything starts with the fossil record,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our baseline. The show is set 66m years ago. So, if you look at the fossil record, what was around? Not just the big dinosaurs, but everything else that lived alongside. All animals have got to perform a suite of behaviours. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all got to mate, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all got to eat. All this will be dictated partly by what type of animal they are and what their environments are like. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a combination of the fossil record, then the experience of wildlife film-makers who have observed animals in the field. And so you can start to bring all these different disciplines together, marry them with the CGI, and you build the plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This new view of dinosaurs takes some getting used to. When I first heard of Prehistoric Planet, my reaction was to write it off as a slightly jazzier version of Walking With Dinosaurs. After all, these animals are many millions of years old. What more could we have learned in the space of a couple of decades? Quite a lot, it turns out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a weekly scene meeting with our production team,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Walker. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our lead scientific consultant, Darren Naish, is part of that team. Each week, we have Dr Darren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dino Download, in which he gives us the latest news from palaeontology world, and we have to guess how many new dinosaurs have been described. On average, each year, over the last couple of years, a new dinosaur has been described every week.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That is a lot of new dinosaurs, I say. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who knew that palaeontology was such a fast moving science?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Walker replies, with a grin. In fact, Prehistoric Planet has even helped to nudge our understanding of dinosaurs forwards a little further. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mosasaur sequence, where we show it jumping out of the water,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Walker. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The team that we were working with didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fully know how the mosasaur could propel itself as fast as we show it. And so they set about doing a bit of academic work to find out the velocity that this particular type of animal could achieve.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gunton adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They knew the mosasaur was an ambush predator. But they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure how it could generate the thrust to accelerate at such speed. They had some suspicions, so they formulated a calculation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look, here it is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Walker, palpably giddy as he holds up his phone and shows me a mathematical formula that takes up his entire screen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is extraordinary scholarship here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Gunton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every single minute, every single second, is underpinned by serious and deep scientific interpretation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the things that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re super-proud of. The science and the reality of how you shoot this forces you into a position where it feels true. And we know from watching documentary, the truth of the world is always more engaging than something that we make up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Realism was less important in terms of the CGI, however. The series may be consistently breathtaking, but, to sell it to viewers, Gunton and Walker found themselves having to pare it back. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of the photography that we can now do in the real world, and that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re currently doing with Planet Earth III, is insane,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Gunton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But if we did that in Prehistoric Planet it would look wrong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a conversation we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had with Jon Favreau. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dialled down the photography, because otherwise it would have looked like a VFX show. The footage here feels more akin to what we were filming maybe eight years ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really weird mind game to play.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another thing that helps to sell the show, of course, is the participation of Sir David Attenborough, who not only narrates but also presents several sequences to camera. He is such a warm and reassuringly authoritative presence that you sense the producers could have staged a CGI dinosaur dance sequence and Attenborough would be able to convince you that it was scientifically accurate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not bad for 96,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Gunton of his longtime collaborator. Attenborough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation was not a done deal, however. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was very assiduous,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Gunton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If he was going to do this, then it had to be the last word on the matter. And it had to be all about authenticity. No fantasy. I remember the day we first showed him footage; he sat there watching on the computer, tapping his fingers. When it finished he turned to me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so theatrical \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he paused. Eventually, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how you could have done it any better.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 He works on the scripts.

As Jacob Marx Rice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play proceeds to commemorate each loved one who dies during Graciela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life, the suspense \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and rising death toll \u00e2\u20ac\u201c momentarily evokes an Agatha Christie thriller. Yet the only mystery is the eternal one: not whodunnit but what happens afterwards. In a cast of five, Vivia Font skilfully plays Graciela from preschooler to octogenarian, ageing affectingly. One minute she is a boisterous child, the next a brittle teen, face-palming at mum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortifying behaviour. The script subtly parallels scenes from her childhood and adulthood, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moving to see the daughter become a parent.

The difference here is that, despite a cosy setup that seats actors among the front row as if in a family room, the play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grand sweep and high concept sometimes keep us at a remove. The play is staged with sensitivity by Alex Howarth but as Graciela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family grows over the decades you lose the sense of interior lives that marked Howarth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart-rending (and less sentimental) Cassie and the Lights. A recurring ritual marks deaths through communal moments of song and snapshots (part of Rachel Sampley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s video design) shown on a gauze that also, less successfully, represents \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the other side\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Accessible to buggies, wheelchairs and walking sticks, the Kibble is a place to meet, escape the rain, get a wee warm up, say hello to a stranger, watch the world go by. It has always been free to do so since it opened to the public in 1873.

There are tourists admiring the orchid collection, photography students and sketching retirees. The painter Andrew Cranston is lingering by the fish pool. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another erosion of civic space,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone needs space to dream in, to stand and stare and not have to spend money.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some people say this is middle-class griping,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he adds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Botanics is situated in Glasgow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largely affluent West End \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total nonsense.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cranston points out the proximity of less-well-off neighbourhoods such as Maryhill and Partick, and the way that the Kibble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s informality of entry attracts visitors from across the city. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve no objection to giving donations when you can, but charging entry is nonsensical,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sheila Penny, a nanny who has been bringing children to the Kibble for 25 years. Glasgow city council estimates that proposed charges of \u00c2\u00a33 for adults and \u00c2\u00a31.50 for children could raise about \u00c2\u00a3185,000 annually, and says its budget \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aimed to protect services and jobs where ever possible and has looked to deal with the funding gap by raising revenue where we can\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just another attack on common space,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sapna Agarwal, referring to recent cuts to library opening hours in the city. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Society is becoming more fragmented and people are struggling in so many different ways.

The Darling Buds of May was filmed around here. You can imagine Miss Marple keeping an eye out through one of the cottage windows. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the kind of place that could win village of the year. Pluckley, a picture-postcard village with secrets \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something else \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Come out of Pluckley station and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hear the squeak of a sign swinging in the breeze. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be the Victorian-era hunting lodge turned award-winning pub the Dering Arms. Cycle six minutes into Pluckley proper and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come to St Nicolas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 church, a 900-year-old building set among silent winding lanes and fields. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home to the White Lady (said to haunt the vault where she was buried some 500 years ago), the Red Lady, who roams the churchyard, little white dog at her feet, and another 10 or so other ghosts. Welcome to the most haunted village in Britain. Our home for the weekend, Romden Barn, is a quick cycle ride from the station, and we went via the Pluckley farm shop with its hyper-local sparkling wine, honey and heritage tomatoes. My partner Lorin and I only learned of the area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ghostly reputation when a neighbour mentioned it the following day \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just as we were setting off to check out the ruins of a 12th-century church. Not afraid of a friendly ghost or two, we proceeded with our plans \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 While the churches may be a little on the spooky side, the barn, nestled between Pluckley and Smarden, is stunning. Straight out of Grand Designs, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all exposed beams, lofty ceilings, bright rooms and so much space. Sleeping at least six, it plays host to everything from big family birthday parties and friendly reunions to couples\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 getaways for those of us who live in tiny flats the rest of the time. Romden is a traditional barn with all mod cons Keen runners, we had come for a weekend at Romden to finish off the last of our marathon training \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mapping out a simple route that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d take us through local points of interest while taking in as much greenery as possible. We wanted to stay somewhere that was accessible by public transport, where we could store bikes and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most importantly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had facilities for winding down and relaxing post-run. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough work, clocking up the miles every weekend, especially when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re treading the same towpaths and parkrun routes. The plan was to take a fast train down from London on the Friday evening, head out on a long Saturday run somewhere entirely new, cycle to the local shops for provisions, and then spend the rest of the weekend luxuriating in the barn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot tub with a glass (or five) of local fizz. Saturday dawned bright and sunny, and we jogged through Smarden towards St Mary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (the site of the aforementioned ruins). Every turn we made, we were greeted with another breathtaking vista or Instagram-worthy scene. On the picturesque, winding lanes, drivers are so used to cyclists, ramblers and runners, that they give all slower-moving traffic a terrifically wide berth. And, mercifully, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come across Pluckley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resident spectral highwayman or phantom coach and horses on our jog either. Calling it quits at 11 miles, we grabbed our bikes and pedalled to the farm shop for brunch provisions: vinegary Kent crisps, slabs of local bacon, fresh eggs, soft sourdough, tangy chutney \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cold wine. As the Aga warmed up back at Romden, we indulged our inner Wim Hofs by stripping off and taking a plunge in the barn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cold-water pond \u00e2\u20ac\u201c deep breathing amid the water boatmen before dashing to the hot tub to warm back up. A full English has never tasted so good. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to explore the area on two wheels, with many destinations in cycling range There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to do around the area with a bike \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all of which is carefully noted in a bumper binder curated by Romden Barn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners, who are cyclists too and pedal a daily route around the villages. As well as going to every trouble to make the barn as comfortable as possible, including leaving us a bottle of fizz and a delicious, local pink apple juice, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done their damnedest to make your experience of Kent a memorable one. Leeds Castle is an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cycle north, while Sissinghurst (arguably the best gardens in England) is about 45 minutes away. The seaside at Rye takes just over 90 minutes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c slightly longer than the cycle to the National Trust\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Scotney Castle. And of course, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got plenty of pubs around. Cycle up to the Rose &amp; Crown at Mundy Bois before checking out the Black Horse in Pluckley (which is next to the haunted church). Then head over to the Bell in Smarden (built in the 1500s) and finish in the Flying Horse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enjoying a pint and looking on to the lush fields that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take you back home. Of course, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all assuming you actually manage to leave Romden Barn. After our full English, we found it too difficult to ignore the draw of the whirlpool bath, huge beds, Sky box and the hot tub. Lounging at Romden, surrounded by fields and birdsong with a cup of tea, we achieve real peace \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and not a ghost in sight.

Jones was entitled to have a testimonial after a decade at the club but, aware of the frustrations that have surrounded his continued presence while not actually being present at first-team training for a year, turned it down, reportedly joking: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Apart from my mum and dad, who else would turn up?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been very difficult, the last couple of years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jones admitted in his farewell to United. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no denying that.

I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to sign and, most of all, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to get started. There was only one club where I wanted to continue my journey in the game. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To wear this shirt, even just once, to wear this badge and represent everyone associated with it, has been an honour.

Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s show this Marine \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got his back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DeSantis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tweet also included a link to Penny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fundraiser. Vivek Ramaswamy, a businessman seeking the Republican presidential nomination, donated $10,000 to the Penny fundraiser. He retweeted his likely primary rival DeSantis, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I agree with this. Just donated. More of us should. We must restore the rule of law in America.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ramaswamy, listing some of Neely\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past criminal offenses, said that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never faced real justice for terrorizing New Yorkers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and blamed Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg. The fatal encounter unfolded when Neely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who had struggled with homelessness and mental illness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c walked on to a Manhattan subway train car shouting that he was tired, hungry and ready to die. A video recorded by a freelance journalist captured riders holding Neely against the floor. Penny kept Neely in a chokehold long after Neely stopped moving and at least one rider implored him to release the man. Police officials found Neely unconscious, and he was pronounced dead at hospital. The city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s medical examiner deemed Neely\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death a homicide. While police officers detained Penny and questioned him after the incident, they quickly released him, spurring public outcry and intense scrutiny over that decision. Bragg later announced that Penny would be arraigned on a second-degree manslaughter charge and he surrendered to police on Friday. He appeared in court shortly thereafter and was released on $100,000 bail. The Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz echoed similar pro-Penny sentiments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSubway Superman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Daniel Penny is a HERO,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gaetz tweeted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today, I will personally be donating to his legal defense fund on GiveSendGo.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kid Rock, an American rap-rock musician who has become an adamant Donald Trump booster, was among Penny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top supporters, donating $5,000. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Penny is a hero. [Manhattan district attorney] Alvin Bragg is a POS. Kid Rock,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the singer, who rose to fame in the late 1990s with Bawitdaba, said in a message. Charlie Kirk, who founded the powerful conservative student organization Turning Point USA, similarly issued a call to action. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please consider supporting Daniel Penny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal fund against NYC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unjust prosecution. Even if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acquitted of criminal charges, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll likely face a civil trial, so give what you can,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kirk tweeted. Jenna Ellis, an attorney who served as a senior adviser to Trump, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Support Daniel Penny!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her tweet included three American flag emojis. Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner who last week was found liable of sexual abuse, surprisingly did not offer concrete commentary on Penny. He did, however, demonize Neely while admitting he had seen no recording of the incident. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, I think he was in great danger and the other people in the car were in great danger. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the tape,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said in an interview with the Messenger that was published on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I think he was in danger. And it sounded like the other people in the car were in danger. And it also looks like [Neely] was arrested over 40 times and had lots of problems.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the tapes. I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a definitive [statement] but it looks to me like the people in that car were in great danger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Attorney Ron Kuby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who represented one of the Black teens whom white subway gunman Bernhard Goetz shot nearly four decades ago in an incident that also became a flashpoint in culture war discourse on crime and vigilantism, said the tenor of conversation around Neely wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unique. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When Bernard Goetz opened fire on four teenagers riding on a train he too became the celebrated everyman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c every white man \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had enough by the right wing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kuby said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not new, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hard to explain. Your Penny is a white Marine, and his victim was a mentally ill, homeless \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 queer Black man. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the agenda of white supremacy playing out right there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/19/monsters-a-fans-dilemma-by-claire-dederer-review-beauty-and-the-beast", "primaryCategory": "books", "title": "Monsters: A Fan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dilemma by Claire Dederer review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c beauty and the beast", "lead": "Is it OK to love the art of a morally repugnant artist?", "author": "Kathryn Hughes", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T10:00:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035944", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d2105d073e286eca4aaf13062ffbc61076e967c9/403_0_2258_1355/500.jpg", "body": "Is it OK to love a film, a book or a painting if its maker turns out to be a bad person? Not just lovable aw-shucks everyday bad, the sort who forgets to pick the kids up because he or she is too busy making art, but someone whose behaviour is immoral, illegal or both? A monster, in fact. This is the dilemma that Claire Dederer addresses in this exhilarating, gnarly inquiry into the business of separating the author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repugnant life from his or her magnificent work. It is hardly a new topic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the middle of the last century, the proponents of New Criticism were arguing about what they called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biographical fallacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and duly concluding that the critic should set aside an artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life and concentrate on their work alone. But then, Dederer points out tartly, they would say that, wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they? As mostly elite white men, these critics were naturally inclined to hand out free passes to others for the kind of bad behaviour with which they were themselves on intimate terms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c parental absence, alcoholic indulgence and that impregnable self-regard that inflicts collateral damage on everyone else. Seventy years on, and the problem of what to do about great art by horrible people has roared back, taking on slightly different flavours in this age of #MeToo and social media \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cancellation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. These days Dederer finds herself wondering if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever OK to enjoy reruns of The Cosby Show and what to do about Picasso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Les Demoiselles d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Avignon, with its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot pink bodies and its grimly animal faces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Can we listen to Michael Jackson if we stick to the stuff he made in his prepubescent Jackson 5 days? Although, wait a moment, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t he being horribly exploited as a child worker at that point? Does that make it better or worse? And most crucially of all for Dederer, who spent her early career as a film critic, how do we solve a problem like Roman Polanski? When she rewatches Chinatown, his Oscar-winning masterpiece from 1974, is she tacitly condoning his statutory rape of a 13-year-old school girl just three years later? Polanski is a particularly knotty case, says Dederer, because his own biography is the stuff of nightmares. His mother died in Auschwitz and his pregnant wife Sharon Tate was murdered by the Manson \u00e2\u20ac\u0153family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in 1969. Trying to weigh Polanski\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trauma against the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of his later criminality makes your head hurt, which is why Dederer finds herself wishing for a moral calculator that would do this kind of thinking for her. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d punch in all the salient biographic details and, hey presto, the machine would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spit out a verdict\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as to whether or not it is OK to carry on looking at Picasso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bashed-up renditions of his many mistresses or bop along to Michael Jackson when I Want You Back comes on the radio. The impulse to farm out the decision to an external authority sounds hopelessly naive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but then, asks Dederer, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there something equally ridiculous about thinking that whether we choose to enjoy a particular piece of art or not is going to change anything? That we might be able to ameliorate the harm of Polanski\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s violation of a schoolgirl or Picasso burning the face of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153muse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fran\u00c3\u00a7oise Gilot with a cigarette? Far more productive, she suggests, is for us to start being honest about our own monstrosity. Indeed, she believes that until we accept our own capacity for bad behaviour then we are stuck in the worst of all worlds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c denying ourselves the satisfaction of consuming art that moves us in ways we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite understand yet failing to get to grips with why we keep returning to it. To get things going, Dederer offers up her own monstrousness. She is a mother who is also a writer, which means that she has been guilty of negligence on those occasions when she has accepted invitations for residential fellowships which have taken her away from home for weeks at a time. Worse still, she has hugged herself with relieved glee while doing it. On top of this, she spent 10 years as a functioning alcoholic, which is not something that usually combines well with engaged and committed family life. Dederer doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go into details since this is not a confessional memoir and that is not the point. Instead she shows us her own monstrosity as a way of beginning to breakdown the imaginary cordon sanitaire we habitually draw around artists whose behaviour repels us. We can decide, in a panic of self-righteousness, to cast all their work aside and consign it to a cultural deep freeze. Or we can choose instead to keep it in full view, with gratitude and wonder that such saving beauty is still possible amid the moral grot in which we all live. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Monsters: A Fan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dilemma is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00c2\u00a320).

Welcome to Washington in the post-Trump era, as the United States stares down the barrel of debt default. The fate of the global economy now rests in the hands of the grown-ups inside the Biden administration and the tantrum-prone children who populate the House Republican caucus. This is not a fair fight. One side is happy to defecate on the floor. The other side has no choice but to clean up the mess. The spiritual leader of this crappy caucus is of course the man-child who has built an entire post-presidency from the grievances he blathers about every day. Freewheeling in front of a televised audience of his fans on CNN last week, Donald Trump displayed the kind of mastery of finance that has led to his multiple bankruptcies over the course of his dismal career of business failures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I say to the Republicans out there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c congressmen, senators \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give you massive cuts, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have to do a default,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the unindicted co-conspirator of an insurrection to overthrow the United States government. When pushed whether he really meant what he said about having to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do a default\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Trump just shrugged it all off. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, you might as well do it now because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it later,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he explained. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because we have to save this country. Our country is dying. Our country is being destroyed by stupid people, by very stupid people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one thing Trump and his Trumpy Republicans understand, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thinking of very stupid people. Who else would know that very stupid people are going to do something very stupid like a totally unnecessary default on sovereign debt? So you may as well get ahead of them by doing something very stupid like that yourself, sooner rather than later. To be clear, Trump and his Trumpy Republicans think this whole default thing is just some kind of brain fog. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really psychological more than anything else,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told CNN. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it could be very bad. It could be maybe nothing. Maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you have a bad week or a bad day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A bad week, a bad day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or even, and just hear me out here, a bad couple of generations. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happened last time the House Republicans drove the global economy to the edge of debt default, back in 2011 when President Obama was grappling with the Tea Party Republicans. The credit ratings agencies downgraded United States debt for the first time in 70 years, which ended up costing the government more money to sustain its debt. A brilliant outcome. To be clear, the debt ceiling debate is not about the grotesque size of federal spending. That is the budget debate, and both parties have enjoyed spending massive amounts of debt over many decades. The debt ceiling is a technical measure to decide whether the Congress \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which approved of those budgets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is going to pay its own bills. This is not a new crisis or even a fast-moving one. It is as predictably slow as it is gob-smackingly dumb. The United States actually reached its debt limit in January, around the time the Democrats handed over the House to the Republicans after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s congressional elections. Yes, they could have lifted the debt ceiling themselves, but decided to lob the grenade to the next Congress. So for the last four months, treasury officials have been shuffling around large pots of cash to stay within their limit of what is now a $31.4tn debt. Apparently we have not yet reached the gazillion phase of American borrowing. These financial shenanigans will exhaust themselves in all of two weeks, give or take a few days or weeks. Some Republicans have suggested that treasury could just pick and choose a few bills to leave unpaid. Those Republicans can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spell insolvent. Trump for one knows how this is going to play out. Not because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a genius, although clearly he thinks he is. But because he knows that only one side is going to behave like grown-ups and that side isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t his own. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to do a default because I think the Democrats will absolutely cave because you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to have that happen,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told CNN. That of course is what Obama did. And that is what Joe Biden has already indicated he will do. Earlier this week, Biden said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confident\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that there would be an agreement to avoid default. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to come together because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no alternative way to do the right thing for the country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to move on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd By \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he meant his own Democrats. The man on the other side of the Oval Office sofa was Kevin McCarthy, the catastrophically weak House speaker, whose majority \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and job \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rests on the internal monologues of just a handful of Trumpy Republicans. The side that needs to be house-trained is sadly, barely, in control of the House. If McCarthy loses just four or more of his own 222 members, he is doomed. Which means we are all doomed. Until recently, Democrats inside the White House and Congress have insisted on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bill to raise the debt ceiling. They abandoned that position this week, as Biden toyed with the idea of a bunch of budget cuts. Republicans want to see $4.8tn of cuts, mostly to stuff that only Democrats seem to care about, like feeding poor working families or dealing with the climate crisis. Democrats are witnessing the slow centrification of their own White House. Team Biden is preparing to junk the last two years of progressive policies in favor of some classic pandering to the right ahead of a tight presidential election. After trying to look tough on migrants on the southern border, they now want to look tough on spending \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially spending on social welfare. This is the kind of politics that inspires and satisfies nobody. McCarthy cannot win the debt ceiling battle because his Trumpy caucus thinks the cuts are not enough and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine to default. Biden cannot win because he is ready to dump his party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principles and priorities to avoid default and defeat next year. Somewhere in the middle of this, working families that need support will find there is less food each month and higher medical bills. But the debt default crisis will dissipate, until the next one, and most swing voters don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to worry about the people whose safety net is about to get shredded. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really psychological more than anything else.

The spring crops are established and the summer ones are finding their feet. The soft fruit plants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c raspberries, redcurrants and blackcurrants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are starting to swell while the self-sown nasturtiums, calendula and poached egg plant are beginning to take up more space. Every day, a harvest awaits. Leaves of punchy rocket and oak-leafed lettuce leaves for a salad with dinner, and rhubarb stems shucked from their crown and stewed for dessert. Putting in support structures for your plants is a pre-emptive act, a gesture made in the hope that your crops will flourish. So, since their growth is probably gathering pace, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait until your plants become unwieldy before giving them something to lean on as they grow. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be healthier for it, plus it makes harvest easier. For the climbing plants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c beans, cucumbers, squash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c structures or trellises made of willow, bamboo canes or hazel are simple to construct and sturdy. I favour the classic tripod \u00e2\u20ac\u201c three (or four) sticks pushed into the ground and tied together at the top into a pyramid shape. A similar structure can work for peas, but add netting or chicken wire, or weave twine around the structure for their more delicate tendrils to grab hold of. I once grew my climbing beans up a discarded rose arch I found and it was as beautiful as any clambering ornamental. In the tomato bed, stakes can be pushed into the ground an inch away from the indeterminate tomato plants and tied loosely to their stems; they will thicken as they grow upwards. Add more ties as the season progresses so plants can rely on the stake when they bear fruit. One of my priorities is to encourage the surrounding ecosystem to thrive by welcoming all the buzzing, crawling, singing creatures to join me in the garden. But another is to ensure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a crop to pick \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I use bird-proof netting to stop blackbirds eating all my soft fruit as it ripens and to stop pigeons stripping brassicas of their leaves. Insect-proof mesh can be deployed to keep flea beetles from peppering brassicas with holes, but in my experience it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more effective at preventing carrot root fly from laying eggs and producing the larvae that feed on the roots. Another horticultural material is shade netting. When growing in direct sun, especially in the heat of summer, lettuce plants have a tendency to bolt, rushing to produce flowers and seeds; this also makes the leaves less palatable. Shade netting can offer some protection and keep plants cropping for longer."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/may/19/15-tips-on-how-to-have-a-happy-holiday", "primaryCategory": "travel", "title": "Turn off your email, get the packing right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and never, ever play Monopoly: 15 tips for a happy holiday", "lead": "Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how to master the art of holidaying, whoever you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going away with", "author": "Jess Cartner-Morley", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T10:00:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035954", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cb735581a2fc8ea71e1276b86ebed11c630864e6/872_931_7098_4259/500.jpg", "body": "Spend your money on space rather than travel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All mammals get aggressive when crowded,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says clinical psychologist Linda Blair. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Save money on long-distance travel and invest instead in generously sized accommodation where you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be on top of each other.

Holidays are about spending time with people you care about, having new experiences and relishing life in all its authentic, messy glory. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sweat it. Know your audience Peace and isolation may be delicious to you but deathly dull to your kids. Granny might want to do the sights while you prefer kayaking. Or the other way around. The teenagers do not need to see the cathedral. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their holiday, too. Ditto going On A Walk, although \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pro tip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you call it a hike they are more likely to be enthusiastic. Remember that teenagers have a different circadian rhythm and genuinely need lie-ins. Be honest: do you actually like beaches? Sandy beaches look so pretty in photographs, but a lot of people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c me! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c find sand super annoying. An inland spot with a pool or near a river or lake might suit you better, and be cheaper. Also, do you really want full-on summer heat or would somewhere more temperate, where you can walk and explore without fainting, be better? The point is to think about what you actually want rather than passively scrolling Instagram, where holidays always look amazing. How active do you want to be? Are you a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high peak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no valley\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd holiday person? A high-peak holiday is all about exciting activities; a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no valley\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd break has no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd moments, and maximizes relaxation, fun and being pampered, even if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s little change from one day to the next. Do not buy sunglasses at the airport Nobody makes good retail choices in an airport, so this is not a good time to drop \u00c2\u00a3150 on designer shades just because you are overexcited and also deranged from getting up at 5am. The only things you should buy in an airport are forgotten toiletries, snacks or a fragrance you already love. If the plane is delayed, buy a \u00c2\u00a33 crossword book and some crisps. Give yourself permission to waste time \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Leisure can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be true leisure if you are constantly trying to make the most of it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Oliver Burkeman, author of Four Thousand Weeks: Time and How to Use It. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to learn to waste time in order to enjoy it. The holiday has cost you money and time \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it can get strangely joyless if you fixate on trying to visit all the sights, or if you think of your holiday as being about resting in preparation for working hard when you get home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For the first few days of a holiday, I am too restless to actually take it easy, so I pour my energy into doing recces of the area and local shops to stock up on wine and snacks until I wind down a bit. Clothes are the least important bit of packing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had a magical holiday thanks to my perfectly colour-coordinated capsule wardrobe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said literally no one ever. Holiday dressing is my favourite kind, and I own way more kaftans and cute sandals than I could ever need, but clothes are the least impactful element of your suitcase when it comes to making a holiday go right. Essentials are: Uno (the only card game everyone likes); aerosol-spray sunscreen that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take 20 minutes to rub in; an extra phone charger and two more plug adapters than you think you need; headphone splitters so two children can watch on the same screen; an insulated water bottle that will keep your water cool; and a bug-bite zapper (the best fiver you will ever spend in Boots). I have a friend who packs a portable wifi extender for Airbnbs with sketchy internet connection. Going as a couple? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t brand it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcromantic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Spa treatments for two, honeymoon-y tables on the beach \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Trying to be romantic all the time is likely to make you feel more self-conscious than sexy. Plan to have fun together instead of scheduling five days of staring into each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes. Pick a location based on a shared interest. If you both love food, go to San Sebasti\u00c3\u00a1n and wander the old town sampling pintxos. If you first bonded over your love of Wes Anderson, take your half-frame cameras on a train journey in search of picturesque European cities. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your first holiday together, somewhere new to both of you (definitely not somewhere either of you has been with an ex) is less loaded than somewhere one of you had a great time last year. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sweet that your new boyfriend wants to teach you to surf, but spending two days coughing up seawater is not sexy. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into a holiday rut Military historians say generals tend to fight the previous war \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and lose the next one as a result. If you are the holiday booker, you are the general, and a common trap is focusing too much on what went well and badly last summer and ending up with a holiday that would have been perfect a year ago. People can change a lot in a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c think about what you like doing now. Travelling with a little one? Take the buggy A pre-dinner stroll around town might buy you a meal in peace while they nap. Also, a piece of blackout lining that you can drape over flimsy holiday-home curtains is worth it not to be up at 6am. If you have small children, travelling light is a mug\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game. Manage the takeoff and landing By this I mean the first and last days. Blair says that rather than planning to catch up sleep while on holiday, you should aim to nap more than usual in the days before you leave. The extra sleep can help to prevent frayed tempers when you do get away. Burkeman advises planning to make your journey home as smooth as possible: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you think carefully about how to handle the end point, your holiday is more likely to stay in your memory as wonderful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Before you set off on holiday, figure out the journey home \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so download the train timetable, print the boarding passes and put a pint of milk in the freezer. Download a group-spending app Splitwise is a good one. You input what each person spends and it keeps a record, avoiding someone doing sums at the end of every dinner. If some of you have kids and some don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, or some drink and some don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, or some are on a tighter budget, chat about how to split costs before the holiday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c better that way than at the end of a dinner when someone ordered the lobster and everyone else is silently seething.On a family holiday, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overstretch yourselves financially then get frustrated with children for not being grateful. Children, bless them, are ungrateful little buggers by nature. Keep house visits short and sweet An invitation to stay in someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house is hugely generous. Just be mindful that you will need to sing for your supper. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really on to ignore your hosts while you snog on the sofa or sleep all day. A lavish gift isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t important; bringing good vibes is. Smiles and positive energy will get you invited back sooner than a Diptyque candle. Do not have an argument to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclear the air\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Your beloved can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow Google Maps so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve taken a 40-minute detour to the restaurant, and now your new espadrilles are rubbing and you are starving. Irritation is the most easily accessible emotion, but take a breath and remember how much you love the person who is driving you insane. Holiday rows have a habit of lingering in the memory. If one is rumbling, first, slow down on the alcohol. Talk about something else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c anything else \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for a bit. It takes about 20 minutes for strong emotions to dissipate, so chat about the menu and let the clouds pass over. Move email to the last page of your phone Not seeing that little envelope icon every time you pull out your phone makes a huge difference to being able to switch off. Make sure the person feeding your cat etc knows to WhatsApp you instead of emailing, and then put on an out-of-office. Be consistent: if you have said you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to respond to emails, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick up your phone and get involved in what is going on at the office. If you are renting a place, ask lots of questions Not sure if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done with a fisheye lens or witchcraft, but photos can be devilishly misleading. Ask as many tricky questions as possible, says Serena Cook, founder of Deliciously Sorted Ibiza. Is there shade around the pool? How big is the smallest bedroom? Is the garden overlooked? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They will tell you the good stuff, but you need to know the downsides too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Try to establish contact with the property owner before your holiday. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re your best source of local recommendations, and a good rapport can make things smoother if anything goes wrong. Be lazy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except about exercise Exercise works up an appetite for all that holiday eating, plus you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feel better about yourself when you get home, plus it will install good associations with exercise, which means you are more likely to keep the good habits up. Also, everyone needs some me-time, and a run or swim is perfect for this. If I am reading by the pool, leave me alone Try to divide up cooking, driving and childcare in a way that plays to everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strengths. I love to cook and am super happy to spend a chunk of the day planning, shopping for and making lunch. And hopefully there is someone who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hate playing stupid ball games with kids, because if you disturb me when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m having a lovely time with my new Curtis Sittenfeld novel, I may have to kill you. Field each player in his or her strongest position. Relax, delegate and let some things slide Two weeks spent making beds and hanging up wet towels is not a holiday even if you are in a bikini. Let some things slide. Tell kids to rinse their swim things in the shower with them and hang them out. Leave the heavy-going books at home and pack what you will enjoy. Tilt your face to the sun when you drink your first coffee of the day; take a nap in the shade when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hot. And never play Monopoly Ever. Even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s raining. Not unless you actively want to throw a hand grenade into the room."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/19/montana-tiktok-ban-user-reaction-influencer", "primaryCategory": "technology", "title": "Montana TikTok users denounce ban: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe have terrible roads but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re banning an app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122", "lead": "Young users question whether law tied to national security concerns will take effect in January as planned", "author": "Alaina Demopoulos", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T10:00:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035958", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c52277780d811305b0a5147e79c830fc2fa257db/38_559_3912_2346/500.jpg", "body": "On Wednesday, a 30-year-old influencer named Kylie Nelson signed a deal with TikTok to promote the app on her page. A few hours later, she learned that the state of Montana had passed a law banning TikTok. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wondering: what do we do here?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Nelson, who lives in Billings and is a full-time content creator. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153About 60% to 70% of my brand collaborations are with TikTok. So, yeah, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty bummed out by the news.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nelson has over 206,000 TikTok followers and estimates that she will make about $60,000 through her influencing this year. Since she quit her job to become a content creator, most of her income relies on the app\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existence. Lawmakers across the country have threatened to ban TikTok, but Montana became the first state to go through with the idea this week. Under the new rule, signed into law by the Republican governor, Greg Gianforte, mobile app stores are banned from offering the app to users starting next year. Nelson is skeptical that the law will go into effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banned when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually banned next January,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until then, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to talk with my talent agency and TikTok to come up with a full game plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is not just income Nelson stands to lose. Most of her posts give inspiration for mid-size fashion lovers, or people who fit into clothing larger than sizes 0-8 but smaller than a size 12. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the many niche groups that has found a platform on the app. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The very first thing I thought about when I heard of the ban was the community of women that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve built,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nelson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re supporting each other to feel confident in our clothes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company, and has come under scrutiny for its ties to the country. Politicians on both sides of the aisle, from the Biden administration to Donald Trump, have expressed concerns over national security and the potential of TikTok sharing user data with China. Christian W Poole, a 20-year-old from Bozeman, got his first 100,000 followers in high school by rating Montana towns on a scale from 1 to 10. (Lincoln and Virginia City were his top picks.) He now has 418,500 followers on the app, where he dubs himself \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the unofficial ambassador for the state of Montana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Poole said that his state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government had larger issues to tackle than TikTok. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so goofy to target them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have terrible infrastructure; last year we had massive flooding that took out bridges and roads. There are so many other issues that nobody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focusing on banning an entertainment app because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re afraid of China mining data that the US already mines itself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TikTok remains extraordinarily popular among young Americans; it has over 100 million users in the US. Representatives for TikTok told the AP that more than 200,000 people in Montana alone use the app. One day after the bill was signed, content creators front the state began posting under the hashtag #montanalovestiktok, which has been viewed over 68,000 times. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem like this bill has any support among the public,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Poole said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, maybe older audiences, and Governor Gianforte is pandering to them. The average person in Montana doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really care.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Poole will continue to use the app. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153TikTok is my favorite hobby,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It gets me some money, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t monetize it too much. I want to make people laugh and relate to me. If I lost the avenue to do that in January, that would suck, but right now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m focusing on what I have.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Under the law, users will not face any punishment for accessing TikTok, but app stores like Apple and Android, plus TikTok itself, would face a fine of $10,000 per day every time someone \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is offered the ability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to access or download the app. TikTok planned to challenge the law, which a spokesperson said violated first amendment rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to reassure Montanans that they can continue using TikTok to express themselves, earn a living, and find community as we continue working to defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the spokesperson said in a statement. One survey conducted by the website Casino.org asked over 2,000 Montana-based content creators whether they would continue to use the platform post-ban; 35% said they intended to. The users will have to circumvent the law by using VPNs or proxies to use the app, which would leave them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Nelson does not know what she will do if the law goes into effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The VPN thing is intriguing to me, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also a rule-follower, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have a hard time doing that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. As bans against TikTok ramp up, ByteDance has started to push Lemon8, its newer video and photo-sharing app. Nelson said she might move her content there. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is always going to be a new app that comes out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of like how Instagram faded out and TikTok came in. Maybe next up is Lemon8.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/19/houseplant-of-the-week-monkey-tail-cactus", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "title": "Houseplant of the week: monkey tail cactus", "lead": "Looking for a plant pet?

Shi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post was in reaction to the stiff punishment delivered to Li Haoshi, also known as House, over a joke about two dogs chasing a squirrel reminding him of one of Xi Jinping\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military slogan. After an audio recording of the joke went viral, Beijing police launched an investigation under a 2021 law which criminalised insulting China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military, the People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberation Army. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will never allow any company or individual use the Chinese capital as a stage to wantonly slander the glorious image of the PLA,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministry of culture and tourism bureau said.

On Tuesday, in a post that appears to have been taken down, Shi posted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why should HOUSE be banned? Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all soldier brothers just dog brothers?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Global Times reported she was put in administrative detention, which allows police to hold someone for up to 15 days without charge for a minor public order offence.

I feel like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m watching everything crumble before me \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to fake everything for so long.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sentencing him at Bristol crown court, Mrs Justice Cutts told Schofield: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You exploited his innocence for your own sexual gratification.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said the complainant thought he had to do what Schofield wanted because he was worried about his temper. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He felt forced to do what you wanted, trapped and unable to escape. He felt he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell anyone and did not do so for many years. You took away his ability to be the teenager he should have been: carefree, relaxed, happy. You became utterly obsessed with him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your actions have had a devastating impact. You thought only of yourself. I have not heard a word of genuine remorse, only self-pity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Grey-haired and bearded, Schofield shook his head and appeared tearful during the judge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sentencing remarks. Schofield was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child, three of causing a child to engage in sexual activity, three of causing a child to watch sexual activity and three of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child. The offences took place between October 2016 and October 2019. The court was told that some of the pornography was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extreme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and involved violence. Robin Shellard, prosecuting, said aggravating factors included a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant degree of planning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the fact that he gave the complainant alcohol to make him more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153malleable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Peter Binder, defending, said Schofield had no previous convictions and described his client as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153socially isolated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply troubled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To his eternal shame he lost semblance of a moral compass,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the barrister said. A jury at Exeter crown court was told the offences emerged after the complainant was persuaded to see two counsellors and revealed what had happened. The police were alerted and Schofield was arrested within 48 hours at his home in Bath. Schofield was based at Avon and Somerset police headquarters and was suspended from duty in December 2021 when the allegations were first made. Following his convictions, a misconduct hearing took place and he was dismissed without notice. In a statement issued after the verdicts last month, Phillip Schofield said he was disowning his brother. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are despicable crimes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As far as I am concerned, I no longer have a brother.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If any crime had ever been confessed to me by my brother, I would have acted immediately to protect the victim and their family.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Det Insp Keith Smith of Avon and Somerset police said the offences committed by Schofield were not connected to his employment with the police as an IT worker but the fact he was a member of staff will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153of great concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the public. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to be absolutely clear, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a mission to root out all those who betray the standards and values we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re committed to uphold. The public must be able to trust police officers and staff, and protecting this bond of trust is our priority.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesperson for the UK children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charity NSPCC said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The victim in this case has shown real courage in coming forward to report what happened and giving evidence in court, and we hope he is receiving all the support he needs to help him move on with his life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/19/do-football-teams-with-nothing-to-play-for-really-end-up-on-the-beach", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Do football teams with nothing to play for really end up \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcon the beach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122?", "lead": "As crunch time arrives for some clubs and others have nothing but pride at stake, we examine how likely focus is to falter", "author": "Michael Butler", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T09:40:55Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035976", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a0a689d97fc548f657ac8f8c243e8c3ef5e83495/0_79_5646_3390/500.jpg", "body": "You may have noticed that Napoli swept to their first Scudetto in 33 years this month with five matches remaining. You may not have noticed that the newly crowned champions lost 2-0 at promoted Monza last weekend. With the title secured, no European campaign to worry about and no record points tally to chase or international manager to impress for this summer, could Napoli\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s players (and staff) be accused of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the beach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Defined loosely as downing tools, the theory is not confined to football \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as any teacher with a VHS in their hand at the end of term will attest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but with a few vital and not-so-vital matches left of the season, this is the area of most interest. Despite the arguments of some fans grumbling on the way to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s penultimate round of Premier League fixtures, the reality is that being on the beach is a myth. There is simply too much to be gained, or lost, from a player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motivation not being what it should be. Data is king and, with all the performance gadgets and dozens of cameras homed in on every turn and sprint, it becomes patently obvious if a player is not giving his all. The transfer market is ruthless and managers can bump an underwhelming player out of the team quicker than you can say Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Contracts and even goal bonuses are too lucrative for somebody not to give a monkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Harry Redknapp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career as a player and a manager stretches back to the mid-60s, and he will be in the dugout again on Saturday for a charity match at Loftus Road for the Kiyan Prince Foundation. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been his side or his opponents, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been in plenty of situations where a team could be said to be on the beach Redknapp feels this is a nonsense. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Premier League players are fully focused,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the 76-year-old says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They train hard, 99% are not drinkers, they look after themselves. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too much at stake and the crowd are not going to stand for it. When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got 40,000 people screaming at you, giving you abuse if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put a shift in, how can you go out and not try? Quite often, they play better in games where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing to play for, because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no pressure. I remember when I was at Southampton in 2004-05, in a relegation battle with Norwich, and they got beat 6-0 by Fulham, who were mid-table.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are countless examples to disprove the rule of being on the beach and Redknapp was involved in one of the most notable. On the final day of the 1994-95 season, Manchester United needed a win at Redknapp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mid-table West Ham to have any hope of the title. With rivals Blackburn drawing at Liverpool the door opened for Manchester United. All they needed was a win at the Hammers, but a sensational defensive display denied Sir Alex Ferguson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side, even though Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son Jamie scored a fine free-kick to beat Blackburn 2-1. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was some day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Redknapp says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A great day for football. I brought another centre-back on, with 15 minutes to go, and Fergie got the hump with me. I strung five across the back, and we were keeping them out at all costs. We worked our socks off that day. Ludek Miklosko was great, wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t he? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were delighted. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think about Man United. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not there to help Man United \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bothered if they won the league or not. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there to get a result for West Ham give the fans a good last day of the season.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another one. Tottenham won at [Manchester] City to qualify for the Champions League in 2009-10. A few days later, we went to Burnley, went 2-0 up but got beat 4-2. I gave them the biggest bollocking they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever had in their life. We had nothing to play for, but you want to win.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Standards have risen in the Premier League because the players\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lifestyles have become sanitised. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that players live relatively boring lives. Players go to bed on time, hire private chefs, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out. Professionalism reigns. Slogans such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153FAIL TO PREPARE, PREPARE TO FAIL\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are tattooed on to arms, or inscribed on walls at the training ground. Anyone who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t adhere to the strict guidelines is run out of town. There can, however, be external factors. At this stage of the season, teams can easily be weakened by injuries or managers choosing to rest players for a cup tie. Often at this stage a few players are worried about picking up a knock before a European Championship or World Cup. Lots of things can affect a player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment, but it is a more random, sporadic set of reasons than a broad trend of players not trying. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of it is the luck of the draw,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Redknapp says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You may play a team that is involved in a cup competition. David Moyes had a semi-final in Europe this week so he rested most of his West Ham team at Brentford, and they got beat. So you can certainly strike lucky on the run-in. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather play a team that is a distracted than one that has nothing to play for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fans of Manchester City and Brighton may be pleased their teams are facing Chelsea (who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finish higher than 10th) and Southampton (already relegated) respectively on Sunday. But City and Brighton will likely win not because their opponents are on the beach. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably more to do with the fact Chelsea and Saints are just not very good."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/19/corleone-the-sicilian-town-trying-to-break-free-of-its-mobster-past", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Corleone: the Sicilian town trying to break free of its mobster past", "lead": "Mood is changing in town that spent half a century terrorised into silence under mafia bosses", "author": "Lorenzo Tondo in Corleone.

It would be difficult to imagine that for almost half a century it was the stronghold of the mafia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bloodiest and most powerful clan, and the fiefdom of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most feared mobster, Tot\u00c3\u00b2 Riina. Immortalised in cinema and literature by The Godfather, it became synonymous with organised crime, even if the bosses who once governed it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Riina, Luciano Leggio and Bernardo Provenzano \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are now dead. But, tired of dealing with a name that has become a curse, Corleone is struggling to escape its mobster past. The local government last week voted for a resolution demanding the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153swift removal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of Giuseppe Salvatore Riina, 46, the third-born of the former boss of bosses, who returned in April after eight years in jail for extortion, money laundering and mafia association. The resolution describes Riina Jr as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwelcome fellow citizen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, whose family caused \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reputational damage to the city\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The mayor, Nicol\u00c3\u00b2 Nicolosi, said the local government had decided to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sound an alarm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though the ultimate decision rested with magistrates in Palermo or even the national government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Riina Jr, once back in town, was welcomed with a cordial attitude by the people and this a dangerous sign in a period where the community was finally moving on, leaving its mafia past behind. The truth is that most of them are being polite because they still fear him. The reality is that they are tired of him and his family,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes people point out to me that the person next to me at the bar was related to Provenzano or Riina,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Dario Triolo, whose father, Ugo Triolo, a lawyer, was murdered by the mafia in 1978. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the truth is, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel anything for these people. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give a damn about them. If I had feelings for them, I would have ruined my life. But if you ask me what I think of Riina Jr, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll tell you I wish he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in Corleone. Why is he back?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When the American writer Mario Puzo decided that the fictional protagonist of his 1969 novel would be called Vito Corleone, and that the town of the same name would be his home town, Corleone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious young gangsters had already put it on the map. In the 1970s, when the first two films of the Godfather trilogy were released, Tot\u00c3\u00b2 Riina began his rise to power. His leadership marked a new level of violence: not only did he assassinate his criminal rivals on an unprecedented scale, he also targeted anyone who sought to stand in his way. He is believed responsible for hundreds of deaths. The impact on Corleone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation was devastating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When in the postwar period the carabinieri general Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa, who was sent to Sicily to fight the mafia, arrived in Corleone, he immediately ordered a census of all the families who lived there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Nicolosi. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He discovered that every single family in Corleone had a relative within the Cosa Nostra clan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For half a century, the people of Corleone had lived in a kind of mafia fiefdom, where they were terrorised into obedient silence. When the local paper in the 1980s suggested a link between the mafia and a local political figure, its office was firebombed. Nicolosi says it was only after the 2006 arrest of Riina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor, Provenzano, that people began to express their opinions freely. Decimated by relentless arrests, short on cash and on foot soldiers, today the Sicilian mafia has been weakened, and even in Corleone the atmosphere is different. The main square is dedicated to the judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, whose killings had been ordered by Riina, while a gigantic mural of Francesca Morvillo, Falcone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, who was killed with him in 1992, stands out on a school wall. Houses seized from the mafia were turned into hostels and recreational centres for young people, even a police station. And yet, even today, it is not difficult to meet residents, especially among the old generation, who consider Riina a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good man\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why the mayor wants Riina out of the town,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the owner of a bar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is his home town.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Some in the town have exploited mafia stereotypes to attract tourists, such as a cafe transformed into a kind of Godfather film museum, with dozens of posters featuring Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, although the film was not shot in the town. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes tourists pose in front of a church, convinced that it is where the marriage between Mike Corleone and Apollonia was celebrated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Liborio Grizzafi, who manages the Intus project in Corleone, aimed at promoting anti-mafia education. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I explain to them that the film was never shot here, they tell me: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDude, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell me that, I came from Colombia only for this reason.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Riina Jr said he felt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153persecuted, oppressed, harassed and targeted for everything he does\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after the local authorities allegedly refused to renew his ID. The day after the council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to vote for his removal from the town, the son of the boss posted a message on Facebook in which he criticised the authorities and promoted his 2016 book, Riina Family Life, bragging about selling foreign rights. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While in Corleone they discuss meaningless things like taking me away from home, I continue to achieve new success,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. The post has garnered hundreds of likes and comments, many from young people in Corleone, expressing affection for his family. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem is, on one hand, the older citizens who struggle to disengage from the past, and a part of the new generations who continue to be fascinated by Cosa Nostra,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Giuseppe Cipriani, who was mayor for almost 10 years. When the son of a boss like Riina returns to a town like Corleone, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never a good sign. Investigators fear that he could try to reorganise the clan, which still today can count on an army of mafiosi in the city. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Riina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return takes place at a delicate moment for Corleone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Marilena Bagarella, manager of the Laboratory of Legality, a sort of anti-mafia museum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Attention on the mafia is waning. And this is a problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She says that a revival of the clan in the town would be a catastrophe, especially for the young people who are finally and increasingly aware of how negative the mafia is for their future. She often gives lessons to her students in which she recounts the battles fought against the mafia by heroes like Placido Rizzotto, a trade union leader murdered in 1948. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the past, students who belonged to a family linked to the mafia did not show up for these lessons,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But lately some mothers have secretly brought their children. They ask us not to say publicly who they are because they fear the wrath of their husbands. But the fact that they bring them here is already a great revolution in a city like Corleone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marilena is related to Leoluca Bagarella, one of the most ruthless killers of Cosa Nostra and brother of Ninetta, Tot\u00c3\u00b2 Riina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife. When the students ask Marilena about that relationship, she tells them: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter what surname you bear, what matters is the path you choose.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She shares a story: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One day, while I was explaining the importance of making one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choices freely in life, a child, very excited, got up from his chair and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThen there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope for me, too.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if he was related to the boss, but his surname was Riina.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\u2122"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/19/father-doesband-children-dads-younger", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "Can we call time on the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdoesband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 doing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdaddy day care\u00e2\u20ac\u2122?

There are more and more female breadwinners, but according to the Office for National Statistics, women still do 60% more unpaid work than men. Walker writes about staying awkwardly silent during conversations with other women about their useless partners. It can feel like boasting to go into just how much your male partner does (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m only discussing heterosexual relationships here). Since having a baby, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been depressed by how little some men seem to get away with doing when it comes to their own children, and how normalised that is. Take the loathsome phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Daddy daycare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or the fact that my husband is frequently congratulated for taking his own son out for a walk \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that has literally never happened to me. I feel lucky to have a partner who took five months of shared parental and annual leave, who feeds (we combi-fed, which set the tone from the start), changes, comforts, plays, cooks, shops, sorts the childcare payments, night-weaned the baby and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the worst task of all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c deals with the nappy bins. Yet I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel lucky, it should be normal. On the bright side, lots more men are what used to be called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153involved fathers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while also trying to hold down full-time work. Seeing how challenging that can be has made me reflect how, in our capitalist system, men can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it all either. For many, being able to work from home during the pandemic has been a gamechanger. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think women are inherently better caregivers than men,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Alex Marsh, a 39-year-old market researcher with two daughters, aged nine and 12. He tells me that he has always strived to do his share, remembering how the midwife \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wrote \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchands on dad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on her notes, as though that was remarkable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he and his wife said they shared the nappy changing. Alex was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153night duty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd parent, but was still working in London all week. Now that he only goes into the office twice a week, he is able to read his kids bedtime stories every night, cook most of their meals and handle their school admin: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I love it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Alex says he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel that exceptional among his peers, except maybe in terms of the cooking, but he worries that they are a minority. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are still a lot of relationships out there where the woman is expected to do more, simply because she is a woman.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A friend who works in tech, a similarly hands-on dad, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel rare either. He finds the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doesband\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd infantilising. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s messaging me back at 3.05am while trying to settle his toddler daughter and says the majority of fathers he knows are equal parents. In his industry, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considered commonplace: he got four months of paid paternity leave. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I still notice a huge generational legacy in behaviour,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. His grandparents and parents have been surprised by how dedicated he and his partner are to parenting equally. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no getting around that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draining and runs you into the ground ,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the early stages there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anger and frustration.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd My friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talk of the early stages makes me think that perhaps some couples succeed at equal parenting right off the bat, while others negotiate and learn as they go. Steph Douglas, 42, who runs the thoughtful gift company Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Buy Her Flowers and has three children, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjourney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that has involved me trying to understand why I was so resentful and unhappy after we had kids.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She found the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fair play\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd method \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a system that helps couples share household chores equally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c key in making their parenting genuinely more equal rather than simply giving her husband a list of tasks. As well as now sharing much of the parenting, her partner is in the school WhatsApp group \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they succeeded in signing up all the dads after she noticed it was only mothers. Some of us might move in circles where equal parenting is the norm, but the stats tell a different story. There is cause for hope, though. While hands-on dads have always existed, they are becoming more commonplace among younger generations of parents, and policy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in terms of paternity leave \u00e2\u20ac\u201c needs to catch up. Women seem less inclined to put up with an unfair division of labour and a heavy mental load, which is sexist and in many cases no longer makes financial sense. I enjoy the TV comedy Motherland, and have seen that, sadly, the useless, absent husband in it reflects the reality in some households. But millennial fathers I speak to repeatedly highlight how retrograde and depressing the wimpy stay-at-home dad character Kevin is. He simply does not resonate with younger parents, and though there is still a long way to go, that can only be a cause for hope. As for the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doesband\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it can get in the bin with the nappies. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working As well as equal parenting, I owe a lot to YSL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Touche Eclat concealer for making me look less haggard after all the sleepless nights. (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you look like a shoe?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd my friend said, suspiciously, when she met me for lunch shortly after I gave birth.)

None of my friends or family would have said I did, either. In 2013, when I was studying biomedical engineering, I stumbled across a Ted Talk by Joshua Foer, the author of Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything. He mentioned techniques such as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153memory palace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153journey method\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They tell you that if you want to remember things, imagine you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re journeying through a specific physical space, depositing images that represent the information you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to recall. I applied these techniques to my studies and day-to-day tasks. The first time I used a memory palace to recall a 20-item shopping list, I felt I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d encountered an earth-shattering superhuman ability \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something anyone can do. Initially, competitions were of no interest, but I tried a few activities that they involve, such as memorising the order of a deck of cards or lists of numbers. I started training in March 2013 and by September I had broken the one-minute mark for memorising and recalling a single deck of cards. The national record was slightly over a minute, so I realised I could compete with the best. In 2014, when I was 22, I entered the USA Memory Championship and came second. That spurred me on. Memorising cards has always been my favourite. I break the cards into pairs and assign an image to each pair. To the human brain, images are a lot more memorable than the abstract idea of, say, the six of diamonds. I use my childhood home as one of my memory palaces, and the first stop is outside the house, at the mailbox. If I was remembering a deck of cards, I could associate the first pair of cards with the image of Michael Jordan slamdunking a basketball into my mailbox. Then the next stop is the driveway. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll associate the second pair with an image of Ian McKellen as Gandalf leading the Fellowship of the Ring up the driveway. The images can be random \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always need to be related to the information you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to remember. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just about trying to make mental images that are as creative as possible to create a memorable story \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are inevitably ridiculous. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fun, which people might not expect, because memory seems like this dry thing. The fastest people in the world can memorise a deck of cards in 15 seconds or under. My personal best in a world championship event is 15.61 seconds. That said, the world championships are boring to watch. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like watching 300 people take a test, with desks all around the room. A lot of people, myself included, use earplugs. Some even have contraptions like horse blinkers to block out other people. American memorisers used to lag behind the rest of the world, but I was able to take the fight to the Europeans and became world champion for three years between 2015 and 2017. The first time I won, the prize money was about $30,000. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not professional sports money, but I was a medical student at the time, and that was a lot. Every world champion I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve met would agree that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a superhuman memory; they just learn their techniques. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never met anyone with a truly photographic memory. No one at a competition has been able to look at a page of numbers and recite it immediately. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m semi-retired from those competitions and instead compete in the Memory League. That involves fast events, like memorising a deck of cards as quickly as you can, or 50 words in under a minute. If the Memory World Championship is a marathon, the Memory League is like a sprint. I am this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world champion. In ordinary life, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if my memory has changed much. I do almost automatically put the techniques I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned from memory sports into practice, though. When I meet people, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard for me not to turn their name into an image. Katherine, for example, sounds a bit like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cat run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll remember a cat running around this person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never really thought of myself as a creative person, but the nice thing about memory sports is they have opened up that side of me. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 As told to Daniel Dylan Wray Do you have an experience to share?

It comes after the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) uncovered documents that appear to show that Abramovich secretly poured more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100m into Vitesse. While Chelsea and Vitesse were known to have a close relationship, with the London club frequently sending players on loan to its Dutch partner, the two teams had previously denied that the oligarch was involved in funding Vitesse. The latest investigation marks the third effort by the KNVB to probe the funding of Vitesse and any ties to Abramovich, after previous inquiries in 2010 and 2014-15. Those investigations found that Vitesse was bankrolled by a British Virgin Islands (BVI) company called Marindale Trading Ltd, which belonged to the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former owner Alexander Chigirinsky. However, they concluded that Abramovich had no managerial influence on the club. The KNVB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new inquiry comes after the Guardian and TBIJ revealed documents that appear to show that Marindale Trading was not the ultimate source of the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money. Instead, the company was part of a chain of loans originating from two companies in the British Virgin Islands, Ovington Worldwide and Wotton Overseas. Both BVI companies belonged to Cyprus-based trusts, of which Abramovich was the sole beneficiary. Between 2010 and 2016, at least \u00e2\u201a\u00ac117m appears to have flowed through this network of companies, which included entities in Liechtenstein, Belize, BVI and the Netherlands. The KNVB, which did not respond to a request for comment, has previously told the Guardian that it was not aware of these arrangements. They are now expected to be a key area of interest in the new investigation, which will be performed by a third party. Vitesse has previously said that it had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no knowledge of the way in which [Marindale Trading] was financed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The club has changed hands since then and is in the midst of a new takeover by US investment firm Common Group. Information about the funding of Marindale came to light in the Oligarch files, a cache of leaked data originating from the Cyprus-based offshore service provider MeritServus. In 2017, the Guardian reported that associates of Abramovich based at Chelsea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stamford Bridge offices had been involved in the Vitesse takeover. At the time, Chelsea declined to comment, saying only: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We enjoy a close working relationship with Vitesse Arnhem, as we do with other clubs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rules of Uefa, the European football confederation, require clubs that play against each other to be independently owned and run \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to ensure the integrity of the competitions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no individual or legal entity may have control or influence over more than one club participating in a Uefa club competition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A spokesperson for Vitesse said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have not yet received any formal information from KNVB about next steps, including a possible investigation. However, it is expected that KNVB wants this investigation to be conducted by an independent specialised company, that will probably also be appointed by KNVB.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chelsea declined to comment, and Abramovich and Chigirinsky did not respond to requests for comment."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/19/budapest-festival-orchestra-fischer-review-royal-festival-hall-london", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "Budapest Festival Orchestra/Fischer review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c heart-rending and remarkable Mahler", "lead": "The searing dissonances and lyricism of Mahler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ninth, the composer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poignant confrontation with mortality, are drawn out with remarkable clarity", "author": "Tim Ashley", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T08:53:56Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.035992", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/31d3bd0072123d0e72e1dd08ff8fc7ae0411eda8/0_196_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "Mahler has long been central to Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repertory and discography, so it comes as something of a surprise to realise how little of his work they have given us in concert in the UK over the years. Their London performance of the Ninth Symphony, part of their current European tour, helped redress the balance, as well as reminding us what superb Mahlerians they can be. The composer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last completed symphony, written after the diagnosis of the heart condition that later claimed his life, the Ninth is almost invariably described as one of classical music\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most far reaching confrontations with mortality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Terrifying and paralysing, as the strands of sound disintegrate,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was Leonard Bernstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous comment, though the pervading sense of dissolution is balanced by a deep, at times agonisingly poignant awareness of the beauties of the world soon to be left behind. Fischer established the parameters and ambiguities at the outset, as the fragmentary themes that underscore the opening movement gave way to the nostalgia of the first subject, then to the sudden lurch into the minor key that brings violence in its wake. The BFO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warm, dark sound and detailed, focused playing added to the gathering tensions as instrumental solos unwound over the relentless tread of the movement\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development, and searing dissonances clashed with moments of heart-rending lyricism. The L\u00c3\u00a4ndler-cum-scherzo sounded grotesquely menacing, with its jolting tempi and rigid rhythms, the pervasive sense of dislocation amplified by the caustic fugatos and bitter ironies of the Rondo-Burleske that followed, though the trumpet call at its centre, an intimation of the main theme of the last movement, brought with it a moment of extraordinary radiance. The final Adagio, however, was utterly remarkable, an organic unfolding of sound and emotion, played with incomparable richness of tone, and profound in its beauty right to the end as sound, and with it life itself, finally seems to ebb almost imperceptibly away.

Wrong, it seems: generation Z and millennials in the UK are significantly more likely to believe in hell than baby boomers, according to a new study by the Policy Institute at King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College London. Younger people are also more likely to believe in life after death than older generations, despite being less religious generally. The findings are part of the World Values Study, one of the largest academic social surveys in the world, which has been running for more than 40 years. According to its data, just under half (49%) of Britons said they believed in God, down from 75% in 1981. Only five countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Norway, South Korea, Japan, Sweden and China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are less likely to believe in God than the UK. The Philippines topped the league table, scoring 100%. Belief in heaven among the UK public has also fallen, from 57% in 1981 to 41% last year. But belief in hell and in life after death has remained largely consistent, at 26% and 46% respectively. When broken down by age, 32% of those under the age of about 40 said they believed in hell, compared with 18% of those aged between 59 and 77. Belief in life after death was 51-53% for younger generations, compared with 35-39% for older people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our cultural attachment to organised religion has continued to decline in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but our belief that there is something beyond this life is holding strong, including among the youngest generations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the youngest generations continue to have lower attachment to formal religion, many of them have similar or even greater need to believe that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmore than this\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Duffy said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cultural Christianity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had significantly declined among people born in the UK, although \u00e2\u20ac\u0153globally, religion is still a growth market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Britons are among the least religious of all countries in the survey, with the 24-country league table topped by Nigeria, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Greece and Poland. In the UK, one in three said they were a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153religious person\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, 46% said they were not religious, and 21% said they were atheist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 4% in 1981. David Voas, professor of social science at University College London, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Adults under 40 are much more likely than older people to call themselves atheists, but also to say that they believe in hell, which is a fascinating puzzle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK is among the most tolerant of the countries surveyed, with 82% of the public saying they trust people of a different religion. Only Sweden scored higher on tolerance. Twelve per cent of people in the UK agreed with the statement \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the only acceptable religion is my religion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, compared with 90% of Moroccans. Only people in South Korea and China said they prayed less often than Britons, almost two-thirds of whom said they prayed rarely or never. Another unexpected finding is that confidence in religious institutions had rebounded. Between 1981 and 2018, Britons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in churches and religious organisations fell from 49% to 31%, but by 2022 had risen again to 42%. A possible explanation is the provision by churches and other religious institutions of essential social services such as food banks, social hubs, warm spots and debt counselling as the cost of living crisis has escalated. Duffy said religious belief in the UK was unlikely to disappear, but would keep eroding. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It looks like a slow but inevitable decline, unless organised religions can engage with that broader sense of wanting something else beyond this life,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/19/documentary-alisa-kovalenko-charts-lives-five-ukrainian-teens-donbas", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Dreams shattered as war scatters Ukraine documentary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teenage stars", "lead": "Alisa Kovalenko had recorded the hopes and dreams of teenagers in the Donbas growing up with conflict rumbling in the background.

Three years later, as Kovalenko was finishing the edit of her film, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full-scale invasion of Ukraine changed everything. The lives of all her characters were abruptly altered and her three years of footage turned out to be a document of lives that would never be the same again, on territory now occupied by Russian forces. The resulting film, the recently released We Will Not Fade Away, is therefore a tender coming-of-age portrait and also a window into a lost world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This new, young generation was the biggest hope for Donbas. I always had this feeling that while many older people were brainwashed and still living in the Soviet past, these young people had a chance to build a new Donbas,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kovalenko, 35, in an interview in Warsaw this week, where the film is being shown in a documentary festival. The initial idea for the documentary was that it would follow five young people who lived in villages and small towns on Ukrainian-controlled territory, near the frontline with Russian proxy forces that had formed after 2014. The five had won a competition for Donbas teenagers to take a trip to Nepal to see the Himalayas. However, the more Kovalenko filmed in Donbas, the more the Himalaya competition and preparations for the trip faded into the background. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For me, the most interesting thing was that on this grey and depressing background, these young people were trying to follow their dreams and create their own realities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kovalenko. The film follows Liza, Lera, Andriy, Illia and Ruslan as they navigate the universal challenges of growing up in small towns \u00e2\u20ac\u201c overbearing parents and provincial boredom \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as the specifics of living close to a war zone. It draws a tender portrait of the five, who dream of escaping the grind of life in Donbas, where many of their families have always worked in coalmines or other industrial jobs. Ilia dreams of becoming an actor, though his grandmother scolds him, saying becoming a policeman is the only reliable job. Conflict is rarely a focus of the film but rumbles ominously in the background. All five are desperate to leave for bigger, more exciting places. Shooting the documentary took Kovalenko back to her own childhood in Zaporizhzhia, an industrial centre not far from Donbas, where she was born into a family of metalworkers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wanted to show that even in the most depressing places, you can also dream big,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. For all that the film casts a withering eye on the harsh landscape of Donbas, there is also a clear affection for the territory, as the teenagers find their own adventures to stave off boredom: holding glamour photoshoots in destroyed buildings, thieving lengths of copper from a minefield in an attempt to build a motorbike, or simply fantasising about what life might be like elsewhere. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine last February made We Will Not Fade Away a film with two codas. First comes the dreamlike voyage to the Himalayas, and then the gut-wrenching final scenes, which explain how the characters have been scattered, with two now living in western Europe, one in another Ukrainian city, and two remaining under Russian occupation. When the war began, Kovalenko was on a night train to Donbas, having just completed the first rough-cut of the film and planning to record some additional audio. After trying to persuade her characters to evacuate, she signed up to fight with a volunteer battalion, feeling that film-making was irrelevant when Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s independence was at risk. She spent five months on the frontlines around Kyiv and Kharkiv, before deciding to return to the film project late last summer. As the film tours documentary festivals around Europe, Kovalenko has begun thinking about her next project, for which she plans to use footage shot while she was fighting last year. It will focus not on the action of battle, but instead on the humdrum and tedium of much of the daily routine at the frontline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a side of life at war you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t often see. I did take part in offensive operations and then it did, briefly, look like Hollywood, but for most of the time, life at the frontline is boring waiting,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. She also wants to focus on the video recordings and written notes she made for her son, then four years old, in the event that she died in combat. Many of her fellow soldiers also had young children and it was a constant dilemma of how much to talk about life at the front, she said, and what to preserve for posterity. In late November, her former commander, Valeriy Krasnian, was killed and left behind young twins. She had wanted to go back to fighting, but before he was killed Krasnian had advised her to focus on film and on bringing the experience of life at the front to the screen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want the film to be about how you can communicate with a child about this sort of thing, about your feelings during wartime,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 We Will Not Fade Away is available to view on BBC iPlayer in the UK until Saturday 20 May"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/19/rishi-sunak-talks-up-ben-wallace-next-nato-secretary-general", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Rishi Sunak talks up Ben Wallace as next Nato secretary general", "lead": "PM praises \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwidely respected\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 defence secretary who has stated his interest in succeeding Jens Stoltenberg", "author": "Rowena Mason in Hiroshima", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T08:39:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036008", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/db74d3607a5de8a9fdcfdb73b345143e293f9054/0_136_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has talked up Ben Wallace in his effort to become the next Nato secretary general, after the defence secretary confirmed his interest in the job.

If Wallace were to get the job, it would trigger a byelection in his seat of Wyre and Preston North.

The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares have lost about a fifth of their value in the last year as investors have worried about the future of the Indian technology sector. The couple first entered the Sunday Times rich list last year when Sunak was chancellor in Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government, becoming the first frontline politician to be named in the annual ranking since its inception in 1989. When asked during the Tory leadership contest in August how he could relate to the public during a cost of living crisis, given that he was richer than the queen, Sunak said people should not hold his wealth against him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think in our country, we judge people not by their bank account, we judge them by their character and their actions.

The Big Apple may be the city that never sleeps but it is a city that certainly sinks, subsiding by approximately 1-2mm each year on average, with some areas of New York City plunging at double this rate, according to researchers. This sinking is exacerbating the impact of sea level rise which is accelerating at around twice the global average as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s glaciers melt away and seawater expands due to global heating. The water that flanks New York City has risen by about 9in, or 22cm, since 1950 and major flooding events from storms could be up to four times more frequent than now by the end of the century due to the combination of sea level rise and hurricanes strengthened by climate change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A deeply concentrated population of 8.4 million people faces varying degrees of hazard from inundation in New York City,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd researchers wrote in the new study, published in the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Future journal. The authors added that the risks faced by New York City will be shared by many other coastal cities around the world as the climate crisis deepens. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The combination of tectonic and anthropogenic subsidence, sea level rise, and increasing hurricane intensity imply an accelerating problem along coastal and riverfront areas,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they wrote. This trend is being magnified by the sheer bulk of New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s built infrastructure. The researchers calculated that the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s structures, which include the famous Empire State Building and Chrysler Building, weigh a total of 1.68tn lbs, which is roughly equivalent to the weight of 140 million elephants. This enormous heft is pushing down on a jumble of different materials found in New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ground. While many of the largest buildings are placed upon solid bedrock, such as schist, there is a mixture of other sands and clays that have been build over, adding to a sinking effect that is naturally occurring anyway along much of the US east coast as the land reacts to the retreat of huge glaciers following the end of the last ice age. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not something to panic about immediately but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this ongoing process that increases the risk of inundation from flooding,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tom Parsons, a geophysicist at the US Geological Survey, who led the new research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The softer the soil, the more compression there is from the buildings. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a mistake to build such large buildings in New York but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just got to keep in mind every time you build something there you push down the ground a little bit more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In 2012, New York was hit by Hurricane Sandy, which flooded parts of the subway and caused widespread damage, including power blackouts. Then, in 2021, Hurricane Ida flooded areas of the city, causing several people to drown. Scientists say both events were worsened by the effects of global heating. Parsons said that New York and other coastal cities \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have to get planning for this. If you get repeated exposure to seawater, you can corrode steel and destabilize buildings, which you clearly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want.

Survivors of child sexual abuse will be further supported as they seek help or make a compensation claim, under a $142.2 million funding boost over the next five years, reports AAP. Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth revealed on Friday an additional $142.2m in the May budget for the National Redress Scheme, to ensure survivors can access it in a timely and trauma-informed way. The funding will be used to improve the processing of applications, and outcomes for survivors accessing the scheme. Rishworth said the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priority was to make sure survivors did not face unnecessary delays, with improvements aimed at making it easier to apply. The extra money will ensure the scheme itself is adequately funded, but importantly that the support services around it are too, she told Sky News. The evidence shows that if people go through a redress support service then it is a smoother ride for them through the process. Of the funding, $80.1m over the next four years will be dedicated to scheme support services, including tailored services for Indigenous and disabled people, and language assistance. The minister cautioned that greater benefits of the program are still to come, as it takes time for people to understand they are entitled to redress. But an increasing number of institutions joining the scheme shows confidence in it is growing, she said.

The Energy Security Board (ESB), set up almost six years ago by the Turnbull government, will be scrapped, according to a communique from the meeting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recognising the strengthening of collaboration that has occurred between the Commonwealth and jurisdictions on critical energy market reforms under the National Energy Transformation Partnership, ministers agreed that the time is right to transition to a new operating model for the ESB to meet the challenges of the energy transformation in the national electricity market,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the statement said. In its place from 1 July will be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new model\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with an Energy Advisory Panel to coordinate market bodies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advice to governments. The panel will include the heads of the three energy market bodies and the energy commissioner of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as an observer. There had been gripes about the ESB for some time and about whether it had passed its use-by date. (Back in the day, the board was to have implemented then-PM Malcolm Turnbull\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national energy guarantee, but that ended up being blocked by his own party room, sealing his fate in the process.) The meeting discussed a range of other issues, including whether eastern Australia was entering the winter with enough gas in storage. The ACCC reassured ministers that there was sufficient supply to meet domestic needs. The Australian Energy Market Operator now needs to ensure ample supply gets to where it is needed in a timely fashion. PM addresses Stan Grant Q+A departure, calls for respectful debate on voice I just wanted to return for a moment to the PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presser in Hiroshima earlier, where he also addressed Stan Grant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to leave the ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q+A program. While Albanese did not appear to be across the exact details of the situation, he did say he respected Grant, and that, with the voice referendum on the horizon, online commentary remains respectful: I would just say Stan Grant is someone who has my respect, and I wish him well. I think we need to be really cognisant in the lead up to the referendum that will be held in the fourth quarter of this year about some of the hurtful comments that have been made. You only have to look at social media feeds to see some of the comments that, quite frankly, are completely out of line. We can have respect for different views without engaging in vilification, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important. Meanwhile, Sarah Ferguson, host of the ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7.30 program, has tweeted her support for Grant and her disgust at the abuse he has faced: Majid Kazemi execution by Iranian authorities prompts calls from Greens for sanctions Majid Kazemi, a man arrested after participating in a peaceful protest in Iran in November, has been executed by Iranian authorities. Kazemi had family in Australia who were campaigning on his behalf, and Australian Greens senator Jordon Steele-John was fulfilling the role of political sponsor, and working with his family. Steele-John announced this afternoon that Kazemi was executed, adding that the Australian government has not done enough in response to the Iranian regime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions: I am sharing this statement with a heavy heart, following the tragic news of the execution of Majid Kazemi by Iranian authorities. Majid was loved by many and had his whole future ahead of him. Living in Isfahan, he had a successful business making kitchenware from copper. In November 2022, Majid protested the Iranian authorities, who arrested him and forced him to confess under torture. He was sentenced to death despite no evidence presented to the court. Australia has always advocated against the death penalty, however, the Australian government has not done enough in response to the ongoing, unlawful and brutal executions. Alongside my Australian Greens colleagues, I am calling on the Australian federal government to expand the Magnitsky sanctions, including financial asset freezing and further visa bans on people linked to the Iranian regime, including key security officials, Basiji Militia, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp and the morality police. Additionally, we are calling on the Australian government to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation. The PM went on to address China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to lift restrictions on imports of Australian timber, saying Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relations with China need to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Albanese said it was important any impediments be lifted, and that China needs to show it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153believes in trade, according to international norms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: It is important [that] any of the impediments to trade between China and Australia be lifted. It is in Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest to be able to export our wonderful barley and wine and other products to China, but it is in China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest to receive there as well because they are the best in the world, the best seafood, the best agricultural products, and I reckon the best wine as well. But with China, our relationship is one which is on the improve, I think everyone can see that. We will continue to liaise with them on trade issues. It is important that China show that it supports trade, and any impediments don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t head in that direction to trade. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important, that China show the world that it does believe in trade, according to international norms, which are there. We have, on barley, we have suspended the action that we had taken there, and we hope that that provides for a win-win situation. That is what our objective is. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, speaking in Hiroshima this afternoon ahead of the G7 summit, has announced that Australia will be imposing further sanctions on Russia. Albanese announced additional sanctions to join those already implemented against more than 1,000 people and entities who support Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine. The latest sanctions target subsidiaries of Russian state-owned atomic energy corporation Rosatom that are involved in nuclear research, infrastructure development and weapons manufacturing. They will also target Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest petroleum company Rosneft, gold company Polyus PJSC and steel company Severstal PJSC. The sanctions will also bid to ban the export of machinery to regions of Ukraine currently under Russian control and to Russia itself. We will continue to work with the G7 and international partners to address the global impacts of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion. This includes the financial, energy, defence and metals sectors that aid and sustain Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war in Ukraine. China timber trade restrictions gone, barley could be next, Murray Watt says Agriculture minister, Murray Watt, was on the ABC earlier today, saying it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really positive step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to see China lift restrictions on imports of Australian timber. The restrictions were lifted earlier this week and Watt said there were also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positive signals on the barley front\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be hopeful that we can certainly get that resolved within that three-month window. I think this is another really positive step forward in our government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to try to stabilise our trading relationship with China. It is obviously something that everyone from the prime minister to Penny Wong and Don Farrell have been putting a lot of effort into since we were elected and really what this means is that we now resume the opportunity to export timber, products to China. Before the suspension was imposed by China about two and a half years ago, China was actually our largest export market for timber products. It was worth about $560 million to the timber industry at the time, and, of course that is a massive market to lose, and while we have been able to find other markets in the meantime, nothing has really been able to make up for the loss of that market to the timber industry. Watt went on to say that the entire situation reflected the need to diversify Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export markets to ensure industries aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hamstrung in this way again: One of the things that Australia producers and I think all Australians have learned through this experience is that we do need to keep up the efforts to diversify our markets to make sure we are never in this sort of situation again, whether it be China or any other country, but the reality is that even with these impediments that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had, China does remain our largest trading partner, including in agriculture, so it is an important market to resume connection with. Abuse of Grant was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcabhorrent and unacceptable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And just sticking with Stan Grant for a moment, ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of news, Justin Stevens, has addressed the situation, saying the abuse was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153abhorrent and unacceptable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a statement released this afternoon, Stevens says Grant was invited to take part in the coverage of the coronation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as a Wiradjuri man to discuss his own family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience and the role of the monarchy in Australia in the context of Indigenous history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He was not the instigator of the program. The panel discussion in which he participated aired early as one segment in around eight hours of live Coronation coverage. The timing of this important discussion in the lead-up to the event has resulted in a strong response from some viewers. This is regrettable. The responsibility for the coverage lies with ABC News management, not with Stan Grant. Yet it is he who has borne the brunt of a tirade of criticism, particularly in the usual sections of the media that target the ABC. Reporting on his contribution to the panel discussion has been unfair, inaccurate and irresponsible. It has contributed to fuelling horrendous personal and racial abuse. Any complaints, criticism \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or vitriol \u00e2\u20ac\u201c regarding the coverage should be directed to me, not to him. ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q+A host, Stan Grant, steps down after racist abuse following hosting of coronation Thanks Natasha, Mostafa Rachwani with you to take you through the rest of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news. And I just wanted to start with some breaking news: Stan Grant has announced he is stepping down as host of the ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Q+A program. In a column published on the ABC website, Grant says he is walking away because of the amount of racist abuse he has received in the wake of hosting the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coronation: Since the King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coronation, I have seen people in the media lie and distort my words. They have tried to depict me as hate filled. They have accused me of maligning Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth. My ancestors would not allow me to be filled with hate. Thanks for following along today. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m handing over to Mostafa Rachwani. Have a great weekend! A marine warning could bring dangerous rips, waves and strong rip currents to Lord Howe Island. NSW SES is advising people in the warning area as follows: Boats in harbours, estuaries or shallow coastal water should return to shore. Secure your boat and move away from the waterfront. Vessels already out to sea should stay offshore in water at least 25m deep until further advised. Obey all signs about beach and foreshore closures and instructions from emergency services. If you have a home or business emergency plan, refer to it now. Check to see if your neighbours are aware of this advice. NSW SES warns Lord Howe residents to take caution as tsunami may impact island NSW State Emergency Service (NSW SES) has issued an emergency warning for Lord Howe Island following an undersea 7.7 magnitude earthquake that triggered a tsunami. The SES says the island may be impacted by dangerous rips, waves and strong ocean currents in the marine environment, with the possibility of localised overflow onto the immediate foreshore. State duty commander, and assistant commissioner, Nicole Hogan, said people should avoid the immediate water\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge of harbours, coastal estuaries, rock platforms and beaches at Lord Howe Island. Boats in harbours, estuaries or shallow coastal water should return to shore and be secured. People should move away from the waterfront and obey all signs about beach and foreshore closures. At present there is no threat to mainland Australia, and the NSW SES is in constant communication with the Bureau of Meteorology and is monitoring the situation. Ticks and crosses for Albanese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to environment in Human Rights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report card Human Rights\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 report card is giving the Albanese government a middling assessment. It says that while the government legislated a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030, it is still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153actively supporting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the expansion of fossil fuels industries. The organisation specifically called out the environment minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first approval of a new coal mine this month as well as the fact that the government rejected a request to reconsider approvals for three other coal mine projects or extensions. This is contrary to earlier warnings by the United Nations, the International Energy Agency and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading climate scientists. You can read their full report card in their statement here. Human Rights Watch acknowledges human rights improvements but urges government to do better Leading up to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first anniversary in office, Human Rights Watch is calling on the government to do better when it comes to delivering on their human rights pledges. Sophie McNeill, the senior Australia researcher, said: While the Albanese government has made some improvements on human rights issues, serious concerns remain that need to be swiftly addressed. The Albanese government should take urgent, concrete steps to phase out fossil fuels, reduce the incarceration of First Nations people, and uphold Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international legal obligations toward people in detention, refugees and asylum seekers. A year in office and Anthony Albanese is betting big on Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better angels This Sunday marks a year since Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labor government won office. Our political editor, Katharine Murphy, reflects on the anniversary and how the mantle of the office has settled on the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader here: While a tsunami warning is in place for Lord Howe Island, the Bureau of Meteorology say there is no threat to mainland Australia. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCovid credit card\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 repayment plan in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state budget, Victorian premier says Paying back the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCovid credit card\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be a priority for the Victorian government in next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state budget, AAP reports. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, maintains all of Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election commitments will be delivered when the budget is handed down. But he says the government needs to address the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing debt, which is predicted to hit $166bn by mid-2026. The money borrowed during the Covid pandemic was not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153productive debt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that made the economy bigger, Andrews said. He told reporters: It was like a Covid credit card. We borrowed in an emergency to save lives, save jobs and get through a terrible, terrible event. He said the government had a plan to repay the debt but would not release details ahead of the budget. Anthony Albanese arrives in Japan for G7 summit The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has just touched down in Hiroshima ahead of attending the G7 summit. Australia is not part of the G7 but is one of several nations invited as an outreach partner. Some of the G7 leaders who are already in Japan laid wreaths at Hiroshima\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peace Memorial Park earlier this morning. AMP has been issued a $24m court-imposed penalty after it continued to charge the accounts of more than 2,000 deceased customers upon being notified of their deaths. The federal court issued the penalty after finding four AMP companies breached the law by charging life insurance premiums and advice fees to the superannuation accounts, which generated hundreds of thousands of dollars for the financial services firm. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic), which pursued the civil proceedings, said the misconduct represented a fundamental breach of trust between a customer and their financial services provider. Asic deputy chair, Sarah Court, said: The AMP companies had been notified that these customers had died, and despite this, continued to charge premiums and fees on their super accounts. The practice of some financial firms to charge dead customer accounts was one of the biggest revelations of the banking royal commission that recommended widespread changes to the sector in its 2019 report. AMP acknowledged the court decision in a statement on Friday and said that it had remediated all affected customer accounts. AMP group general counsel, David Cullen, said: We have made significant changes to our systems and processes in recent years designed to prevent this from recurring. Nicolas Cage heading to Australia in September to shoot new thriller The Surfer In news that will delight Nicolas Cage fans across the country, the actor is coming to Australia. Cage will be filming his new psychological thriller The Surfer in Australia from September this year, according to the Hollywood Reporter. In The Surfer, when a man (Cage) returns to his beachside hometown in Australia, many years since building a life for himself in the US, he is humiliated in front of his teenage son by a local gang of surfers who claim strict ownership over the secluded beach of his childhood. Wounded, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Surfer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decides to remain at the beach, declaring war against those in control of the bay. But as the conflict escalates, the stakes spin wildly out of control, taking \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe Surfer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to the edge of his sanity. BOM issues tsunami warning for Lord Howe Island The Bureau of Meteorology has issued a tsunami warning for Lord Howe Island after an undersea earthquake southeast of the Loyalty Islands. The 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred at around 12.57pm AEST, with the BOM saying that at this stage no tsunami waves have been recorded. They say that if a tsunami is generated, it will affect Lord Howe Island from after 4.15pm local time: The Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Centre is closely monitoring the situation and will advise immediately if there is cause for concern. NSW has recorded 14,699 new Covid cases in the seven days to Thursday, with 61 lives lost. There are 1,322 people in hospital with the virus, with 24 in ICU. This is a considerable uptick in cases from last week when NSW recorded just over 12,000 cases and 53 deaths. There were 9,316 new Covid cases in the weekly reporting period and 17 people are in intensive care. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another big jump from 7,594 cases last week and 6,452 in the first week of May. Deaths have come down since 44 were recorded last week. Liberals out in force at Chinese consulate event in Sydney China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consulate in Sydney hosted a welcoming for its new deputy consul general, Wang Chunsheng on Thursday evening, hours after China lifted its ban on timber imports from Australia and PM Anthony Albanese announced US President Joe Biden had cancelled his visit to the city. Wang and his boss, consul general Zhou Limin, addressed the audience in English, touting the opportunities the Middle Kingdom offers Australia, particularly if the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s middle class swells to 800m as projected over the next decade. Spotted among the dignitaries were federal manager of opposition business, Paul Fletcher, newly minted state Liberal MP Matt Cross, and recently retired NSW Liberal ministers, Geoff Lee (whose grandfather arrived from China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guangdong province in 1920) and Jonathan O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Dea. The latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor as speaker of the NSW lower house, independent MP Greg Piper, was also in attendance. Unaffordable housing will amplify teacher shortages, researcher says Eacott said housing affordability had been overlooked in the teacher shortage crisis because of other issues like increasing workloads, poor working conditions and stagnant pay. But he said the high price of housing was pushing teachers to choose between forgoing their salary for housing near their school or enduring long commutes. Housing affordability is one of those understated reasons why, and not doing anything to address it will only amplify the problem. Commutes of more than an hour would not be uncommon \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the school system is struggling to find enough teachers as it is. If teachers can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to live near or within reasonable commuting distance of their schools, we can only expect those shortfalls to continue to grow. Projections indicate NSW will need 13,000 more teachers in the next decade to meet student demand. Eacott says salary loading for teachers working in severely unaffordable areas would be one potential policy solution that could be implemented in the short term to help alleviate the cost of housing, as well as considering teachers and other essential workers in infrastructure planning when developing future cities. We rely so much on our teachers, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only fair we take steps towards providing them and other essential workers with affordable and secure housing options. Ninety per cent of teachers in New South Wales can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to live where they teach, new research has found. The UNSW Sydney study found housing affordability was a major issue hitting a sector already plagued by shortages and teachers were being priced out of housing near their schools, with many areas too expensive for educators at the top of the pay scale. Analysing quarterly sales and rental reports across the state, the study found there were 675 schools where the median rent for a one-bedroom place was unaffordable on a graduate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s salary. For experienced educators at the top of the pay scale, 70 schools were in an area where a single-bedroom home was also unaffordable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c equivalent to a person spending more than 30% of their income on housing. Study author Prof Scott Eacott said the last time a first-year teacher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s salary could comfortably afford the rent for a one-bedroom dwelling was around a decade ago. Fundamentally, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been an increasing gap between salary and the costs of housing that the standard pay rise isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t covering, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pushing teachers further away from their workplaces or out of the profession entirely. The issue is not just limited to teachers, but all essential workers who are increasingly finding it difficult to find affordable places to live within a reasonable distance of their workplace. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consulate general has officially opened in Kolkata. The assistant foreign affairs minister, Tim Watts, was part of the ceremony. No police officer is above the law, says NSW assistant commissioner That press conference about the incident in which 95-year-old Clare Nowland was Tasered by police has wrapped up now. Nowland has dementia and was living at an aged care facility. Cotter said out of procedural fairness to the officer involved, he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say whether he is facing criminal charges. What I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said is that no officer, not one of us, is above the law. All our actions will be scrutinised robustly from a criminal perspective as well as a departmental perspective of and if it dips into either of those domains you can be rest assured that if it lands there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m talking in a generic sense \u00e2\u20ac\u201c criminal actions will be taken. On whether she was engaging in a threat at the time she was Tasered, Cotter says: At the time she was Tasered she was approaching police, it is fair to say at a slow pace. She had a walking frame. But she had a knife. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it any further as to what was going through anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind with the use of a Taser. Ninety-five-year-old Clare Nowland was in treatment room alone when police arrived, says Cotter Cotter clarifies the incident did not take place in Clare Nowland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room: It was in a room. She had left her bedroom and had walked around the nursing home facility. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure exactly how long, but probably for a couple of hours she was out of her bed. She had gone to the kitchen, she had access to a knife, and she was in a treatment room, I think it is classified as, where medical treatment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a small confined space room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where treatment would normally be administered during working hours. And she was in that room by herself. Police and paramedics tried to de-escalate and get Nowland to drop knife: Cotter Asked about de-escalation tactics deployed before the Taser was used, Cotter says: The police and a number of staff, both paramedics and otherwise, engaged in conversation with her to de-escalate the matter for her to drop the knife and that went on in a conversation for a number of minutes. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to talk about the exact words used, but the words were clear to de-escalate the matter. Clare approach the doorway where the police were and at that stage the one officer discharged the Taser. However, Cotter says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in the public interest to release the footage while it forms a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant and integral\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the investigation. Body-worn camera footage of Tasering is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcconfronting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Cotter Cotter confirms there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confronting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd police body cam footage of the incident: I have seen the footage. Both officers had their body-worn video activated. The incident in its totality is captured, both audio and visual, and I have seen it and I understand what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It is confronting footage. Police officer involved will have duty type reviewed, says assistant commissioner What actions will be taken against the officer involved in the incident? Cotter: Clearly his duty type will be under review, understanding that this is a live investigation and has the opportunity to be spoken to and be interviewed. If at some stage we believe interim action has to be taken then it will be taken. At this stage, he is nonoperational, he is not in the workplace, and any ultimate sanction, if that is to be determined [as] an end result, that will be taken. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 have discussed it at every level,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 says Cotter of whether Nowland posed a threat to officers Asked about the public outrage over whether Nowland really could have threatened officers, Cotter says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been discussed at every level of the police force: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a matter for concern \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We have spoken about it at the upper echelons of this organisation, have discussed it at every level, and are very concerned about what occurred the other day that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we have the investigation live that we have at the moment. The police officer had 12 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience in the force, Cotter says: The officer involved specifically has about 12 years of experience. Cotter asked whether he thinks officers were at risk of being overpowered by 43kg, 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21222\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 95-year-old woman A reporter asks Cotter, given Clare Nowland is 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21222\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and weighs 43kg, whether he thinks that the officers were at risk of being overpowered. Cotter: Subjectively I cannot transport myself to the mind of the actual officer or officers. What I can say is that this is a very live and serious investigation of which the homicide squad is investigating and in the rights to everyone involved, the investigation process has to carry on. Tasers meant for self-defence, but assessment of threats \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery subjective\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says assistant police commissioner Peter Cotter, the NSW assistant police commissioner, is now taking questions. Asked about his reaction when he heard about the incident, Cotter speaks to the reasons why police officers carry weapons: The reasons why we carry weapons and equipment that we do is clearly to defend ourselves, principally the principles of self-defence. Defend yourself from harm or hurt or potential death. Equally, protect your colleague, your work colleague and to protect members of the public. Each of the pieces of equipment that we hold or carry a significance and I suppose are a trigger or condition that authorised the use. If I speak about tasers, per se, and not specifically about this incident, the rules governing that you can use your Taser as a police officer, and again it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very subjective to the threats facing you at that time, so we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk too much specifically about the incident, but generally, we say it is there is a piece of equipment to defend yourself when you think your life is in danger or someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life is in danger, where you have a genuine fear and threat of being physically overpowered, if there is a violent confrontation occurring but of course, those facts have to be real. Elderly woman Tasered by police going \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin and out of consciousness\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Cotter Cotter says Clare Nowland has been going in and out of consciousness: As we meet here today, the status or the health of Clare is that she still remains in hospital, she remains in and out of consciousness, her family with her, she is comfortable but I am not privy to talk any more about her absolute health diagnosis or prognosis. On behalf of the family who we have spoken to today, they literally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to say too much, they do want to say too much to me as a conveyor of any message and equally, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to say too much personally to the press. What they have asked of us is to express a behalf of them that if they could be left alone to attend to their mother, grandmother and the health of the family and the sadness they feel at this stage is their main concern. Speaking about what that investigation will involve, Cotter says: Numerous people will be spoken to: witnesses, \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 family, those present, police; statements will be taken and an investigation [which will be] ultimately reviewed by the professional standards command of the NSW police force with clear oversight from the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission of NSW. Cotter says the police critical incident investigation launched is the highest level investigation, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153level 1\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd classification: Following on from that specific incident, an investigation was commenced. As is the norm when part of a police operational response, and someone is injured, whether that be a member of the public or the police themselves, whether it be an offender or perhaps in this case Clare, an investigation is commenced, that is called a critical incident investigation. Given what was before us at midday on Wednesday, this investigation was nominated as a level 1 critical incident. The criteria for a level 1 critical incident classification is \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 an injury that leads to death or imminent death \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The policy states that in a level 1 critical incident, the homicide squad are involved. Significant concerns for 95-year-old Clare Nowland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health: Cotter Cotter says there are significant concerns for Nowland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health: She is a 95-year-old lady who suffers from some of the general frailties of that age, but the injury that she suffered as a result of hitting her head on the floor has rendered her bedridden at the moment. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not in a position to talk about her diagnosis or her prognosis, except to say that she remains in a critical condition and her family and extended family surround her and have done since about midday on Wednesday. There are significant concerns clearly for her health and where that may lead. Senior constable \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcactivated his Taser\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after Nowland did not drop knife, Cotter says Cotter says Clare Nowland did not drop the knife when police commenced negotiations: For whatever reason, she did not do that. One of the police officers who responded, a senior constable, activated his Taser which struck Clare, whereby she fell to the ground, striking her head. Immediate medical care and attention was delivered to Clare by the nursing staff and the paramedics and also the officers involved. As a result of that, the injury to her head, she was taken to the district hospital which is where she remains today. It is equally fair to say that she is in a state of ill-health. Police found 95-year-old Clare Nowland at nursing home holding a steak knife, Cotter says Cotter is now going into the details of what occurred on Wednesday when police were called to Clare Nowland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nursing home: On Wednesday morning, the 17th, police were called to the nursing home in Cooma. The call was along the lines of one of the patients, Clare, having a knife in her possession. Paramedics and police responded, and Clare was located within the nursing home facility. At the time she was in her room, she did have a knife in her hand and it is fair to say that she was armed with that knife. The knife in question was a steak knife, with a serrated edge, that she had obtained from the kitchen area of the nursing home a couple of hours earlier. Negotiations commenced with Clare to essentially drop the knife. Cotter: We have extended again our sympathy and our concern for what [the family] have gone through over the last couple of days and Clare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health. Assistant police commissioner says senior officers have been at bedside of 95-year-old woman Tasered on Wednesday The assistant police commissioner, Peter Cotter, speaks of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153care and the empathy and sympathy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd felt for the family of 95-year-old Clare Nowland: But of course her legacy is a number of children and grandchildren. We feel for all her family. We have been in contact on the ground there at Cooma with our officers, our senior police who have been with the family and been equally at the bedside of Clare since Wednesday. We have liaised with the family, talking to them candidly about what has occurred. As a senior member of the organisation and on behalf of the commission of police, I have also spoken with one of the daughters who is essentially the spokesperson in behalf of the family. NSW police have just stepped up to give a press conference about the 95-year-old woman Tasered by police in an aged care home. Marles: Australia-US alliance is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcis the centrepiece of our national security architecture, of our worldview\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Richard Marles is acting prime minister with Albanese attending the G7, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speaking in Ipswich in Queensland about the importance of the US and Australian leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 meeting at the summit: The president and the prime minister will be meeting at a time of huge consequence for our region, for the world, but also our relationship with the United States. Earlier this year we announce the optimal pathway for Australia acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine capability under the banner of Aukus. That will be really essential in terms of the talks we have with the United States. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The alliance between Australia and America really is the centrepiece of our national security architecture, of our worldview, and this is going to be a really important meeting between the two of them. Pilots hit out at Qantas over lease decision Pilots have hit out at Qantas over its plan to lease aircraft from Finnair, because the deal includes using the Finnish carrier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crew and pilots with the planes. Earlier today, Qantas announced it would lease two A330s from Finnair to fly between Sydney and Singapore and Sydney and Bangkok for two and a half years, as it patiently awaits delivery of its multibillion-dollar aircraft order to renew its ageing fleet in coming years. The Australian and International Pilots Association, a union representing Qantas pilots, has blasted the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appalling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd decision, with its president, captain Tony Lucas, calling Friday \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a sad day for our great airline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He was especially critical of the announcement alongside a plan for Qantas to convert two of its own A330 passenger planes into freighters. Lucas said: Qantas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to wet lease two Finnair aircraft is shocking, bitterly disappointing and could have been avoided with more effective management decisions \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The decision to wet lease illustrates the failures of the fleet planning processes of the last five years and certainly recent decisions made during the pandemic recovery. Not only is it disappointing for our hardworking and dedicated pilots but it is also disappointing for loyal Qantas passengers. Using the words of Qantas, stepping on to one of its aircraft is supposed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel like home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sadly this won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the case for passengers on these flights. Watchdog \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmonitoring\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 police investigation of Taser use The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission says it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153independently monitoring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the internal police investigation into the use of a Taser on a frail 95-year-old woman Clare Nowland in Cooma. In a short statement, the LECC said: The NSWPF are investigating the circumstances of the incident and the investigation will be reviewed by the Professional Standards Command. The LECC is independently monitoring the investigation under Part 8 of the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission Act 2016 to ensure public confidence in the investigation. Police are expected to front the media later this morning to explain why a Taser was used on Nowland in an aged care facility about 4am on Wednesday, which caused her to fall back, hit her head, and sustain life-threatening injuries. Police say the duty status of the officer responsible is under review. It has set up a critical incident response team, including homicide squad members, to investigate the use of force. Dutton: Noel Pearson \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwent overboard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in criticisms of Mick Gooda We brought you Noel Pearson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly scathing assessment of the former Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner Mick Gooda, who is pushing the yes campaign to compromise. In an interview with ABC Radio this morning, Pearson metaphorically accused Gooda of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wetting the bed far too early in the day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in suggesting the campaign remove executive government from the voice proposal. Dutton is saying he believes Pearson overstepped the mark with his comments: I would say [Gooda] is a person [with] a big heart, enormous heart, a very decent man, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he deserved the assessment that was given of him this morning. Noel is a wonderful Australian. He is a colourful character. By his own admission he has a pretty sharp tongue. I thought this morning he went overboard in relation to Mick. Mick is a good person, a good man; he wants what is best for Australians. There are many Indigenous Australians who are supporting the voice and many who are opposed to it. We should have a respectful debate. That is what I would ask of Noel Pearson [and] of everyone in the debate. Dutton says Australians are starting to work out Albanese sees \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political advantage out of the voice being a wedge against the Coalition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Counterproductive for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcelites within sport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to take position on voice to parliament: Dutton Dutton says he believes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counterproductive for sporting codes to be advocating a position on the voice: Look, I actually think we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to have an honest conversation here. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counterproductive for the sporting codes to be out there advocating a position because most of their fans are really scratching their head as to why the elites within sport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly the elites involved in the administration of the game, taking a position in relation to the voice, when those who are watching a football match are happy to hear the arguments for and against and have the detail and understand what it is that they are being asked to vote for at the referendum later this year. They will make their own minds up. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be told by the CEO of the organisation, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be told by some multimillionaire living in a capital city in a mansion how they should be voting when they are struggling out in the suburbs. Bipartisan support on gambling ad ban in the interest of the nation, says Dutton Speaking of Dutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s push to ban gambling advertising, the opposition leader has been speaking about the matter this morning at a Salvation Army outpost in Brisbane: We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow a culture to continue where young people are introduced at a younger and younger age to betting and gambling culture because, for many Australians, it becomes unmanageable. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we made the announcement last week. And here at the Salvation Army, you see the frontline service and those volunteers and employees in the Salvation Army who are working with people with addiction, who have a gambling addiction, who have lost a fortune, who have lost their family or their house. Dutton says while he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard a response from the prime minister on the issue, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the interest of the entire nation for his proposal to receive bipartisan support. The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, says she hopes sporting codes will also back the opposition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call to ban gambling ads during sporting broadcasts if they are following the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moral compulsion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to back the Indigenous voice to parliament. Ley was asked about the no campaign being outnumbered when it comes to peak sporting bodies after the news yesterday that the AFL commission will support the yes campaign, joining Football Australia, Tennis Australia, the Australian Olympic committee, and Commonwealth Games Australia. She responded: The sporting bodies can take whatever position they choose. I would say to them, if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at moral compulsion they all might also look at the changes Peter Dutton announced to gambling advertising and big codes with a conscience, and I hope they back that in too. Queensland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new housing minister visits public housing construction site Less than 24 hours after she was sworn in, Queensland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new housing minister, Meaghan Scanlon, donned hi-vis and a hard hat at a construction site in the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s south-east. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, deputy premier, Steven Miles, and Scanlon fronted the cameras on Friday following a cabinet reshuffle that took many by surprise. The trio reannounced the construction of 281 homes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including 75 social and affordable housing units \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at a retirement community, Parkside Yeronga. Scanlon, a 30-year-old renter, said she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153up for the challenge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as housing minister. She confirmed she had already met with Micah Projects to discuss emergency and crisis accommodation. I know from a public housing perspective, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really hard to find safe places. The real estate and housing sector is complex, and we need to get the balance right. We need to unlock supply. But Palaszczuk batted off questions about further changes such as limiting the amount rent can be increased by. She said the government had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153already made a very serious decision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about limiting the frequency of rent increases to once a year. A little bit more information on the WorkCover changes to mental health claims related to anxiety, overwork and stress, via the premier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media release: WorkSafe will update the test for workers receiving WorkCover weekly payments beyond two-and-a-half years by introducing a Whole Person Impairment test of greater than 20 per cent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to more objectively measure the degree of physical and mental impairment. Additionally, workers who experience stress and burnout will no longer be able to access weekly benefits from WorkCover \u00e2\u20ac\u201c instead, they will be eligible for provisional payments for 13 weeks to cover medical treatment, while enhanced psychosocial supports will be provided to help them return to work or explore training pathways. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe can do way better\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with upfront care to return Victorians to work, doctor says Occupational physician, Dr Mary Wyatt, is now speaking. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supportive of the changes, saying the longer people are on WorkCover, the worse they are for it: For over 20 years we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been advocating for better systems to help people back to work. We see the negative impacts [on] people day in and day out, when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re subjected to schemes that are not set up and are working in their best interests. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 If you care right upfront and look after people in those first few weeks, we can do way better. And even better than that is prevention, and particularly prevention of psychosocial hazards or mental health issues at work. So we are so pleased to hear about Return to Work Victoria and a coordinated effort to actually tackle those problems in the early months. Pearson on WorkCover changes: This is a sensible balance and a sensible pathway forward. And I think we really have done the hard work to get it right. As the premier has indicated, we need to make sure that we get the legislation right going forward. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to require more time and more work with unions in business because this is complicated legislation. But we are absolutely up for the challenge that lies before us because we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to get this wrong. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone wants to see a situation where we do not have a functional, solvent, sustainable workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 compensation scheme in the state of Victoria. WorkCover changes to repair \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfundamentally broken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scheme, minister says The minister for WorkSafe, Danny Pearson, is now speaking about the importance of the changes to WorkCover: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been honest and upfront, the scheme is fundamentally broken and it needs to be repaired. Back in 1986 when the scheme first started, 2% of claims were mental health claims; at the moment they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re 16% and they represent 50% of the scheme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We just cannot sit idly by and let this happen and I will not let the scheme fail. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve come up with a package of reforms and as the premier has alluded to, not everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happy. The board suggested that we should have a premium increase at over 2%. We thought that was too excessive. We could have had a whole person impairment test at 130 weeks, it could have been 35% like in South Australia or 29%. Again, we thought that was too excessive. Andrews also says people currently on WorkCover will not be affected: If you are a beneficiary of this scheme, this does not affect you; you are grandfathered, in essence. This is for prospective clients, for those who have not yet reached the 135-week mark. There will be a legislative review of all of the changes in three years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time from the time they pass parliament. Victoria to introduce \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhole person impairment test\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for lifetime work compensation The Victorian government is also limiting eligibility for claims relating to anxiety, overwork and stress. Andrews says: The number of mental health claims, as they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re sometimes called, particularly for issues of stress and burnout, has grown incredibly. Now, we need to provide people that make those claims with support. We need to make sure that we wrap support around them, but not have them in a situation where they are away from work and unable to work for years and years and years. That is not a good outcome. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 In order to get those lifetime benefits more broadly, you will need to pass a new test, a 20% whole person impairment test, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considerably lower than other parts of our country where a similar test operates \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] 35% in South Australia, for instance. As part of the changes, there will be further obligations on employers to provide \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mental and emotional, psychological safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Andrews says. More on Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WorkCover changes Andrews says premiums will increase from 1.27% of businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 payroll to 1.8%. The government is also making legislative changes to the scheme, including setting up a new agency called Return to Work Victoria. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how he explains its function: That will be to [provide services to] people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a catastrophic injury but \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not well managed, if not properly supported, if not given the care and attention and support that they need \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can find themselves on benefits, locked out of the labor market [and] not well enough, not confident enough, to be able to come back to work. That agency will be all about bespoke case management, and also working with employers, to make sure that they provide the safest environment, and an environment where, if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an issue, that issue can be dealt with. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI always want to encourage more women into politics,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 says Ley on Fadden byelection The deputy Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, is stopping short of saying she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to see a woman preselected for the Fadden byelection following Stuart Robert officially tendering his resignation yesterday. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast, Ley said the gender of the Liberal candidate was a decision for the state division: I want to see more women in parliament and I have never stepped away from that. Obviously the selection of the candidate who will be fighting for Fadden \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. it is up to the Queensland division who they select. Yes, I always want to encourage more women into politics whether that be directly into representing the party as a candidate or as an organisation more broadly stepping up in the local government. Daniel Andrews announces changes to WorkCover The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is announcing sweeping changes to the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WorkCover scheme, which he says is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broken\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: The number of claims and the cost of claims has tripled since 2010. And what we know is that if people are consigned to hundreds and hundreds of weeks of benefits, being away from friends, co-workers, connection, productive work, then that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s simply no good for them and their family. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no good for them financially as well. Of course, all those health impacts \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 come from a system that should be about getting you back to work. The position of a police officer who used a Taser on a 95-year-old woman in a Cooma aged care facility, leaving her in a critical condition, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153under review\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, police say. Police will front the media at 11.30am to explain why its officers deployed a Taser on elderly woman Clare Nowland, who suffers from dementia. In a statement, police confirmed the officer responsible is having his duty status under review. It also confirmed the homicide squad has been brought in to help investigate the incident. In a statement, police said: About 4.15am on Wednesday (17 May 2023), emergency services were called to an aged care facility on Binalong Crescent, Cooma, after reports a resident was armed with a knife. Officers attached to Monaro Police District attended, along with NSW Ambulance paramedics, and located the woman, still armed with a knife. Police attempted to speak to the woman. During this interaction, a senior constable discharged his taser, causing the woman to fall and strike her head. The 95-year-old woman was treated by NSW Ambulance paramedics before she was taken to Cooma District Hospital, where she remains in a critical condition. A critical incident team comprised of officers from State Crime Command\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Homicide Squad are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident, including the discharge of a taser. That investigation is subject to independent review. The officer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duty status is under review. NSW Council for Civil Liberties calls for independent probe of police\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tasering of 95-year-old woman The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties has called for an independent, external investigation of police\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of a Taser on a frail 95-year-old woman in a Cooma aged care facility on Wednesday. Police used the Taser on Clare Nowland, 95, at Yallambee Lodge, leaving her in a critical condition. The council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Josh Pallas, said the investigation should not be conducted internally by police. Police should never investigate police. The NSW Ombudsman and the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission should initiate an inquiry into this because it transcends issues of police powers with mental health and ageing. We have heard nothing from the NSW minister for ageing, Jodie Harrison or the minister for mental health, Rose Jackson. I would have expected given the significance of this matter both ministers would be on the front foot and proactive to ensure that this never happens again. We need to ensure that no matter what the circumstances of this case that our elderly nursing home residents are protected. That includes protection from excessive police force. Qantas announces new international services as company continues post-pandemic recovery Qantas is continuing to ramp up its international operations, leasing additional planes from other airlines as it waits for newly bought planes to arrive to replace its ageing fleet. While Qantas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 domestic operations recovered faster, its international capacity is still at just 84% of its pre-pandemic levels. Aiming to reach 100% of pre-Covid levels by March 2024, Qantas on Friday announced a slew of new international services, including increasing flights to Tokyo, Los Angeles and New York from October. Qantas also announced it would lease two Airbus A330s from Finnair to boost its fleet, as it patiently waits to re-energise what has become one of the oldest fleets among its competitors. Qantas continues to reactivate planes including its A380s that have been stored in the desert since the pandemic. Elsewhere, Sydney airport has announced its passenger traffic reached 83.9% of pre-pandemic levels in April. The airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Geoff Culbert, said Chinese passport holders now ranked third in the list of top 10 nationalities to fly through Sydney in April. While this market is still at 53.8% of pre-pandemic levels, Culbert said the momentum since China reopened its borders has been pronounced. Culbert said: At the end of this month, Sydney airport will have seven mainland Chinese passenger carriers offering 30 return services per week, with even more flights to be added soon. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkable considering we started the year with just three airlines flying four return services to mainland China a week. UK and US participation in Aukus a sign of their serious concerns for Pacific, Dutton says Dutton says he agrees with Marles on the importance of prioritising the navy. He goes on to say the US and UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s participation in Aukus is proof they hold serious concerns in the region: But we have to be realistic about the militarisation within the region; under the Aukus deal that the Labor party signed up to, there will be four nuclear powered submarines from the US and one from the UK essentially based in our waters from 2027. So that tells you a lot about what the Americans see, what Nato sees. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start moving their assets, significant assets like submarines and relocating them from other theatres or other seas and locations into our part of the world unless they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very concerned about what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very concerned about what the next few years might hold. Defence minister says improving Australian navy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firepower is front of mind The former defence force chief Sir Angus Houston yesterday told the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies that Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Navy lacked the necessary weaponry and firepower to combat China. Circling back to Marles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Today show interview, the defence minister said the navy was front of mind as evidenced by the Aukus deal to acquire nuclear-powered subs: It is very important that we bring a lot more potency to our defence force in general, but [Houston] was talking specifically about our navy and that is very much in the forefront of our minds in terms of how we respond to the defence strategic review. Which is why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at our surface fleet right now but also why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re moving down the path of acquiring a nuclear-powered submarine capability. It is really important that we are doing everything we can to meet this challenge because we do face a very complex time. Social services minister announces $142.2m funding boost to survivors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 compensation scheme Survivors of child sexual abuse will be further supported as they seek help or make a compensation claim, AAP reports. The social services minister Amanda Rishworth has today revealed an additional $142.2m funding boost to the national redress scheme over the next five years, to ensure survivors can access it in a timely and trauma-informed way. Rishworth said the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priority was to make sure survivors did not face unnecessary delays. This extra funding will allow more survivors access to free, confidential, practical, and emotional support for those applying or considering applying to the scheme. Of the funding, $80.1m over the next four years will be dedicated to scheme support services, including tailored services for Indigenous and disabled people and language assistance. Yunupingu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vision \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcelevated us all\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says PM in tweets paying tribute to Indigenous leader Before he jetted off to Japan, the PM attended the public memorial for Gumatji leader Yunupingu in northeast Arnhem Land community where he was born. Albanese said Yunupingu, who died on 3 April, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153elevated us all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: You can read more about the memorial from our Indigenous affairs editor Lorena Allam: Dutton continues opposition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticisms of Labor budget Dutton also continues the opposition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main line of attack on the Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government budget, claiming it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inflationary. Economists says otherwise but the opposition leader paints a bleak picture of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middle Australia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd struggling: I think in the budget for middle Australia, we have that whole class of people now [where] Labor is creating the essential working poor, working their guts out, barely keeping their heads above water. Asked if there was any happiness to be found, Dutton says: Lots of happiness. In two years time I hope we can vote a bad government out and Richard can find a full time job at the show there. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that like-minded countries come together,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Dutton says Opposition leader Peter Dutton is appearing opposite Richard Marles, and says meetings like the Quad and the G7 are crucial: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important that like-minded countries come together to express our commitment to freedom of speech, to freedom of navigation, to all of the values that have stood us well over a long time. And I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an important optic for the world as well to see all of the leaders there. Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cancellation not a snub, Marles insists The media is still trying to get the Albanese government to admit it feels bruised after Joe Biden cancelled his Australian visit for the Quad leaders meeting. But deputy prime minister Richard Marles tells the Today show he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t describe what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened in terms of a snub: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a leader of a country who is dealing with an urgent issue in terms of their domestic politics. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfortunate. But it happens. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing more than that. Marles emphasises that Anthony Albanese and the other Quad leaders will still be meeting on the sidelines of the G7, which he is pretty chuffed Australia has been invited to: It says a lot about Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing in the world right now. It says a lot, I think particularly about our relationship with Japan, actually, given that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the hosts of this. An Australian doctor has been reunited with his family after more than seven years in captivity in west Africa. Dr Kenneth Elliott and his wife Jocelyn Elliott were kidnapped by extremists in northern Burkina Faso near the border with Mali in 2016. Jocelyn Elliott was released a month later in February 2016. Over seven years later, the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, says Elliott has been released \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe and well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after tireless work by the government and Elliott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family. Wong acknowledged the strength and resilience of Elliott and members of his family \u00e2\u20ac\u0153through the most difficult of circumstances\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The family said: We wish to express our thanks to God and all who have continued to pray for us. We express our relief that Dr Elliott is free and thank the Australian Government and all who have been involved over time to secure his release. We also continue to pray for those still held and wish them freedom and safe return to their loved ones. At 88 years of age, and after many years away from home, Dr Elliott now needs time and privacy to rest and rebuild strength. We thank you for your understanding and sympathy. Busy summit will boost Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade, Alabanese says Anthony Albanese says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honoured to accept Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invitation to take part as an outreach partner at the G7 summit in Hiroshima. Albanese says the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153busy summit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will help boost Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international trade: This is a vital meeting at a vital moment for the global economy and our region, and it builds on the ambitious agenda for Australia we outlined in last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s budget \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m proud to take Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seat at a table that represents more than half a trillion dollars a year in trade \u00e2\u20ac\u201c supporting Australian businesses, producers, jobs, innovators and industries \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 A strong economy at home depends on strong relationships and engagement abroad. One in four Australian jobs are related to international trade and we know jobs in export industries pay above the national average income. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why my government continues to work hard to restore Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation in the region, to engage constructively in multilateral forums, and to rebuild our national credibility on the entry ticket for modern international dialogue: a commitment to act on climate change. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to resume importing Australian timber hailed The agriculture minister, Murray Watt, says China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement it will resume importing Australian timber is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very positive step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast this morning, Watt says while he understands lingering concerns within Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s timber industry despite the ban being lifted: It is an important market to resume connection with. Watt also says China has given \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positive signals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which should see the tariffs on barley lifted within three months: As I understand it from Don [Farrell], having spoken to him last night, there were positive signals on the barley front. We would be hopeful that we could get that resolved within that three-month window. The next thing would be wine. NSW police commissioner Karen Webb says she understands community concerns in response to yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news that police used a stun gun on a 95-year-old woman with dementia at an aged care facility. Webb has released a statement: My thoughts are with the family at this difficult time. I understand and share the community concerns and assure you that we are treating this matter with the utmost seriousness. A Critical Incident Investigation is currently being conducted into the circumstances of the incident. Noel Pearson continues to be very critical of Mick Gooda for offering his view \u00e2\u20ac\u0153executive government\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should be removed from the voice proposal: Mick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem is that he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t separate compromise from capitulation. He thinks capitulation is compromise \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Mick Gooda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intervention, all it does is of course is make the yes campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s job harder. Pearson warned about the danger of giving \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the whole game away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the voice if campaigners gave in on removing executive government. When Noel met Julian Noel Pearson is recounting a meeting with Julian Leeser two weeks ago. (Leeser resigned as shadow attorney general after the Liberals decided to oppose the voice but still wants to see executive government taken out of the proposal.) Pearson claims that during the meeting Leeser admitted that his proposed change to the voice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which Mick Gooda is also backing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring anyone new onboard from the opposition: Two weeks ago I spent a whole day with Julian Leeser, my old friend \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and he made the case for revisiting this issue. And I asked him, what happens if this is done, who in your party is going to come onboard if an amendment like this is made? And I told him that your amendment would actually gut the voice proposal, because it would remove \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the most important function a voice would perform. And he told me in all honesty that \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 no new people would come onboard [in the Coalition] if the change was made, but it may help with the overall vote. Pearson says yes campaign proper is yet to begin Former Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice commissioner Mick Gooda yesterday said the yes campaign leadership needed to compromise because the referendum was too important to fail and he fears that is. Cape York Indigenous leader and co-architect of the Uluru statement Noel Pearson is this morning telling ABC Radio that Gooda is wrong. Pearson acknowledges the situation is challenging but says the campaign proper is yet to begin: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been under heavy weather. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been out in the ocean and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re approaching the river. And when you get to the river, the bar is rough. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been going through that process \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The campaign proper is yet to start. When this legislation passes, the parliament will be ready to start a long paddle up the river. Chalmers trumpets Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic achievements The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has released a statement trumpeting the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic achievements on the (almost) one-year anniversary of the 2022 election. They are: More than 330,000 jobs created since May 2022 Wages growth of 3.7% in the year to the March quarter A forecast surplus in 2022-23, a dramatic turnaround from the $78 billion deficit we inherited from the previous government. A forecast Budget improvement of more than $143 billion over four years to 2025-26, compared to the Coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2022-23 March Budget. Legislated an emissions reduction targets of 43 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2050, and passed the safeguard mechanism Investing over $40 billion in our plan to make Australia a renewable energy superpower Cost of living relief on childcare, medicines, the jobseeker base rate increase, rent assistance, energy rebates and single parent payments Chalmers said: Australians have every right to be proud of what we have achieved together over the past year. Unemployment remains near a 50-year low, wages have started moving again, and our economy is forecast to grow faster than any of the G7 major economies this year. We have begun the hard yards of getting the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances back on track, cutting debt and deficits as well as our interest bills. At the same time, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re delivering meaningful cost-of-living relief, investing in health, aged care and better government services, and laying the foundations for a stronger, more secure and resilient economy. While many challenges remain, what we have managed to accomplish in these past 12 months only makes me more optimistic and ambitious for our economy, our country and our people. The Albanese government will continue its work to improve the strength and sustainability of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances and build a stronger and fairer economy that delivers more opportunities for more Australians. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is on his way to Hiroshima for the G7 summit where Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of the Ukraine and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic coercion are expected to be on the agenda. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hang on a second, Australia is not part of the G7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you are correct. Albanese is going as one of a number of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outreach partners\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd expanding the Eurocentric group. Albanese will for the first time meet with Brazil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, as well as South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, after a visit to Hiroshima\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peace Park and the Atomic Dome with the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mayor today. There will also be a last-minute scramble to assemble the Quad leaders to meet on the sidelines after US President Jo Biden called off his visit to Sydney, triggering the event\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cancellation. Back home, the government has been told to draft laws to ban Nazi symbols after concerns were identified about the opposition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislation. The Labor-chaired committee questioned how shadow attorney general Michaelia Cash\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draft bill would be enforced, whether it would stand up to a constitutional challenge and unintended consequences, included making martyrs out of Nazis. In NSW the state government is moving to honour its election promises on gambling with related signage to be removed from outside pubs and clubs. Staying in the state, you may have read this horrifying story yesterday that police allegedly used a stun gun on a 95-year-old woman with dementia, leaving her with a fractured skull. NSW police commissioner Karen Webb says she understands community concerns.

They made the whole thing up! The royal family was trying to Diana them! They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re incorrigible attention-seekers who exaggerated to try and get British taxpayers to pay for their security costs! Public reaction to news that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the duchess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother had been in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153near catastrophic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd car chase with paparazzi in New York on Tuesday evening has been divided, to say the least. Some people seem to think that the severity of the incident has been inflated in an effort to drum up sympathetic PR for the Sussexes, at a time when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re mired in several lawsuits about their privacy and security. Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly, for example, accused the pair of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exaggerating, because they like being in the public eye\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Others, citing the obvious echoes of the paparazzi chase that killed Princess Diana in 1997, are horrified at how close the Sussexes came to death. Look on social media and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also find wild conspiracy theories that a crafty King Charles engineered the whole thing and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so much an accident as an assassination attempt. The passionate and polarized response to Tuesday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incident is hardly surprising. Harry and Meghan have devoted fans and equally devoted haters; they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so much as eat a cheese sandwich without inspiring a string of unhinged reactions. Nevertheless, the range of responses to this particular event is remarkable: even the people directly involved seem to have very different recollections of what happened. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start with how the Sussexes characterized the chase. On Wednesday a spokesperson for Prince Harry said that the three passengers had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi. This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Chris Sanchez, a member of Prince Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security team has corroborated this description of events. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The public were in jeopardy at several points,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sanchez told CNN. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It could have been fatal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The New York Police Department, meanwhile, characterized the incident as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than catastrophic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries or arrests in regard,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an NYPD spokesperson said. New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mayor, Eric Adams, while condemning the paparazzi as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reckless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irresponsible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, similarly characterized the incident as less dramatic than the Sussexes described and cast doubt on the supposed time-frame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would find it hard to believe that there was a two-hour high speed chase,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Adams said. A fair point since a two-hour high-speed chase in Manhattan is near impossible unless it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 4am on a Sunday or Vin Diesel is behind the wheel. However, as Adams noted, even a 10-minute pursuit would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely dangerous in New York City\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Whatever happened, the real hero of the hour is Sukhcharn Singh, the yellow cab driver who was chauffeuring the threesome. Singh seems remarkably relaxed about his role in shuttling the Sussexes to safety. (Bear in mind that it probably takes a lot to faze a New York cab driver.) Singh told CNN that he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel under threat by the encounter with photographers but Harry and Meghan looked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nervous and scared\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also told the Washington Post that the incident lasted 10 minutes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I would call it a chase,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Singh said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never felt like I was in danger. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like a car chase in a movie.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Still, added Singh, he could understand why his famous passengers were terrified. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You know, my feelings were normal, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure their feelings were more intense because of what his mom, Princess Diana, died in a crash running away from the paparazzi,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So I think their emotions must have been higher.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really the crux of it, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? We all react to high-pressure situations in different ways, based on our personal histories. It is perfectly natural that Prince Harry would be traumatized by being aggressively pursued by the paparazzi. Nobody has any right to dismiss or diminish his response to what must have been a very triggering situation. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to particularly like Harry and Meghan to be disturbed by the constant vitriol directed against them, particularly from the British media. And you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be a Harry and Meghan cheerleader to feel disturbed at how they were treated by the royal family. Who, by the way, have kept conspicuously quiet on the car chase. Anyway, if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a happy ending to come out of all of this I hope it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that Singh gets a cameo in the next Fast and the Furious movie.

In the startling flute sound of the Paris-raised, Franco-Syrian improviser and composer Na\u00c3\u00afssam Jalal, its oldest virtues and wildest modern manifestations become one. The flute came into its own as a solo jazz instrument through such pioneers as Yusef Lateef, Herbie Mann and Rahsaan Roland Kirk in the 1950s and 60s, broadminded improvising virtuosi who drew on ancient and modern techniques from cultures all over the globe. Jalal is a comparable 21st-century visionary, a remarkable artist who draws on Arabic, African, classical and jazz techniques, hip-hop and more. She was hospitalised when she imagined the cinematic Healing Rituals, an album later realised with subtly skilful partners Cl\u00c3\u00a9ment Petit on cello, Claude Tchamitchian on bass, and Zaza Desiderio on drums. Here, Jalal salutes the inspirations from the natural world that helped her back to health. Rituel du Vent is a standout, with a hooting, twisting melody with Petit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cello swerving around it, building to a thrilling flute improvisation segueing pure tones and wild, exhortatory sounds. Rituel de la Rivi\u00c3\u00a8re\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tranquil theme is shared by Jalal and Petit with a water-on-rocks hand-drum murmur, Rituel de la For\u00c3\u00aat builds from eerie vocal and birdlike sounds to a thundering percussion climax, Rituel de la Lune from a percussive bass intro to a dizzying Jalal improv crescendo of headlong flute runs and semi-vocalised whoops.

Tom Rachman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Imposters doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let them off too lightly either. His first novel, The Imperfectionists, focused on journalists. Here he offers a convoluted study of a different sort of writer, the ageing novelist Dora, in a treatment that is not unfeeling, though needlessly contorted. The book, one gradually realises, is supposed to have been written by Dora \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Rachman is playing the ventriloquist here, with Dora his dummy. What we get are disparate pieces of fiction that Dora is presumably working on (mostly in the present tense, alas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c almost always a mistake). These stories within stories, combined with scored-out sentences, snatches of her diary and Dora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own cameo appearances, coalesce into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153punishing self-portrait\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Dora claims to be retired, but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop writing. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a cement mixer, continually churning away, propelling aspects of her past into new formations on the page. She also toys with the idea that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a manuscript could be about writing itself\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Please, no. But that is what this novel becomes, through various stabs at narrative. Individually, they are absorbing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mystifying fluidity and self-regard to it all, with one unrelated thread leaching into another for no discernible reason. You can lead your readers to truncated plots, but can you make them care? Writing about writing about writing is a tricky exercise, and a pretty thankless one. It is perhaps particularly brave to write a novel about a weary novelist, and this is not made more palatable by the flat tone, belittling characterisations (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153sideburned Glaswegian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153middle-aged Persian woman\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plump pharmaceuticals rep\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), and sloppiness (people fall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153under a boulder of illness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; bookcases \u00e2\u20ac\u0153run down the wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The only question is, should this stylistic carelessness be attributed to Rachman, or to his scribbling protagonist? For a pensioner confined to her London house during Covid, Dora is surprisingly cosmopolitan. She sets her fiction in Paris, London, LA, India, Australia and the Middle East, and her characters include backpackers, nihilists, delivery cyclists, climate-change activists, rightwing extremists, political prisoners, thugs and psychopaths. And \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 more writers! There are so many writers in here, in fact, that it feels like there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a David Lodge satire trying to burst forth. Dora has had lovers, children and some literary notice, but, at 73, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lonely and believes her work is no good and her career over. The pandemic hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped. She tries to lure strangers in for coffee despite social distancing rules, then quickly finds them dull. They find her weird and aloof. Dora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not-unreasonable worldview is: people fail each other, they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t love, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all poor artists, fakes and has-beens, and they live too goddam long. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, the Earth is dying. There are livelier moments. In Soho, Dora encounters a load of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hipsters, darting hither and thither, like a dance number involving portable coffees\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In an episode abruptly set in 1974, Mr Bhatt, a low-grade Indian public servant, decides that overpopulation can only be combated by rewarding the childless, taxing babies, encouraging suicide and enlisting the press to out the most prolifically multiplying couples as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Worst Family of the Week\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a more contemporary section, Barry, a hack novelist floundering over what to write, commercial fiction or heartfelt, jets off to a book festival in Australia to commit faux pas after faux pas. At his minimally attended event he manages to make offensive remarks about sexual molestation, disabled people and even Malala. Having binned a free tote bag full of books by his fellow writers, he then meets them in the hotel foyer and together they all watch as a cleaner drags a transparent rubbish bag full of their books out of his room. There are a lot of books thrown out in this novel: books trashed, dumped, shunned and despoiled. In The Imposters, books and writers are all on their way out. By \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imposters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, does Rachman mean hypocrites? He has skewered them in previous books, and there are certainly a lot of phonies here: writers who claim their fictional characters are more alive than real people; chancers who translate clickbait conspiracy theories for a modest living, apathetically inciting world unrest; leftwingers who quail when forced to mingle with genuine torture victims; and would-be environmentalists happy to fly halfway around the world, so long as they can eat sustainably once they get there. Rachman is observant about Dora, and novelists as a tribe: their urge to steal stuff from other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives, recycle their autobiographies, and pretend obliviousness to their habitual neglect and betrayal of others. But after clambering through Dora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fragmented story you begin to think The Mikado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s merciless Lord High Executioner might have a point: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And that singular anomaly, the lady novelist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be missed, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not be missed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just apply to female novelists. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The Imposters by Tom Rachman is published by Riverrun (\u00c2\u00a316.99).

Tuesday 23 May, Netflix *** Anna Nicole Smith: You Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Know Me A companion piece to the recent Pamela Anderson film, though this one is far darker. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same troubled childhood, rise to fame via Playboy, dodgy relationships with men (in this case ageing billionaire J Howard Marshall) and precipitous fall from grace. Sadly, Smith didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t live long enough to find the redemption Anderson has, dying at 39 of an accidental drug overdose. Ursula Macfarlane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s film is a fascinating cautionary tale, where success amplifies the worst parts of a personality (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bad pays better,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one interviewee) and luck can quickly run out.

Sinqua Walls and rapper Jack Harlow take on the Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson roles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and while they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the same star quality, they banter around the cliches and impress in the outdoor court scenes, as they aim for a big-money tournament that will cure their financial ills.

One snowswept autumn, a Moscow couple (Maryana Spivak and Aleksey Rozin) are preparing to separate but, with new partners already lined up, neither wants custody of their 12-year-old son. When the boy goes missing, and a volunteer search team get involved, they are forced to confront their self-centred, emotionally stunted ways. Despite being an intimate film, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a stretch to view the pair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s empty lives as a microcosm of Russian society.

Between the two deluges is a sharply observed summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day in the life of a Brooklyn neighbourhood. The uneasy cohabitation between groups comes to the boil at a pizzeria owned by Sal (Danny Aiello) where Mookie (Lee) works while trying to keep the peace. Amid the sparks lurks a nuanced take on racial identity.

In a picture-postcard coastal town he falls for Louise (Nadia Hilker), a young Italian studying evolutionary genetics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and his rootlessness contrasts with her interest in antiquity.

Backgrid, a California-based entertainment picture agency, said on Thursday it rejected the request, which was laid out in a letter from the Sussexes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 legal team, demanding it provide the images taken on Tuesday in New York City. The episode, which has echoes of the death of Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed when her car crashed while being followed by paparazzi in Paris in 1997, is said to have happened after the couple and Meghan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother attended an awards ceremony. Backgrid told the BBC the letter stated: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hereby demand that Backgrid immediately provide us with copies of all photos, videos, and/or films taken last night by the freelance photographers after the couple left their event and over the next several hours.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The agency told the broadcaster it had replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In America, as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you know, property belongs to the owner of it: third parties cannot just demand it be given to them, as perhaps kings can do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Perhaps you should sit down with your client and advise them that his English rules of royal prerogative to demand that the citizenry hand over their property to the crown were rejected by this country long ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We stand by our founding fathers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Backgrid and the Sussexes have been contacted for comment. Harry and Meghan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account has been disputed, with police confirming there had been no reported collisions, injuries or arrests, while Backgrid denied that the paparazzi behaved aggressively, even suggesting that the Sussexes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vehicle was driven erratically. A taxi driver briefly involved has also cast doubt on the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement.

He redefined his target on immigration after earlier in the week backing away from the Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 2019 manifesto promise to reduce it below the level then of about 220,000. Sunak said he would not put a number on the level of net immigration he would like to see but he wanted it to come down below what it was when he took over. Figures released in November show net immigration was 500,000 for the year to June 2022. Experts believe net immigration figures for this year could come in at between 600,000 and 1 million, prompting a backlash among Conservative backbenchers. Speaking to broadcasters at the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Sunak said he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crystal clear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wanted to reduce immigration, but when pressed on how far, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to put a precise figure on it but I do want to bring them down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The numbers are too high and we want to bring them down.

Again, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something I think we are proud of.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked by Sky News whether he could bring down net immigration to below 500,000 by the next election, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m committed to bringing down the levels of migration that I inherited, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m relentlessly focused on stopping the boats, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of my five priorities, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing absolutely everything we can to do that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sunak has repeatedly said he wants to bring down levels of net immigration but also defended the system of legal migration to the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When it comes to legal migration, the key thing for people to know is we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in control of why people are here, the circumstances and the terms on which they are here, making sure they contribute, to public services like the NHS, for example. Those are all now part of our migration system and they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t before,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The prime minister stressed that the difficult task of stopping \u00e2\u20ac\u0153illegal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd migration in small boats across the Channel was a bigger priority. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do think most people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number one priority when it comes to migration is illegal migration, that is crystal clear to me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s redefinition of the Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 aims on immigration put him at odds with the home secretary, Suella Braverman, and many on the right of the Tories. Braverman said at the National Conservatism conference this week that the party should honour its 2019 manifesto commitment to bring down net immigration, which was then at about 225,000. Adam Holloway, a Conservative backbencher, told GB News on Thursday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completely insane.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the movie star and athlete-leaden ownership group of the NWSL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Angel City FC in Los Angeles. But Mansour, who owns a global youth football development academy called Right to Dream, brings a unique proposition to the league. It was all feted at a splashy media event on Thursday at Snapdragon Stadium awash with local politicians, football supporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 groups, business leaders and an astonishing number of suit-with-dress-sneakers ensembles. As these launch events tend to go, there was no club-name announcement in sky writing (for now there is only the inspired \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSan Diego FC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 placeholder); no coach, kit, or star-player reveals. This was simply a welcome party, a baby shower for that aging couple who were finally able to conceive. Though MLS has expanded rapidly in the past decade, San Diego has been teased, talked about, leveraged and carrot-dangled as an expansion-team destination for even longer. But launching a sports team is rarely easy in big cities. When a stadium to play in was available here, various ownership groups couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t earn the bid or backed off with the emergence of nearby Club Tijuana in Liga MX. Then when prospective ownership groups seemed to have everything in place, the necessary soccer-specific stadium couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t materialize due to ballot measures and local political alliances that opposed it. A coupling of MLS and San Diego \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has steadily produced men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s US national team players for decades, and, by the way, sits right on the Mexican border \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was a no-brainer that seemed impossible to consummate. Eventually though, a new stadium was in place: San Diego State University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine-month-old, 35,000-seat Snapdragon Stadium. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controlled by powerful local stakeholders, is Goldilocks-sized for MLS, and located near the geographic center of the city, not the suburbs. The feel of this official launch, emceed by Fox Sports\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 affable TV host Rob Stone, was less of a self-aggrandizing gender-reveal party and more like relief, as if the wait was over. Nonetheless, confetti was launched, Ice Ice Baby and Can I Kick It? made obligatory needle-drops over the sound system, hype videos were played, scarves were gifted and worn onstage. At one point, Stone turned to MLS commissioner Don Garber. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These never get old, do they, Don?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd To which Garber flashed a smile and glow befitting a man who just secured a half-billion-dollar expansion fee. What, then, will an ownership group that does not own the stadium they will play in get for that hefty initiation fee into this single-entity league? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an intriguing question. The Mansour Group owns the Right to Dream player academy, which began in Ghana and expanded to Egypt, then Denmark. Right to Dream eventually purchased FC Nordsjaelland in the Danish Superliga \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and you can guess from where that club stocks its roster. Mansour and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSan Diego FC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 plan to establish a $150m Right to Dream academy in San Diego that can reach into Tijuana and beyond, taking advantage of Fifa rules that allow an academy located within 31 miles of a neighboring country to recruit within that country as well. The proposed academy will target players from this fertile soccer region at beginning at age 12, provide living quarters and education, with the eventual goal of stocking the San Diego team (and likely others) with its graduates. It seems an audacious but savvy business model, considering that MLS owns all its players\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 contracts and controls the player pool for the league. There has existed one large elephant in the room amid the buildup to the announcement, and during it: San Diego already has a well-liked men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soccer team. The San Diego Loyal of the USL Championship was co-founded in 2019 by a local real estate scion and Landon Donovan, who lives in the area. (A curious subplot is that Donovan, before starting the Loyal, was part of a previous ownership group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to land an MLS team.) The Loyal haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t only broken through in a city renowned for pro-sports apathy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the club is smartly run and has built a local soccer culture from the ground up in what many feel is the right way. And, being in San Diego, it has always seemed destined for bigger things if a partner with a lot more money were to come their way. Though it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the first time in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so-called #SoccerWarz that MLS shoves a smaller club out of its own market, it would be a bad look for the well-moneyed out-of-towners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not to mention the Sycuan tribe, locals for the past 12,000 years who can probably feel the unfairness of getting turfed out more than most \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to disregard the Loyal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s significant groundwork. Various suits onstage at Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event acknowledged the USL team and its supporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 group, and made pledges to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153listen to the community\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and such. Soon after, a small cadre of Loyal supporters broke into song. But MLS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stupid, of course. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d already unveiled a secret weapon to sway any wavering local support: baseball superstar Manny Machado of the San Diego Padres, who was revealed as a part owner of the team. (MLS has plenty of star co-owners around the league: Will Ferrell, Matthew McConaughey, James Harden, Patrick Mahomes and Kevin Durant, to name just a few.) Now that MLS has finally checked a long overdue box and the confetti has fallen back to earth, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fair to wonder what MLS will look like when San Diego FC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 kicks off in 2025. The obvious answer seems to be \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 more of this. The $500m membership fee is further validation of what appears to be the league\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actual business model. Its national TV ratings have always been modest. The energy and passion exists at the local level, at the stadium; people want to be soccer fans for a hometown team. And so MLS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest area of growth looks to be in actual growth. Expansion. More clubs, more cities. The league justifiably hypes its astonishing $250m per season streaming deal with Apple TV+. But now it can earn twice that in a stroke by adding just a single team. When potential owners are willing to pay at least $500m to join the league, why would MLS stop at 30 teams? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wonder these celebrations never get old. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can support even more teams in California,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Garber explained afterward from the mixed zone, in response to a question about the number of MLS teams \u00e2\u20ac\u201c four \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now in the state. (On the topic of expansion, disagree with Garber at your own peril.) After decades of waiting for MLS, San Diego finally has a due date. But for the next city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Las Vegas? Indianapolis? Phoenix? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a matter of time. And money."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/19/nationwide-to-pay-340m-of-profits-directly-into-customers-accounts", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "Nationwide to pay \u00c2\u00a3340m of profits directly into customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 accounts", "lead": "The first comes as jump in deposits and interest rates drives earnings up 40% to record highs", "author": "Kalyeena Makortoff Banking correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T07:28:41Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036052", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cd607861893eb8ed0c1cadf63f2e8651a510dcbd/35_10_4832_2901/500.jpg", "body": "Nationwide will pay \u00c2\u00a3340m directly into customer accounts for the first time, after a jump in deposits and higher interest rates drove annual profits up 40% to record highs. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest building society has tended to use profits to offer better rates on savings, loans and mortgages for its members but on Friday it launched an inaugural programme that will distribute funds directly to customers, akin to shareholder payouts made by banks. The payout, which amounts to about 15% of its annual profits, will benefit 3.4 million eligible customers, who will receive about \u00c2\u00a3100 directly into their accounts in June. The Nationwide chief executive, Debbie Crosbie, said plans for the payout were influenced by the recent rise in living costs: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anyone else doing this, as such, and we think, in the cost of living crisis, it was really important to get people cash where we could, and we think it will have the most impact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It comes as Nationwide reported a 40% jump in annual pre-tax profits to \u00c2\u00a32.2bn, topping its previous record high of \u00c2\u00a31.6bn a year earlier. The building society benefited from the rise in UK interest rates, which have climbed to 4.5% over the past year and allowed lenders to charge customers more for loans and mortgages. Nationwide also benefited from an increase in deposits, which rose by \u00c2\u00a39.1bn to \u00c2\u00a3187bn, at a time when rival high street banks reported outflows due in part to growing competition in savings rates. Its overall market share also grew to 9.6% from 9.4% a year earlier. However, a weaker housing market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has been hit by rising interest rates and living costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c affected mortgage lending, which fell by \u00c2\u00a32.9bn to \u00c2\u00a333.6bn over the year. Nationwide bosses said they were strategising around mortgage pricing, as they try to capture a larger portion of the market. They estimate that about 275,000 of their own customers will be coming off a fixed-rate deal over the next 12 months, and currently plan to offer new rates of about 4%. That compares with the average two-year fixed rate of 5.35%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the right thing to do to protect our existing customers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of retail, Stephen Noakes, said. Unlike listed banks, building societies such as Nationwide are owned by their customers rather than shareholders and are meant to be run in a way that benefits those members. The lender\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bosses said they now plan to make payouts to members every year, provided it does not harm its financial position. Crosbie said the distribution of profits \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is the biggest statement yet about how we use our financial strength to benefit our members\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. To be eligible, members must use Nationwide as their main current account and have one other product \u00e2\u20ac\u201c either a savings account or a mortgage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with a minimum \u00c2\u00a3100 balance. The mutual has also announced the launch of a new two-year bond product that will pay out 4.75%, surpassing the Bank of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base rate. Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s payouts come despite concerns over the UK economic outlook, which it said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153remains highly uncertain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It said the cost of living crisis and higher interest rates for borrowers had put further pressure on household finances, hit consumer confidence, and would continue to weigh on house prices and the mortgage market throughout the second half of the year. The building society put aside \u00c2\u00a3765m to cover a potential increase in defaults by struggling customers over the past year, up \u00c2\u00a319m compared with a year earlier. However, it said the number of customers falling behind on payments was still low given that many were on fixed rates and few had high levels of debt to repay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The transition to higher interest payments is a challenge for households as they adjust their expenditure priorities. We will continue to support those borrowers who face payment difficulties,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it added."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/may/18/uk-unveils-new-sanctions-against-russia-as-rishi-sunak-arrives-at-g7-talks", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going away\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Rishi Sunak announces Russia sanctions as he arrives at G7", "lead": "Prime minister will use Hiroshima summit to push more neutral countries such as Brazil and India into doing more for Ukraine", "author": "Rowena Mason in Hiroshima", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T07:08:14Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036056", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/63edc9f81a4dfee30ef19ab2b8493c7f51c31c9d/0_197_4793_2876/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has warned Vladimir Putin that western leaders are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not going away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they gathered at the G7 summit in Japan, with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, preparing to fly in to meet them. At a teahouse in Shukkeien garden in Hiroshima on Friday, the prime minister told Sky News: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Russia needs to know that we and other countries remain steadfast in our resolve to support Ukraine, not just in the here and now with the resources it needs to protect itself, but for the long term as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He told ITV: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just outlast us in this conflict. One of the common topics of conversation I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be having and have been having with my fellow leaders is about the longer-term security agreements that we put in place in Ukraine, to deter future Russian aggression.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said the message from G7 leaders to Vladimir Putin was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going away.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy is expected to arrive at the summit for an intensive round of diplomacy over the weekend. With Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war against Ukraine now in its second year, Sunak has said his main mission at the G7 is to shore up support for Kyiv, especially among countries maintaining a broadly neutral stance, such as India. The UK was joined by other G7 nations including the US in unveiling a swathe of new sanctions against Russia. Flying into Hiroshima for the three-day gathering of world leaders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and becoming the first British prime minister to visit the city destroyed by a US atomic bomb in 1945 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sunak announced a UK ban on imports of Russian diamonds and Russian-origin copper, nickel and aluminium, with other G7 members expected to follow suit. Seeking to push his credentials on the global stage after a bruising few weeks of domestic politics, Sunak also set out sanctions targeting another 86 individuals and firms linked to Putin, taking the total UK sanctions list to more than 1,500. Those newly sanctioned are described as being from the Russian president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153military industrial complex\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as well as some who are involved in key economic areas including energy, metals and shipping. The US had also promised fresh sanctions aimed at disrupting Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to get materials it needs for the battlefield, closing loopholes used to evade sanctions, further reducing international reliance on Russian energy, and narrowing Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s access to the international financial system, an official told the Reuters news agency. US sanctions would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cut off roughly 70 entities from Russia, and other countries, from receiving US exports by adding them to the commerce blacklist. And there will be upwards of 300 new sanctions against individuals, entities, vessels and aircraft,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the official added. A key task for Sunak will be to put pressure on leaders who have remained more neutral over Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine, notably the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. Before landing in Hiroshima along with his wife, Akshata Murty, her first attendance on an official No 10 trip, Sunak said he hoped to stress the extent of Russian war crimes to leaders from non-G7 nations including Modi and Luiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian president. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One thing we have to keep doing is talking to countries like India and also Brazil. That is going to be in that second part of the summit which is a good thing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sunak said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of my three things is talking to countries around the world and making sure they realise what is going on, the war crimes Russia is committing inside Ukraine and why everyone should support bringing about a peaceful resolution to the conflict. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what President Zelenskiy wants, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we want, and putting pressure on Russia to withdraw their forces so we can get to that outcome, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the consistent message that I will be taking to countries all around the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sunak and Modi will meet but it is not yet confirmed that this will be a formal bilateral meeting. Given the UK imposed punishing tariffs of 35% on diamonds and metals from Russia last year, massively reducing trade, the outright ban could prove largely symbolic unless it takes place in conjunction with other countries. The EU has previously stopped short of banning diamonds owing to the importance of the sector to Antwerp in Belgium. It is expected to instead call for better tracing technology for Russian diamonds, a commodity that earned Russia \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.5bn (\u00c2\u00a33.9bn) in 2021. Iron, steel, gas, oil and coal imports to the UK from Russia are already banned. As well as discussing Ukraine, the assembled world leaders, among them the US president, Joe Biden, will hold talks on Indo-Pacific security in light of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s threat to Taiwan, as well as nuclear disarmament, a key subject for Fumio Kishida, the Japanese prime minister, who is hosting the summit in the first city ever hit with an atomic bomb. The leaders are expected to visit Hiroshima\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peace Memorial Museum on Saturday. It details the destruction on 6 August 1945, which led to 140,000 deaths by the end of that year. In comments released before the summit, Sunak explicitly linked Hiroshima\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions in Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the sake of global peace and security, we must show that brutal violence and coercion does not reap rewards,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sanctions announcements demonstrate, the G7 remains unified in the face of the threat from Russia and steadfast in our support for Ukraine. We are meeting today in Hiroshima, a city that exemplifies both the horrors of war and the dividends of peace.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The summit, which follows Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s address to the Council of Europe summit in Reykjavik, is a chance for the prime minister to look beyond domestic woes following the Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 terrible results in this month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local elections, in which the party exceeded even its deliberately gloomy pre-poll forecast of 1,000 losses. Even heading to the G7, however, he has not been immune, facing criticism for being out of touch after telling reporters on the flight to Japan that people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s household incomes were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hugely outperforming\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd expectations and there were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lots of signs that things are moving in the right direction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the economy. Sunak met Kishida for dinner on Thursday night after signing a defence pact agreeing to consult each other on major military decisions. The summit is set to discuss the Chinese threat towards Taiwan, amid increasing belligerence from Beijing since the invasion of Ukraine. The prime minister also held a business reception for UK and Japanese companies, with Sunak claiming about \u00c2\u00a318bn of investment had been pledged."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/19/weather-tracker-italy-floods-exacerbated-months-drought", "primaryCategory": "environment", "title": "Weather tracker: Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s floods exacerbated by months of drought", "lead": "Torrential rain submerged the dried-out landscape of the Emilia-Romagna region, forcing thousands to evacuate", "author": "James Parrish (MetDesk)", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T07:01:30Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036059", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0e5b0e63659fa3f0d2afa40b11402fc8c252f982/0_368_3072_1843/500.jpg", "body": "At the start of this week an area of low pressure moved off the coast of north Africa, deepening as it travelled northwards across the Mediterranean before situating itself over Italy. Consequentially, much of the country received persistent heavy rain from Monday to Wednesday with the largest quantity falling over the north-eastern Emilia-Romagna region. Within a 36-hour period this region received an average 200mm of rainfall, although some areas recorded at least 500mm during the same period. Given Emilia-Romagna receives an average of 1,000mm a year, 50% of the annual mean rainfall falling in a short timeframe in a localised area has led to substantial flooding as rivers burst their banks. The flooding has been exacerbated by the previous months of drought conditions, drying out soils and reducing their capacity to store water. Extensive flooding submerged thousands of acres of farmland, towns and villages, resulting in thousands of evacuations with an estimated \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20m (\u00c2\u00a317.4m) in damages. Additionally, the Formula One grand prix scheduled for this weekend has been cancelled and at least nine deaths have been reported so far.

The record-breaking temperatures come as part of a large heatwave that is affecting much of the Pacific north-west as well as central parts of Canada. While this heatwave is not the most extreme the region has experienced, it has significantly contributed to the continuing wildfires in western Canada that have forced thousands to evacuate their homes. The amount of evacuations required was reduced earlier this week by a passing cold front, although strong winds did manage to blow wildfire smoke eastwards, leaving many central areas with poor air quality. As of Monday 15 May the wildfires had burned almost half a million hectares (1.25m acres). While wildfires are not uncommon in May, this wildfire has so far burned about 10 times the average for this time of year."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/19/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend", "lead": "End game approaches in the title race, Leeds and Leicester hear the clock ticking and Anfield celebrates a legend", "author": "Guardian sport", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T07:00:22Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036062", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b68c9f37179e7df86f61adc6dcab566d36544a52/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "1) A three-peat at the Etihad The permutations of Chelsea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit for Manchester City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s title prospects are as follows: if Arsenal win at Nottingham Forest on Saturday, Pep Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side have to beat their visitors to ensure a successful defence. A draw for the Gunners means City will all but retain their crown whatever the result against Chelsea due to a superior goal difference of 20, but a point will ensure this. And if Mikel Arteta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team lose, the Etihad Stadium will be in party mode from the start, the scene of the coronation of City as the three-peat English champions, an achievement only Manchester United, Liverpool, Huddersfield and Arsenal have previously managed. Given the rampant form of Pep Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side, the one scenario so far not mentioned seems highly unlikely: that, at the final whistle, Arsenal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge will remain live. Jamie Jackson Manchester City v Chelsea, Sunday 4pm (all times shown BST) 2) Partey the man to delay City party After last weekend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure at home against Brighton all but ended Arsenal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s title hopes, Mikel Arteta will be looking for a reaction to make sure Manchester City at least have to beat Chelsea on Sunday to secure top spot and their shiny trinket. They will get more of the ball at Nottingham Forest than they did in the defeat by Brighton, but will need to have a plan to combat the work of Morgan Gibbs-White behind Taiwo Awoniyi and Brennan Johnson. Thomas Partey came on for the final half-hour last weekend and his return to the starting lineup on Saturday evening could be imperative to Arsenal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gameplan. He has the tools to stop Gibbs-White but, without the Ghanaian at his best, the Gunners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 season could end with a whimper. Will Unwin Nottingham Forest v Arsenal, Saturday 5.30pm 3) Bamford key to Leeds survival bid If Leeds go down, denying Sam Allardyce a bonus of more than \u00c2\u00a32.5m, they will look back to Patrick Bamford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s penalty during their draw with Newcastle. They were 1-0 up and would have backed themselves to win if Bamford had scored. Yet his effort lacked conviction, allowing Nick Pope to save, and it could end up costing Leeds dearly. They are still in the bottom three before visiting West Ham on Sunday and they have to stop making errors at both ends of the pitch. An erratic defence is giving too many goals away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least Junior Firpo, dreadful at left-back against Newcastle, is suspended for the trip to the London Stadium \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and lack ruthlessness in the final third. Bamford, who has only six goals this season, has to step up. He has to get that penalty out of his system, and get Leeds out of trouble if he gets the chance. Jacob Steinberg West Ham v Leeds, Sunday 1.30pm 4) Ten Hag to weigh up Rashford risk Erik ten Hag cannot afford any slip-ups in the final weeks of the season if he is to make it a successful one for Manchester United. They sit fourth in the Premier League and face an FA Cup final against their rivals City next month, so it will be crucial to have Marcus Rashford fit and firing for the run-in. The forward missed last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win over Wolves but returned to training on Wednesday to give his teammates a timely boost. Without Rashford this season United have struggled in the final third and they lack the same pace and movement to trouble defences when Wout Weghorst isup top. The question for Ten Hag will be whether Rashford is worth risking from the start at Bournemouth, because a reccurrence of what kept him out last weekend could be damaging for United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects. WU Bournemouth v Manchester United, Saturday 3pm 5) An emotional goodbye for Firmino The farewell started on Monday when Liverpool fans spent much of the 3-0 win over Leicester singing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Si Se\u00c3\u00b1or\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the send-off for Roberto Firmino will ratchet up considerably on Saturday when Anfield gets its final chance to acclaim the Brazilian. James Milner is also making an honourable exit, along with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Ke\u00c3\u00afta, but Firmino will take centre stage against Aston Villa \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hopefully in a playing capacity, having resumed training this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and rightly. It is not the 109 goals in 360 appearances that explain why the \u00c2\u00a329m signing from Hoffenheim became one of Liverpool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most popular recent players. Nor a roll of honour that includes Premier League, Champions League, Club World Cup, FA Cup and League Cup winners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 medals. It was the intelligence, the audacity, the selflessness and ultimately the sheer joy that Firmino brought to the heart of J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Klopp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team that elevated him in Anfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes. The timing is probably right for the 31-year-old but this is not the moment for regrets. What a player. Andy Hunter \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Liverpool v Aston Villa, Saturday 3pm 6) Bentley aims for pole position at Wolves Julen Lopetegui was giving nothing away on Thursday when asked who will start in goal for Wolves at Molineux on Saturday. Daniel Bentley, a January arrival from Bristol City, impressed on his Premier League debut in defeat at Old Trafford last weekend. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 S\u00c3\u00a1, part of the Portugal squad at the World Cup in Qatar, has been one of Wolves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best performers since signing from Olympiakos two years ago, but a dip in form presented the Wolves head coach with the perfect opportunity to assess his options. Bentley was dropped by Nigel Pearson at second-tier Bristol City, where he was also club captain, and now S\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent wobble has given the 29-year-old an opportunity that few saw coming. Lopetegui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goalkeeper conundrum represents just the beginning of a busy few months of big decisions. Ben Fisher Wolves v Everton, Saturday 3pm 7) Eze can strengthen England credentials Eberechi Eze has been in excellent form since Roy Hodgson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to Crystal Palace. The midfielder has six goals in his past seven appearances and is in contention for an England call-up next week. Gareth Southgate is paying close attention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he was going to give the former QPR player a provisional spot in his Euro 2020 squad, only for injury to scotch those plans. The England manager also thought about taking the 24-year-old to last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup. Now, with Euro 2024 qualifiers coming up against Malta and North Macedonia in June, Southgate is thinking about Eze again. England are always on the hunt for technically gifted midfielders and Eze, such an elegant carrier of the ball, would have a chance of shining at international level. He is versatile, intelligent and skilful, and another standout display when Palace visit Fulham would surely make it impossible for Southgate to resist him. JS \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Fulham v Crystal Palace, Saturday 3pm 8) Spurs can show they are right for Raya Tottenham are looking for a new goalkeeper and Brentford have a very good one who is willing to leave, making this fixture a great opportunity for David Raya to show he is ready to step up. Admittedly, Spurs come into this match a mere two places and four points above the Bees but they can boast greater consistency when it comes to top-six finishes than Thomas Frank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side. Raya has shown he is a fine shot-stopper and is supremely confident with the ball at his feet, making him an ideal signing for managerless Tottenham. This could be where the problem lies, however, because Tottenham do not have a planned style for next season as a result of their lack of a manager and there will be plenty of demand for Raya. Rather than the goalkeeper auditioning for the club, it could be the other way round with Spurs eager to impress the man that could be their future No 1. WU \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Tottenham v Brentford, Saturday 12.30pm 9) Saints should accept fate and look to future The good news for Southampton is they have finally been put out of their misery and know they will be playing in the Championship next season. They have two more games to endure before waving goodbye to the Premier League and starting afresh in the second tier. It does give Rub\u00c3\u00a9n Sell\u00c3\u00a9s 180 minutes to try things out because it is highly unlikely he will be kept on as head coach, although stranger things have happened in football. Saints need to look to the future and that is certainly not the 33-year-old keeper Alex McCarthy. Sell\u00c3\u00a9s has the chance to recall Gavin Bazunu in goal to give him further top-flight experience and show whoever the new manager is that the club have a great goalkeeper for years to come, rather than rely on the past. WU Brighton v Southampton, Sunday 2pm 10) Magpies and Foxes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 role reversal Remember 2016? It marked the death of Shimon Peres and Fidel Castro, while music lost David Bowie, Prince and George Michael. It was also the year of the Fantastic Foxes, with Claudio Ranieri\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Leicester winning the Premier League to prove that, just occasionally, miracles really do happen. Things were significantly less joyous in Newcastle where not even the arrival of Rafael Ben\u00c3\u00adtez as Steve McClaren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement could prevent a club suffering under Mike Ashley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ownership being relegated from the Premier League. Seven years ago few would have believed that it is Leicester who are now staring at the Championship, while Saudi-owned Newcastle fight for a Champions League place. Who could have imagined that, having sacked Brendan Rodgers, Leicester would end the campaign with Dean Smith, while Eddie Howe would be thriving so far north of his supposed Bournemouth comfort zone?

The first stage of the Grand Chess Tour was a low scoring tournament, where the 30-year-old won two games and drew seven. It was a subdued performance compared to Caruana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s youthful peak at the 2014 Sinquefield Cup, where he won seven games in a row and recorded a 3098 rating result, which is still the best in history at elite level. The 30-year-old was never under pressure, and missed winning chances against his main rival, Alireza Firouzja, before and even just after the move 40 time control. Firouzja said he would have been losing after 41 Rc7! instead of 41 Nc4? As it was, Firouzja proved the most significant gainer from the event. The Iran-born 19-year-old began rustily following his break to follow an alternative career in fashion design, then surged to lead before dropping back. Only 12 of the 45 games at Bucharest were decisive, and Firouzja was involved in five of them. He also jumped to No 2 in the live ratings. Ding Liren and Ian Nepomniachtchi competed in Bucharest just a week after their bruising world title match in Kazakhstan, and fatigue badly affected their results. Ding even got within one game of becoming the first reigning world champion to finish last in a tournament, only escaping the bottom with a good final-round win against the Romanian wildcard Bogdan Deac. On Sunday the action moves to the Superbet Rapid and Blitz at Warsaw and the return of the world No 1 and now ex-world champion, Magnus Carlsen. Recently, Carlsen has been competing mainly at the poker table, but he also kept in shape for chess last week with an impressive victory in Chess.com\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Titled Tuesday. The Norwegian, 32, has abandoned his classical title, but has several other targets to attack or defend. He is the world champion in rapid and blitz so a strong performance is expected in Warsaw. There will be no showdown with Ding, however, as the classical world champion has withdrawn, citing fatigue after his gruelling marathon in Astana and his disappointing result in Bucharest. One week further on, and on Tuesday 30 May Carlsen will play his first classical game since January, when he is top seed at the traditional Norway Chess tournament in Stavanger. The Stavanger event actually starts a day earlier, when a blitz tournament decides the pairings. Stavanger will be a serious test for Carlsen. His nine opponents include the US trio of Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura and Wesley So; Anish Giri, who won at Wijk aan Zee in January defeating Carlsen en route; and a trio of ambitious teenagers. Firouzja, 19, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, 18, and Dommaraju Gukesh, 16, all have outstanding results which make them serious future contenders for the world crown. There will be another incentive for Carlsen on his home turf, pointed out by the Norwegian journalist Tarjei Svensen, who closely follows Carlsen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career. The gap on the live ratings between Carlsen and the No 2, Firouzja, is 67 points. His largest gap on an official list is 74 points, so a strong result in Stavanger could set a new record. This modest target is much more realistic than the Everest of a 2900 rating, which Carlsen has abandoned as too difficult.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what her problem is; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m making her run slower by being on my phone. She often has a go at me and questions why I go with her. I say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At least I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m bloody here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We go five times a week, though if it was up to me I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably only go twice. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t push hard every time, but I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that me going five times a week isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good enough for Jenny. She makes out that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m lazy. Guys, including bodybuilders, come up to me in the gym and say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your girlfriend motivates me to go harder.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She loves that. Sometimes I try to join in with Jenny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardcore workouts, but she never praises me when I do. When I work out in a more chilled way, or I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on my phone, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come over and drop a snarky one-liner like, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ha! Classic!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, then walk off. I find that triggering and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had fights in the gym before. I hate it when she comes up behind me and watches what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing on my phone, before making a comment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spying. The gym should be a place for me to unwind, too. Jenny prioritises the gym over everything. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been together for a year and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been like this. She will wake up early, do yoga, go for a run, then go to the gym. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unreal. She wants a fitness-fanatic girlfriend, and I feel inadequate next to her at times. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll suggest going to grab a coffee or meeting people in the pub and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make excuses, like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll reply: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, so no gym then?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still go. She needs to change tack or I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll stop going. The defence: Jenny I like to be in and out in an hour, but Janae wastes so much time I love going to the gym, but since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been with Janae I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made sacrifices when it comes to how I work out. The gym is my happy place, somewhere I can just put headphones in and be stress-free. Working out makes me feel better about myself. Janae also goes to the gym, but not in the same way as me. She comes to the gym to gossip with her friends, or waste time watching videos on her phone. I used to go to the gym at 7am, but Janae wants to go in the middle of the day or late at night. I prefer to get my exercise out of the way, and to relax in the evenings. Janae prefers to wake up late, have a coffee and go to the gym at 2pm. I think that is wasting the whole day, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in a relationship with her so I compromise. Sometimes, before we head out, Janae will say she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go, and I have to motivate her into getting there. I find that annoying. And when we get to the gym, Janae is often on her phone the whole time. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll offer to work out with her, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say she wants to do her own thing. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll look over later and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not doing much. I like to be in and out of the gym in an hour, but Janae wants to stay for two hours. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be ready to leave and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, can we stay longer, I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worked out that much.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been scrolling on your phone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just me who thinks that Janae\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour is ridiculous. She is known for wasting time. The personal trainers at the gym recognise us and often come over and ask: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you actually going to do anything today?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Janae needs to get serious when she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with me. We are both fit, healthy and toned. I am slightly obsessed with the gym \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I just think that if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re there you may as well be fully there and workout, rather than doing nothing. Why waste your time? The jury of Guardian readers Should Jenny leave Janae to her own workout routine? Reading between the lines, I suspect Jenny has some deep-rooted insecurities that get triggered whenever she sees Janae going at a different pace. Insinuating that Janae is lazy is unhelpful: why doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Jenny just go to the gym alone if it bothers her that much? Tim, 41 Jenny is not guilty. The two of them have different approaches to the gym, so why not go separately? I understand they want to spend time with each other but it is making the experience less enjoyable for both of them. Rachel, 37 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one thing to go to the gym together, another to try to force your partner to work out the same way you do. Jenny talks about compromise, but it sounds more like she views it as a sacrifice. Maybe you should let each other just get on with it, or even not work out together at all. These kind of judgmental remarks never foster a healthy relationship. Lou, 28 Jenny should go to the gym when it suits her and do her own workout rather than imposing her habits on Janae. If Jenny doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop being so judgmental it will create further resentment and undermine their relationship. Federico, 35 Jenny should stop making snide remarks. She has, however, made personal sacrifices so that they can go to the gym together. Janae is getting her endorphins from her phone, not from working out. So Janae should get off her phone or they should go separately. Sam, 30 Now you be the judge In our online poll below, tell us: should Jenny leave Janae to her own workout routine?

Step forward Thomas Negovan: the man who rescued Caligula. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There were definitely a lot of points in the last three years where I thought I was crazy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIs anyone going to care about this?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, in fact one of the most important entities in the industry, the Cannes film festival, cared very much, booking the new-and-possibly-improved version a premiere in its prestigious Cannes Classics strand, a section of the festival generally dedicated to celebrating the art of cinema at its finest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And so all of a sudden, I thought: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOK, all the therapy bills are worth it,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Negovan. Screened for the first time on Wednesday, the 2023 version is billed as Caligula: The Ultimate Cut, and Negovan is keen to point out that, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The thing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bizarrely unique about it is it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost like the version that was released in 1979 is the deviant version. Ours is closer to what was originally intended. Even the word restoration \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what word works, but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a restoration. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to call it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A quick recap for the uninitiated: involving more drama than every season of Love Island combined, the 1979 swords-and-sandals shockfest Caligula has long been infamous as one of cinema\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most disastrous productions, its very title a byword for what can happen when a creative project spins out of control. Starring Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, John Gielgud and Peter O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Toole plus a busload of porn stars, the lurid epic about the life of the mad Roman emperor Caligula, was a noble attempt to create the most explicit prestige picture in the history of the moving image. An anonymous crew member described it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a shoot, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Fourth Reich. Caligula Uber Alles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The finished film itself was hardly less chaotic. With finance put together by Penthouse founder Bob Guccione, a script by the leftwing intellectual Gore Vidal, and Tinto Brass, a cult Italian film-maker famed for his erotic movies, in the director\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, perhaps on paper the film had a certain sort of bold logic to it. Theoretically, these three brought to the table the unique combination of hedonism, intellect and wildcard creativity that the decadent, explicit, historical epic would need. What could possibly go wrong? Everything, as it turned out, starting with a rocky development period during which Vidal fell out with everyone over changes to the script, and essentially disowned the film. Vidal would eventually call Caligula \u00e2\u20ac\u0153easily one of the worst films ever made\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is quite the review to get from its screenwriter. Of course, the film didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bear much resemblance to the screenplay Vidal wrote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as director Brass announced airily during production, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re shooting right now is definitely not Gore Vidal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s script.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Producer Guccione also wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed and wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shy about saying so: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made the worst mistake in my life asking Tinto Brass to direct the film.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For Negovan, the biggest tragedy of the original film is that the actors were left high and dry when they stepped on set and again when the film was assembled in a messy and contentious edit. Mirren, whose character gives birth in stirrups that leave nothing to the imagination (on stage in front of an audience), called the experience \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an irresistible mix of art and genitals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd akin to going into Dante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inferno. Negovan believes that the original can fairly be described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the clickbait edit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the sense that all the most extreme line-readings were favoured over subtler moments, which is fun in the moment, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help the actors. His north star throughout the project was McDowell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, which he felt was particularly undersold by the original cut. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like, of course, Clockwork Orange is brilliant. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the same range that he has in Caligula. I feel like this is the best performance that Malcolm ever gave.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is something moving about Negovan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quest to honour McDowell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much the recut can do about the script and iffy camerawork, which are all part of the charm. But Negovan has unearthed a much clearer sense of a character arc, from Caligula as wary young man genuflecting to the mad emperor Tiberius (Peter O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Toole, on wonderful form), to a joyful freshly minted tyrant, through to the increasing cruelty and disintegration of his reason as he is driven mad by power. Modern audiences, attuned to reality television and the way that an unfavourable edit can create an entirely different version of someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personality, are well-positioned to be more sensitive to the effect that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clickbait\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd choices in the original edit has on the film as a whole. Which is not to say that this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the film fans know and love. Caligula\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strengths \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the elaborate sets (particularly the head-chopping machine), the OTT costumes, the beautiful way that it is lit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are still present and correct. As are the multiple orgies, the infamous fisting scene, the copious nudity and the genuine shock of some of the violence. At the Cannes premiere of the new version, there were some walkouts following the scene where Caligula rapes both bride and bridegroom at a wedding; anyone expecting a purely silly cult movie may be surprised at how dark and upsetting some of it is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and always has been. Caligula has an undeniable power to it, as an object as much as a film \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a fiction feature and a documentary of a particular place, time and confluence of different creative energies, and this new version is a compelling testament to that."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/19/cilmate-crisis-1-5c-degrees", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "If swing voters were terrified of the climate crisis, ministers would take it seriously | Gaby Hinsliff", "lead": "The effort to stay below 1.5C needs to be a battle people feel we can win, says Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff", "author": "Gaby Hinsliff", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T07:00:21Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036077", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a9f21f3c94992ee897a8f3578fbe81afe48d85fe/0_0_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "The end of the world is nigh, again. And as usual, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being greeted largely with a shrug. Perhaps you felt a prick of unease as you scrolled the headlines, or half listened over breakfast to some radio debate about the fact that sometime in the next four years the planet is likely to breach the 1.5C rise in global temperature that we have long been told is the tipping point to avoid. (Although this time the breach should be only temporary, the World Meteorological Organisation report stresses that it still takes us into uncharted waters, and if nothing changes the world is likely to cross this dangerous threshold more and more often in future.) Perhaps you even felt rage or frustration that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taking everyone else so long to wake up. But the chances are that most people will have forgotten it by lunchtime. YouGov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regular tracker poll finds Britons are still more worried about immigration, which almost a third consider the single most important issue currently facing the country, than about climate and the environment. Being a Nobel-worthy climate scientist these days must feel frustratingly like being one of those prophets of doom parading down the high street in a sandwich board, yelling at oblivious shoppers that judgment day is coming, with the exception that this time it really might be. If swing voters were as viscerally scared of flood, fire and catastrophic crop failure as they seem to be of people leaving Calais in dinghies, governments would be turning themselves inside out battling the rising temperature. Just look at the mad, economically self-lacerating lengths the Tories have been willing to go to for the past seven years in the name of supposedly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking back control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over our borders, and at how frightened Labour still is of contradicting them. Imagine if Westminster pounced on every global heating forecast like it will on next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immigration figures, expected to show another rise to record levels; if green issues stirred the same primal emotions as Brexiters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 blue passports. But though the nation says it cares when specifically prodded \u00e2\u20ac\u201c three-quarters of adults said they were worried about the climate crisis when asked by the Office for National Statistics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c somehow we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow through by punishing politicians who fail to deliver. Allow yourself to think about the potential consequences of our collective feebleness, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re terrifying. But for some reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c arguably because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re terrifying \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we mostly don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let ourselves think about it very often. A psychologist would argue that the brain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural defences against anxiety are strong, and in this case unhelpfully so. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hardwired to respond to imminent physical threats rather than abstract or distant ones; and, crucially, to run away from anything too big to fight. These survival instincts served humans well in conflict with charging mammoths, but not so much against the kind of abstract but existential risks potentially posed by the climate crisis, hyperintelligent AI or the prospect of antibiotic resistance rendering modern drugs useless. Add in our species\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 natural bias towards optimism \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the sunny belief that something\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bound to turn up, or that someone in authority will presumably be along any minute to take charge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we are stunningly ill-equipped to deal with pending apocalypses of any kind. No doubt the media could do more to shove this particular crisis in everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faces. But with apologies to those many Guardian readers who genuinely long to see climate issues covered in greater depth, journalists can lead a horse to water but they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop it drinking something more relaxing in its lunch hour. The joy and curse of online news is that every newspaper can now see exactly what people are reading: we know how many people skim the headlines of serious stories they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll later swear they read, before devouring every word about Phil \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Holly at war on the This Morning sofa. And the inconvenient truth, to coin a phrase, is that at the time of writing I can see more Guardian readers are engrossed by Harry and Meghan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battle with the paparazzi than by the breaching of the 1.5C threshold. Meanwhile, on Twitter, where users joyfully unconstrained by mainstream media agendas can post about whatever matters most to them, the current trending topics are Kylie Minogue and some basketball game in the US. Melting ice sheets? Meh. Some things are just too big to get your head around. What looks on the face of it like apathy may be better understood as being overwhelmed, a sort of sagging mental exhaustion; the same feeling that makes you collapse on the sofa with a takeaway again when you know perfectly well you would live longer if you went to the gym. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too late yet. The lesson from the pandemic is that people can be surprisingly willing to make sacrifices for the public good, if we think that everyone else is doing it and if the rewards are clear. Staying at home to save the NHS was, of course, the noble thing to do, but crucially it also made you much less likely to die of Covid yourself, and within weeks it was gratifyingly obvious that it was working as case numbers began to fall. The fight to stay below 1.5C needs to feel like the next national crusade, a battle we are capable of winning and which is therefore worth joining in. There is something oddly puzzling about this government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent reluctance to sing its own praises over net zero: Britain evidently isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decarbonising fast enough, but it still reduced its emissions faster than any other country in the world between 2010 and 2020, a success many Conservatives now seem strangely embarrassed to mention. Crucially, households need to know what is in it for them if they give up their gas boilers or petrol cars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which in practice means more generous financial subsidies and incentives to cushion the costs of switching, plus investment in the infrastructure to back it up, from car-charging points and battery factories to an army of properly trained heating engineers. But with one in five voters already saying they think the government spends too much on climate and environment policies, political parties won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk spending billions more without a clear signal that this really is how we want our taxes spent. And so we go, round and round in an endless circle of dithering. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rising global temperatures that threaten us in the end so much as the eternal human tendency to put off endlessly until tomorrow that which we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite face doing today. What the science is increasingly urgently trying to tell us, much as we may not want to listen, is that we can no longer be sure exactly how many tomorrows we have left.

Aside from a few lovely ballads, such as the sparse Buried and plaintive maybe-breakup song Come Back to Me, most of these songs feel anonymous.

The song that really sticks is the opener, Ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Enough Rocks, on which Clark writes vividly about a girl who conspires to kill her abusive father. Clark tosses off the song\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chorus like a grizzled onlooker: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There ain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough rocks to drown that pain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tantalising glimpse of the Clark that lies underneath."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/may/19/please-touch-norwich-sainsbury-centre-asks-visitors-interact-with-art", "primaryCategory": "culture", "title": "Please do touch: Norwich Sainsbury Centre asks visitors to interact with art", "lead": "Centre wants people to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrelease the power\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of living entities through interaction and lift museums out of Victorian era", "author": "Harriet Sherwood", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T06:53:29Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036085", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a84e0fe46778c9e7b69e9dd8cf1a583e88088585/0_649_4541_2724/500.jpg", "body": "Instead of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not touch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, visitors to the Sainsbury Centre in Norwich are invited to stroke the cool contours of Henry Moore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mother and Child, and urged to close their eyes and recall their first memory of being held and protected as an infant. In an accompanying guide relayed through an app, Jago Cooper, the centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive director, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Art isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a set of symbols to be read, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an emotional state of mind \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 If you can access that emotional connection, you can release the power of this living entity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1932 sculpture plays a leading role in what is billed as a groundbreaking concept at the huge museum and gallery on the edge of the University of East Anglia campus. The Sainsbury Centre is marking its 50th anniversary by becoming, it says, the first museum to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153understand art as a living entity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. According to Cooper, the museum world is a little bit stuck in a Victorian-era model. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That model is based on the idea that art and material culture is treated as property. A museum owns this property, and the public can come and benefit. But it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow you the real emotional power of [these] amazing manifestations of human creativity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cooper and his team have spent the past 18 months preparing ways for visitors to the centre to forge a relationship with art rather than simply looking at it. They can become a living exhibit in a glass showcase under 12 spotlights, surrounded by an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153audience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of sculptures and paintings. They can sway gently in a hammock beneath a suspended portrait by Alberto Giacometti of his brother Diego in what Cooper describes as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discombobulating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experience. They can listen to the sound of a 200-year-old M\u00c4\ufffdori flute, dance with first millennium Tang dynasty figurines, and create their own artworks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are trying to reconceptualise what a museum is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Cooper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want people to have a different emotional relationship with art. Great art is the physical embodiment of some of the greatest individuals, movements, societies and cultures that have ever existed. And if you can find a way of connecting with them, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an amazing experience.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Not all of the 5,000 works in the centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collection were suitable for touching and other interaction, said Cooper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lots of stuff will remain in cases, whenever we think conditions or contact with people could be damaging. But anything we feel can be and wants to be touched will be touched.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Henry Moore had told Robert Sainsbury, the centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, that anyone who thought they could sell his art without touching it knew nothing about sculpture, Cooper said. Continual touching of Mother and Child would give it a patina, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but that, for me, is part of the ageing process. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not trying to preserve it in a pristine state \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Art isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something frozen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Sainsbury Centre was created as a home for works collected by Robert Sainsbury, the son of the grocery entrepreneur, and his wife, Lisa. The younger Sainsbury introduced pensions and sickness benefits for shop staff and supported the postwar government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creation of the welfare state. The centre was designed by Norman Foster. In March, it became the first museum to introduce a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pay if and what you can\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd entrance policy across the board. Previously it earned \u00c2\u00a3350,000 a year from ticket sales.

The news was announced by guitarist Johnny Marr on social media, who wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Andy Rourke after a lengthy illness with pancreatic cancer. Andy will be remembered as a kind and beautiful soul by those who knew him and as a supremely gifted musician by music fans. We request privacy at this sad time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rourke played on the Smiths\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 classic back catalogue including hits such as This Charming Man and There Is a Light That Never Goes Out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both classic examples of his often boldly melodic style \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as on solo songs for frontman Morrissey after the group disbanded. He also played in the supergroup Freebass with two other celebrated Mancunian bass guitarists, New Order\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Hook and the Stone Roses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mani, and recorded with Sin\u00c3\u00a9ad O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Connor, the Pretenders, Ian Brown and was in the group DARK with the Cranberries vocalist Dolores O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Riordan. The Smiths formed around the partnership of Marr and Morrissey in 1982. Bassist Steve Pomfret joined, replaced by Dale Hibbert, who played the Smiths\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first gig but was replaced thereafter by Rourke, a school friend of Marr since the age of 11 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the pair had formed a short-lived earlier band, Freak Party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were best friends, going everywhere together,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marr said in a written tribute to Rourke. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we were 15 I moved into his house with him and his three brothers and I soon came to realise that my mate was one of those rare people that absolutely no one doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like. Andy and I spent all our time studying music, having fun and working on becoming the best musicians we could possibly be.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Smiths recorded their first demo in their classic lineup later that year, including songs such as What Difference Does It Make? which set out the core Smiths sound: waspish vocals from Morrissey, complex and ringing lead guitar from Marr, and a strident, technically brilliant rhythm section in Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, with Rourke in melodic interplay with Marr and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on tracks such as Barbarism Begins at Home \u00e2\u20ac\u201c playing funky bass solos. It was a sound that still defines British indie music of the 1980s, and it resulted in four classic albums \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Smiths, Meat Is Murder, The Queen Is Dead and Strangeways, Here We Come \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as acclaimed one-off singles. Rourke struggled with heroin use and was arrested for possession in 1986. He was fired from the band, rejoining after two weeks (his brief replacement, Craig Gannon, stayed with the band for a spell, moving to rhythm guitar). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You start getting a bunch of money and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what to do. You start spending it on drugs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rourke later said. Marr left in 1987, precipitating the band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s split shortly afterwards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When he left the impact was huge and I think we were all traumatised and probably still are,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rourke said in 2022. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one knew how to react. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know whether to call him or leave him alone. It was a really awful time, horrible, for everyone concerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rourke played on solo Morrissey songs in 1989 such as The Last of the Famous International Playboys and Interesting Drug, which Joyce said in retrospect was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a big kick in the eye for Johnny \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I felt like I had betrayed him so it was a long while before we spoke again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rourke and Joyce took Morrissey and Marr to court in 1989, arguing they were owed an equal share of earnings having only earned 10% each of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance and recording royalties. Rourke quickly settled for a lump sum of \u00c2\u00a383,000, while Joyce continued with the lawsuit and was awarded around \u00c2\u00a31m in backdated royalties and 25% thereafter; the case famously featured the judge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s description of Morrissey as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153devious, truculent and unreliable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rourke later filed for bankruptcy, in 1999. As well as the aforementioned collaborations, Rourke later played with another celebrated Mancunian musician, Badly Drawn Boy, and joined his touring band. His most recent project was Blitz Vega, a band with Kav Sandhu of the Happy Mondays. Tributes have been paid to Rourke online, including by Suede bassist Mat Osman who described Rourke as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a total one-off \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rare bassist whose sound you could recognise straight away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Charlatans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Tim Burgess called him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an inspirational musician with a style that made so many of us pick up a bass guitar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

But as its subtitle suggests, it is also a reflection on the political and scientific conflicts of the Covid pandemic, and the failure of contemporary leaders to coordinate a scientifically driven global response to the virus. Over millennia, biological and environmental imperatives rather than states and empires have shaped human destiny. Now capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degradation of the planet threatens our future survival. Zoonosis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the transmission of infectious diseases from animals to humans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has always bedevilled humanity, but the risks are increasing as we encroach further into natural habitats. The Global Virome project estimates that there are more than half a million unknown viruses with zoonotic potential; since 1980 sub-equatorial regions have experienced viral outbreaks every eight months; the Sars epidemic of 2003\u00e2\u20ac\u201c4 has now been traced back to dragon-tiger-phoenix soup, a combination of palm civet meat, chrysanthemum petals and snake served in restaurants in southern China. If these facts are sobering, the response of our politicians, described with measured fury by Schama, is terrifying: now as before, international cooperation founders as national tribalism belittles science and its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cosmopolitan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd practitioners. What can history tell us about how we got here, and how to respond in the future? The answer is conveyed through a meticulous retelling of a terrible yet scientifically innovative period, beginning with the cholera pandemics of the 1850s and taking in a three-decade epidemic of bubonic plague that by the 1920s had killed a staggering 12 million people, mostly in India. White, male, Christian European colonial authorities, obsessed with segregation and sanitation, doused homes with carbolic and limewash. When that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work they were forced to turn to outsiders: migrants, exiles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foreign bodies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the title \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who challenged prevailing social and scientific assumptions. Schama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s varied cast includes Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, the first European to inoculate her children against the disease in 1721 after learning the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Turkey way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of variolation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an early form of vaccination. We meet Adrien Proust, Marcel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father \u00e2\u20ac\u201c known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153geographer of epidemics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who travelled to Istanbul and Tehran, trying unsuccessfully in his 1873 essay on international hygiene to establish protocols for global public health. Exiles and \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s flit between the research institutes led by Robert Koch in Berlin and Louis Pasteur in Paris before dispersing across the globe to the frontlines of cholera and plague outbreaks in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great game of competitive medical imperialism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By the 1890s German, French, Swiss, Russian, Japanese and English bacteriologists, doctors and nurses were to be found at centres of contagion such as Hong Kong, Singapore and most notoriously Bombay. They went in order to research and deliver vaccinations, confronting terrible conditions as well as the ignorance and suspicion of colonial officials. But, as Schama notes, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just the officials who were suspicious. He deftly captures the paradox of medicine being seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poisoned gift\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of empire: while the bacteriologists saved millions of lives, they also rode roughshod over local mores \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in India there was horror at the mixing of castes in hospitals and the intimate examination of women, while others worried about animal matter in the vaccines. Schama even argues that the sparks of Indian nationalism that eventually broke the Raj \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unified social and religious outrage that coalesced into strikes and mass demonstrations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were struck during the plague of 1897. The central outsider in Foreign Bodies is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153culturally hybrid prodigy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Waldemar Mordechai Wolff Haffkine. A Ukrainian Jew, Haffkine took up arms during the Odessa pogrom of 1881 before becoming a protege of \u00c3\u2030lie Mechnikov, the founder of immunology. Haffkine eventually developed a cholera vaccine, which he tested on himself in 1892. It worked, and by 1893 he was in India inoculating 42,000 villagers, slum dwellers and soldiers a year. In 1897 he developed a plague vaccine in Bombay, once again testing it on himself, and created the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first large-scale vaccine production line. By 1902 more than 2 million Indians had been protected. In November that year, however, a contaminated bottle of vaccine killed 19 people in a Punjabi village. In what became known as the Little Dreyfus affair, the British authorities hung Haffkine out to dry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c exhibiting barely disguised antisemitism \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite evidence that he was not responsible. He was defended by the Nobel prize-winning doctor Sir Ronald Ross against \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the common enemy: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinstitutional barbarism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; the disrespect for science, the unconscionable inattentiveness to its illuminating knowledge, by those entrusted with public health\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Here as elsewhere echoes of the Covid era abound, leading Schama to a passionate defence of scientists like Dr Anthony Fauci. Something about the inoculators and epidemiologists, he writes, always gets \u00e2\u20ac\u0153under the skin of public tribunes for whom nothing, certainly not epidemiology, is politics-free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But if societies are to fortify themselves for a zoonotic future they will need to rely on exiles and \u00c3\u00a9migr\u00c3\u00a9s, cosmopolitan and liminal individuals, those benign \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foreign bodies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Schama describes with such careful attention. There are, in fact, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no foreigners, only familiars, only a single precious chain of connection that we snap at our utmost peril,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he declares. In doing so, he makes an urgent case for building a better future on our toxic past. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Jerry Brotton is professor of Renaissance studies at Queen Mary, University of London, and the author of A History of the World in 12 Maps (Penguin).

Cl\u00c3\u00a9ment, one of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prolific film-makers in the 1950s and 1960s, was 51 at the time of the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release. He died in 1996 at the age of 82. When asked who the biggest misogynist in Hollywood was, Fonda replied, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I plead the fifth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fonda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments come during a period of intense scrutiny on the French film industry during the Cannes film festival, with some women alleging that the industry continues to perpetuate misogyny and sexual abuse when the #MeToo movement forced a reckoning in other countries. Johnny Depp film Jeanne du Barry was selected the opening picture of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s festival after an ugly legal battle with his ex-wife Amber Heard. While supporters of Depp, who denies Heard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations of abuse, have celebrated the return of the actor, critics have accused Cannes of effectively handing a free pass to an alleged domestic abuser. Journalist Eve Barlow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reportedly a friend of Heard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c launched a social media campaign, #CannesYouNot, which charges the event with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153supporting abusers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and posted pictures of Depp alongside images of Harvey Weinstein and Roman Polanski, both regular Cannes fixtures in previous years. Earlier this month, Portrait of a Lady on Fire actor Ad\u00c3\u00a8le Haenel published an open letter announcing she was leaving the film business, slamming Cannes for being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the letter she cited \u00e2\u20ac\u201c among others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Polanski, who was convicted of statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977, and actor G\u00c3\u00a9rard Depardieu, who has been accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour by 13 women. Depardieu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers have denied any criminal behaviour. Haenel previously accused French director Christophe Ruggia of sexually assaulting her when she was 12. Ruggia, who denies the accusations, has been formally put under investigation for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the sexual aggression of a minor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Cannes boss Thierry Fr\u00c3\u00a9maux rejected Haenel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim, telling media: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that when she came to Cannes unless she suffered from a crazy dissonance ... But if you thought that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a festival for rapists, you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be here listening to me, you would not be complaining that you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get tickets to get into screenings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/19/poker-face-to-platonic-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "title": "Poker Face to Platonic: the seven best shows to stream this week", "lead": "Natasha Lyonne shins as a casino-worker turned PI on the run, and Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne have great chemistry as friends with no benefits in a new sitcom", "author": "Phil Harrison", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T06:00:20Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036105", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/091f2b3b4028eba1ad3a73c947d01814a7d9fbca/0_184_5401_3240/500.jpg", "body": "Pick of the week Poker Face Charlie Cale (Natasha Lyonne) is a beer-glugging casino worker with an infallible ability to detect lies.

May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kitchen shtick continues to be a mix of everyman bafflement and mild curiosity about more refined culinary techniques, only with a minor twist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c May is now edging away from banter in the direction of practical advice, albeit offered without any real confidence. Of course, May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incompetence is, in itself, a performance; but anything that gets more people into the kitchen is surely a good thing. Prime Video, from Wednesday 24 May *** Fubar For his first leading role in a TV series, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a deadpan but fearsome former CIA operative whose capacity for ultra-efficient violence is only matched by his dry wit. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lured out of retirement for one last job \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only to find himself working alongside a younger agent Emma (Monica Barbaro) who also happens to be his daughter.

The dark-wooden panelled interior with cosy nooks and crannies is dimly lit with red velvet decor and views across the Motlawa river over to the Old Granary building. Some rooms in this historic building are available for overnight stays. Rita My favourite tortilla, Madrid Casa Dani was a tip given to me by a Madrid native on the flight over. He noticed me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the obvious foodie tourist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c poring over restaurant entries and making notes from the guidebook. It turned out to be right behind our hotel. An unassuming-looking exterior meant we might have missed it but for the local knowledge. We ended up going back a number of times for the best tortilla ever (other dishes are of course available, but why would you!). Once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had the caramelised onions, no other tortilla will taste as good. Sally Smyth Ticks all my boxes, Croatia On entering the small resort of Milna, a few miles outside Hvar, you can spot a group of tables perched on a rocky outcrop right next to an idyllic, pine-shaded pebble beach. Restaurant Milina, a three-generation family affair, is renowned for its bell-cooked dishes (under a clay or iron) with lamb or gregada (a fish and potato stew) counting among my all-time favourites. Sipping a glass of wine while the sun sets, with the Mediterranean lapping gently at your feet and the kids enjoying a beach run-around until dinner is served: how many more boxes can you tick? Andreas Staab Best pasta ever, Rome Ristorante Nerone in Rome, just a short walk from Rome Termini station, is a cosy room reminiscent of a wine cellar (without having to go underground) with wine bottles lining the walls. Centre-stage is a 19th-century fountain that supplies free water to customers. We had the best pasta I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever eaten: cacio e pepe and amatriciana that was wonderfully simple and perfectly executed. A quarter serving of delicious house wine helped it all go down very well. The mid-range price is very reasonable for the setting and portion size. Amy Lawrence Amazing barley risotto, Slovenia En route to nearby vineyards in Vipava, in the inner Carniola region of Slovenia, we came across a charming eatery called Gostilna Podfarovz. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153light bite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suddenly changed into a five-course taster menu: cured meats, smoked salmon, beef tartare, the best barley risotto I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever eaten. We finished off with veal washed down with local wines. Unfortunately, we had no time for dessert as we were due at nearby Petric winery (also highly recommended). The taster menu was about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac55. Glesni Llwyd Vegan heaven, Athens The often long and windy road to veganism via vegetarian features many carnivorous pitfalls along the way. The taste sensation of fresh, healthy foods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c smoky pulled mushroom wraps and coconut milk-based feta Greek salads \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at Vegan Beat, a small and friendly vegan cafe in Plaka, central Athens, opened my eyes to the possibilities. Delicious, nutritious and varied dishes delivered on flavour. No compromise, just great food and reasonably priced. In four days I had five meals there. Robert Bound Dishes by the Danube, Vienna I lived in Vienna for five years and would regularly spend Saturday lunchtime at Das Bootshaus. It is on the Alte Donau (Old Danube), which is part of the river running through the city that you can swim in. A deck on the river is open during summer months, so my Saturdays would go as follows: a delicious paella, or a basket of fried calamari, washed down with a cold beer or spritz, followed by a dip in the river. The food is delicious and the setting is the cherry on the cake. Rosie The Reale deal, Turin We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d almost missed lunch by the time we arrived in the Palazzo Reale complex in Turin. The kindly waitress at the Caffe Reale in the courtyard told us they could knock us up a salad, the lunch menu having stopped by then. This being our first day in Turin, we were not yet familiar with the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slow food culture and were envisaging limp lettuce, tomato and cucumber. What arrived, though, was similar to an exquisite salad ni\u00c3\u00a7oise. We ate under the courtyard arches, shaded from the sunshine, ignoring the courting couple at the next table. Alison Vegan treats, Porto, Portugal Em Carne Viva in Porto is a truly magical place that offers an exquisitely crafted food experience while being incredibly relaxed and easy going, as if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re at your friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house. Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the setting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a wonderful family townhouse and garden (with cat). Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the kitchen putting together food so exceptional you have to remind yourself it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vegan (delivered in 10 or five plate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80/\u00e2\u201a\u00ac45 respectively). Or perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the hosts, who treated our evening with professionalism, kindness and humour. Whatever it is, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be planning your return after the very first moment. Ben Winning tip: A delight for the senses, Piedmont, Italy Nestled in the hills of Piedmont south-east of Turin near Cessole is a small, family-run restaurant called Madonna della Neve. There is no menu. The nonna in the kitchen sends out succulent dishes on large platters to be accepted or declined (rarely the latter) by diners. From melt-in-your-mouth carpaccio slices with salty parmesan flakes, to courgette flowers filled with creamy ricotta, each dish is an absolute delight for the senses. The pi\u00c3\u00a8ce de r\u00c3\u00a9sistance: butter and sage agnolotti traditionally served on a napkin. Come dessert, the owners leave a bottle of limoncello on the table promising a jolly ending to an unforgettable feast.

A smile crosses Stefanos Tsiandis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face when talk turns to a poll that has been as low-key as it is unpredictable. As a first-time voter, the 19-year-old knows exactly which party he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be rooting for when he casts his ballot on Sunday. But that, he adds, is rare. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our vote counts, and mine will go to Pasok,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the economics student, proudly posing with the flag of the centre-left party he has just waved vigorously at a campaign rally beneath the Acropolis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disgusting how they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making all these promises to win our support. It says so much about our political system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really exciting. Maybe a lot are undecided, but you can be sure they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be backing the [centre-right] government.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For the first time in years, Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election will be held under a system of proportional representation, making it nigh impossible for any party to garner the majority in Athens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 300-seat parliament necessary to win outright. With an inconclusive result likely, a follow-up poll in early July, conducted under an electoral system that would distribute bonus seats to the winner, is seen as inevitable. But less than three months after 57 people died in central Greece after a head-on collision between a freight train and a passenger train that many believe could have been avoided, the race in which Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centre-right government is defending its majority is tighter than expected. And with surveys estimating as many as 13% of the 8.5 million-strong electorate still undecided, every vote counts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because the train was full of students returning from vacation, the accident unleashed a huge emotional reaction among that segment of the population,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the veteran political commentator Pavlos Tzimas of the mass protests that followed the disaster. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And women and young Greeks account for a sizeable proportion of the undecided bloc.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the more than 40 years since Tzimas began observing general elections in Greece, the run-up to Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poll marked the first time, he said, that political party leaders had sought to appear on lifestyle TV chatshows that were popular with both demographics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their vote could make a difference, and politicians are nervous about what they will do,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen them vying with each other to get interviews on shows they might ordinarily never appear on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd New Democracy, Mitsotakis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party, has led the polls despite its six-point edge over Syriza, the leftist main opposition party, being dented by a wiretapping scandal and the February rail crash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a tragedy that took a wrecking ball to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reformist narrative. Forced on to the defensive, the 55-year-old leader was compelled to delay the election after acknowledging that the accident could have been prevented if proper safety measures had been enforced. Only three EU countries allow people under 18 to vote. In Greece, 17-year-olds (and 16-year-olds who turn 17 in the election year) were enfranchised under legislation passed by Alexis Tsipras, the Syriza leader catapulted into office on a radical agenda in 2015. Tsipras, like Mitsotakis, has also taken to TikTok and YouTube to woo first-time voters. While the government has pledged to hand out a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 (\u00c2\u00a3130) youth pass \u00e2\u20ac\u201c announcing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming of age\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd benefit barely two weeks before the poll \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Syriza has sought to entice the younger generation by promising to scrap tough university entry requirements. Low-interest loans for home purchases for 18-39-year-olds have also been announced. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope they keep their promises,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Stella Papaconstantinou, who has yet to turn 17 but because she was born in 2006 will be able to cast a ballot on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decided who I will vote for. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been trying to watch the news to be able to make a decision, but in all honesty am not sure I should have been given this right at this age. I would have liked to have been a bit more mature.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mitsotakis has sought to emphasise the economic headway that Greece has made under his stewardship since the height of its debt crisis and near-ejection from the euro zone. In a campaign that has projected his party as the only stable option in an increasingly uncertain world, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spectacular return to growth, backed by falling joblessness, a rebound in tourism, foreign investment and digitisation of the public sector have all been highlighted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always believed that two four-year terms are required for someone to change Greece,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said last month, admitting that mistakes had been made since he assumed office in July 2019. Tsipras, 48, has by contrast highlighted the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s democratic backslide under Mitsotakis, calling the wiretapping scandal that included security services eavesdropping on Pasok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Nikos Androulakis, a disgrace. Tsipras has vowed to combat inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c blaming the cost of living crisis on vested interests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and improve the wages of the public sector and health workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Greece has Bulgarian wages and British prices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said last week. Androulakis, who could emerge as kingmaker, has refused to back either Mitsotakis or Tsipras in a coalition government. But few pledges appear to light the fire of younger Greeks. With youth unemployment nudging 25%, many say that if they can, they will join the 500,000 who fled overseas during the debt crisis. In a campaign that has been noticeably bereft of debate about the future, despite Greece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ageing population, pollsters believe it will be a miracle if the vast majority of newly enfranchised Greeks vote at all. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the lost generation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Maria Tsiandis, at 22, Stefanos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elder sister. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First there was the crisis, then the pandemic; so much lost time and dreams that no government can make up for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/19/friday-briefing-are-appetite-suppressing-drugs-really-a-fast-track-to-weight-loss", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Friday briefing: Are appetite-suppressing drugs really a fast track to weight loss?", "lead": "In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newsletter: Semaglutide has won endorsements from celebrities and expert drugs advisers and has gone viral on TikTok.

In the last year, a little known drug originally prescribed to people with type 2 diabetes has shot into the headlines. Semaglutide, sold by Novo Nordisk as Ozempic, has taken social media and Hollywood by storm. Elon Musk credited his new body to Wegovy, another brand of the drug, and celebrities like the Kardashians are widely rumoured to be using it to shed the curvy figures that propelled them to fame in the early 2010s. Ozempic is still only approved in the US for diabetes, though it is prescribed for weight loss. Wegovy on the other hand has been approved as a weight management treatment. Both drugs are owned by Novo Nordisk. Semaglutide suppresses the appetite by mimicking a hormone that is released when we have eaten, which then tricks the brain into thinking that the person using the medication is full. It is injected once a week, and while effective, can have a number of uncomfortable side effects, such as nausea, constipation and even a sense of disgust about food. However, for those struggling with their weight (in 2021 25.9% of adults in England were classified as obese), it has offered a route to weight loss without undergoing drastic surgery. The response to semaglutide, which has now been approved for the treatment of obesity in the UK, has been mixed: many have welcomed the new medication as it gives doctors more options to help people. Some critics however feel unmoved by this argument instead claiming that it simply gives people a cheat code to weight loss without the hard work. As always with conversations about weight, it is often as much about moral judgments as health. I spoke to health journalist Julia Belluz, who has reported on Ozempic and is writing a book on obesity, about how semaglutide is changing the way we understand weight loss. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right after the headlines. Five big stories G7 | Rishi Sunak has announced a UK ban on imports of Russian diamonds and Russian-origin copper, nickel and aluminium, with other G7 members expected to follow suit. Sunak also wants to push India and Brazil to show greater support for Ukraine. Health | Research by a fertility charity suggests that male GPs are less likely to refer eligible patients for IVF, raising concerns about access to the NHS-funded treatment. GPs usually make the initial referral to fertility clinics, meaning that they play a key role in access. Economy | Grocery bills that have increased by 20% over the past year are going to continue to rise, overtaking the price of energy as the driving force behind inflation over the summer. The poorest households will be hit the hardest. Italy | Floods in northern Italy have killed 13 people, with many people still reported missing. An estimated 20,000 people have been left homeless in the worst flooding to affect the country in a century. New Zealand | A 48-year-old man has been charged with two counts of arson after a fire swept through a Wellington boarding house on Monday night, killing at least five people. One of the charges carries a maximum prison term of 14 years and police have not ruled out more serious charges. In depth: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe people who were first in line might not be the people who urgently need it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Researchers noticed in diabetes trials that patients on semaglutide were losing significant amounts of weight, so Novo Nordisk, the company that owns Ozempic, began testing the drug for indications of weight loss specifically. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The big picture is that there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a drug that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safe and this effective for weight loss until now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Julia Belluz. *** The asterisk Like every drug, semaglutide comes with side effects and risks, including nausea, diarrhoea, constipation, dehydration, vomiting and headaches. Then there are aesthetic side effects like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ozempic face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a term used to describe the gaunt look after the skin loses collagen \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and hair loss, though this is because of rapid weight loss rather than the drug itself. In some rare cases, patients can develop a painful condition called acute pancreatitis. The recent use of semaglutide as a weight loss drug also means that a lot of the long-term risks are unknown. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US has said that pregnant people should not be using semaglutide, and anyone trying to get pregnant should stop using the drug at least two months prior to pregnancy. The warnings were based on worrying signs when the drug was given to pregnant animals, Belluz said, but the FDA believes the side effects currently seen are more likely attributable to weight loss than the drug itself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ultimately, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be carrying a foetus and losing weight, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not optimal, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re supposed to be gaining weight,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Belluz said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But really we have no idea how this plays out in [pregnant] humans, and we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have that data for years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite the lack of clarity on what this drug could do to women, the concerns have not been relayed in advertising in the US or in media coverage. *** The global food system It is important to look at the growing diabetes and obesity crisis in the context of a global food system that has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catastrophic for the health of many populations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Belluz. And the problem is felt most acutely by the poorest and most marginalised populations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in England adults in the most deprived regions have almost double the prevalence of obesity compared with the least deprived (36% compared with 20%). Among children the gap is even wider. In the US, semaglutide highlights some of the very inequalities that lead to the disparities in obesity and diabetes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of the places with the highest rates of obesity have the lowest rates of insurance, and they tend to be communities of colour, particularly in southern states,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Belluz said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems many of the people who were first in line for the drug, in Hollywood circles for example, might not be the people who urgently need it and are living with extreme forms of obesity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Musk was not obese before his weight loss, nor were any of the other stars rumoured to have used it. The increased demand has on occasion led to a shortage of the drug in the US. While these systemic issues need to be addressed to deal with the underlying factors, Belluz said that the people who are living with weight-related health issues need help now. Essentially it is not an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153either or\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd situation. Medical interventions should be deployed in tandem with policy decisions that address the environmental drivers of obesity and type 2 diabetes. *** The results There is not a uniform experience of semaglutide. Some people find it extremely effective, others don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a great response. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some people end up losing so much weight they have to go off the drug,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Belluz added. On average, people who were obese who were taking semaglutide alongside a healthy lifestyle lost about 15% of their body weight in the first year. The research suggests that weight regain is likely if patients stop using semaglutide. In the search for ever more effective medicine, new, different compounds are being trialed that are seemingly leading to even more weight loss, said Belluz. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On tirzepatide people are losing closer to 20% of their body weight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this is just the beginning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd *** An evolving discussion around weight loss The introduction of this drug came at a complicated moment, when there has been significant backlash against the diet industry and more and more groups have been pushing to decouple body weight and health. Belluz spoke to patients who were grappling with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Health at Every Size\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd movement and trying to embrace their larger bodies but who simultaneously knew that their weight was causing them some degree of health issues that the medication could help: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They felt conflicted about it because they did not want to participate in another form of diet culture.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Semaglutide is not a magic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153skinny jab\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or a simple shortcut to losing weight as it is sometimes portrayed.

This programme follows what is now, sadly, an established formula. The entertainer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career is outlined, salient points emphasised, and commentary supplied from TV insiders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all of which is interspersed with accounts from those who were exploited by him.

Inflation is leading half of Australian audiences to spend less on tickets and favour local events, according to a new report released by the Australia Council, which surveyed 1,318 recent attenders of cultural events. Of those surveyed who had attended an event in early April, 59% had spent more than $50 doing so, slightly down from 63% in both August and October last year. But one-third said the price they were willing to pay for tickets had lowered over the past six months, and 48% said they were attending events less frequently. Overall, 42% of respondents said they felt they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worse off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than they were a year ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c lower than the national average of 52%. But a generational divide is emerging, with those under 35 and adults with children feeling they are being hit hardest by the cost of living, the report found. Sixty-one per cent of those groups said financial pressures were affecting their ability to attend arts events as they had in the past, compared to 27% of those over 65. Discounts and pricing offers were playing a greater role in buying decisions overall, but particularly among people under 35 and those with children. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning The majority of older audiences, on the other hand, reported no noticeable difference in their financial circumstances. They also reported a steadily growing confidence in attending events safely as the threat of Covid-19 recedes, with just 16% of over-55s saying the risk of contracting or transmitting the virus was affecting their willingness to attend events, compared to 47% in August 2023. Respondents over 55 were found to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most likely audiences to experience no barriers to attending right now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with 78% of respondents aged 55-64 and 79% of audiences aged 65-74 saying they expected no barriers to attending arts events, making them most likely to seek out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenging, topical works\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the next 12 months, the report concluded. By comparison, under 35s have gone from the demographic most likely to have attended an arts event recently, to the least in just six months. Last minute ticket-buying, a trend that emerged as the country eased out of lockdown and one causing widespread problems in the performing arts industries, shows no sign of decline, with four in 10 saying they were waiting longer to buy. As the cost of parking, fuel, air tickets and hospitality increase, more people are also prioritising events that are closer to home. A perceived lack of time and a lack of energy may be playing an additional role in shaping ticket-buying habits, the report surmised, with people adjusting to commuting post-pandemic, as well as an increase in social events that compete with the culture sectors. Australia Council CEO, Adrian Collette, said the organisation was closely monitoring the impact of cost-of-living pressures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This research has also highlighted that art and culture continue to be seen as vital to community recovery, providing an avenue for healing, joy and social connection,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As we navigate the emerging socioeconomic stresses following the Covid-19 pandemic, arts, culture and creativity are more important than ever \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to our productivity, prosperity and to our wellbeing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report recommended arts organisations investigate introducing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pay it forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd system, so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people in more comfortable financial positions can purchase or subsidise tickets for people more affected by cost of living pressures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, or even a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pay what you want\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd option for low cost events."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/19/brittany-higgins-national-press-club-address-bruce-lehrmann-defamation-claim-abc", "primaryCategory": "media", "title": "ABC argues Brittany Higgins broadcast did not identify Bruce Lehrmann and could not have defamed him ", "lead": "ABC says press club address could not have been defamatory even if Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s identity already widely known", "author": "Tory Shepherd", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T05:46:58Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036123", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bcaec3205dd60a98028e5a316e81789bedc3883c/964_211_2112_1268/500.jpg", "body": "The ABC has argued that it did not identify Bruce Lehrmann when it broadcast Brittany Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and Grace Tame\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Press Club address and, even if it had, it could not have been defamatory The ABC says in court documents that if it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153notorious throughout Australia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that Lehrmann was Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 alleged rapist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers have claimed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then its broadcast of the address would not have caused or been likely to cause serious harm to Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation.

Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Lehrmann, a Liberal staffer at the time, was accused of raping Higgins, a colleague, in March 2019. He was charged in August 2021. He pleaded not guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and has consistently maintained his innocence. Lehrmann was not named in the NPC address, which reached about 560,000 views through ABC 24, the main ABC channel, and the ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s YouTube channel. Higgins discussed her allegations and she and Tame discussed sexual assault more broadly during the program on 8 February 2022. Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trial began months later, in October, but was aborted after juror misconduct. An inquiry into the conduct of police and the prosecution during the trial is ongoing. In his statement of claim, Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers argued he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153identified and identifiable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, that the broadcast invited viewers to speculate about his identity, and that he had already been identified in the media, as well as by people who worked at Parliament House and people he knew. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[It] was notorious throughout Australia that [Lehrmann] was the person accused of, and charged with, the sexual assault of Ms Higgins,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd his statement of claim said. The ABC has used that phrase to defend itself. It said Lehrmann was not named in the broadcast and it was not defamatory. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If as asserted in [the statement of claim], it was notorious throughout Australia that Lehrmann was the person accused of, and charged with, the sexual assault of Ms Higgins, then \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the matters complained of would not have caused, and were not likely to cause, serious harm to Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the ABC said. Anyone watching would know that Lehrmann was yet to face trial or knew he had not been convicted, so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accordingly it was not a proven fact that Lehrmann had raped Ms Higgins on a couch in Parliament House and that Lehrmann was entitled to the presumption of innocence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Viewers would also already have formed a view about Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation that the program would not have changed, the ABC said. Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement said aggravating factors in the case included \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an apparent contemptuous attempt to prejudice the jury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the upcoming trial, and that the ABC kept footage up even after the criminal proceedings were dropped. A concerns notice was served, the statement said, but there was a failure to apologise. The show went live so there was no chance to redact anything, and the ABC was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recklessly indifferent to the truth or falsity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the allegation. The ABC said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concerns notice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers issued to the ABC was not an actual concerns notice \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in that it did not or did not adequately inform the ABC of the harm that Lehrmann considered to be serious harm to his reputation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A concerns notice is a prerequisite to a defamation action, and gives the accused party a chance to make amends. The ABC sought more information, but said a second letter still did not comprise a concerns notice, so the defamation proceedings should be dismissed. The ABC also said it broadcast the address \u00e2\u20ac\u0153merely in the capacity of a subordinate distributor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, that it did not control the NPC or know in advance what would be said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The matters complained of were a fair report of proceedings of public concern,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said, adding it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public meeting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a matter of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Despite the coronation coverage being labelled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153despicable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by monarchists, viewers loved it and gave the national broadcaster an easy ratings win over the commercial networks.

Joining Grant on the ABC panel for the coronation, hosted by Jeremy Fernandez and Julia Baird, was lawyer and Indigenous writer Teela Reid, Liberal backbencher and monarchist Julian Leeser and co-chair of the Australian Republic Movement Craig Foster. The panel discussion lasted 45 minutes in the lead-up to the coronation and was over hours before the event itself. For his part Grant pointed out that the crown represents the invasion and theft of Aboriginal land. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the name of the crown my people were segregated on missions and reserves,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he explained on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Police wearing the seal of the crown took children from their families.

The man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name was suppressed until his next appearance in the Wellington district court in June. He did not enter a plea and was remanded in custody on Friday after his lawyer declined to make a bail application. Court documents showed the man has been accused of setting fire to a couch in the 92-room hostel, Loafers Lodge, on Monday night, before allegedly starting another fire in the early hours of Tuesday. The second charge carries a maximum prison term of 14 years. The police \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have not ruled out further, more serious charges in relation to the deaths at the scene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Inspector Dion Bennett in a statement after the man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest on Thursday. During a brief court appearance on Friday, the man paced and made agitated hand gestures. In an outburst, he said he did not light the fires and wanted to sack his lawyer. Judge Jan Kelly granted the man interim name suppression to avoid prejudicing his right to a fair trial. Dozens of boarding house residents fled their beds after the fire erupted on Tuesday, with some jumping from windows and five rescued from the roof. On Friday one person remained in hospital. The number of people dead or missing remained unclear, with police during the week citing difficulties reconciling lists of those present and contacting those reported missing. Some residents of the lodge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which provided short and long-term accommodation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c left their phones behind when they escaped the fire, while others did not want to speak to the authorities, officers said. Bennett told reporters on Friday that officers had found five bodies in the 92-room hostel so far. Parts of the four-storey building\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third floor were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite dangerous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said, and investigators had been unable to enter those areas. Bennett was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reluctant to confirm the specific number of deceased and unaccounted for\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but the number of those missing was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153less than 10\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said. The fire service had earlier confirmed at least six had been killed. Bennett would not explain why the figures were different. Loafers Lodge had about 100 people staying there when the fire broke out. It is located in Newtown, near Wellington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central city. It had a mix of tenants, including nurses at the nearby hospital and other shift workers, clients of Wellington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social agencies, and several people being supervised by the Department of Corrections. The deadly fire has prompted government lawmakers to promise an examination of the regulations governing such buildings. Four of the bodies found in the charred boarding house had been removed from the scene, Bennett said on Friday. A victim identification process was under way. None of those killed or missing had yet been formally named."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/19/tv-tonight-jack-whitehall-and-his-dad-visit-chris-and-rosie-ramsay", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "title": "TV tonight: Jack Whitehall and his dad visit Chris and Rosie Ramsay", "lead": "As well as getting the father and son to open up, Chris and Rosie Ramsey get the audience to pitch in with their relationship revelations.

As the heavy early morning rain began to ease, the summit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s host, Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida, and his wife, Yuko, welcomed leaders and their spouses at the entrance to the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peace Memorial Museum, where they viewed graphic reminders of the attack on the city on 6 August 1945 and its gruesome aftermath. The Japanese leader \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose wife wore a gold pin shaped like an origami crane, a symbol of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear legacy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has said that achieving a world free of nuclear weapons is his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Joe Biden became the second sitting US president to visit Hiroshima, after Barack Obama in 2016, while Rishi Sunak is the first British prime minister to visit the site of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first nuclear attack. An estimated 60,000 to 80,000 people died instantly, but by the end of the year, the death toll had risen to 140,000 as more succumbed to burns and illnesses caused by exposure to radiation. Media were barred from the museum for the length of the visit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amid speculation over whether the leaders would visit only the building\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s east wing, which describes the dangers of nuclear war, or also pass through the main building, which contains photos of victims with horrific injuries. The group emerged from the museum after about 30 minutes and, led by Kishida and Biden, made the short walk to a cenotaph honouring the 333,907 people whose deaths have been attributed to the atomic bombing almost eight decades ago. Together, the leaders stepped forward to lay wreaths \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given to them by local schoolchildren \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on podiums in front of the memorial, with its eternal flame and plaque that reads: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The burned-out shell of the A-bomb Dome, one of the few buildings to have survived the attack, could be seen in the distance. After a moment of silence, there was a group ceremony to plant a cherry blossom sapling, propagated from a tree that survived the atomic blast. The leaders later met a hibakusha survivor of the bombing. On a morning steeped in symbolism, this was the first time the leaders of G7 countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including three that possess nuclear weapons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had visited the museum together. US officials said Biden, in a repeat of the approach taken by Obama, did not plan to issue an apology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a move that would go down badly in the US, where the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and, three days later, Nagasaki are seen as bringing the Pacific war to a quick end. But he and the other leaders viewed some of the museum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harrowing exhibits, which included burned and ripped clothes, the charred contents of a child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lunch box and strands of human hair from people who suffered exposure to radiation. Kishida, who represents a constituency in Hiroshima, said agreements on the need to realise a world without nuclear weapons were among his goals during the three-day summit, which is expected to be dominated by the war in Ukraine and China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing military and economic might. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will once again confirm our resolve to work for a world without nuclear weapons and we hope to transmit to the world our strong determination to protect the free and open international order based on the rule of law,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kishida told reporters as he left for Hiroshima. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope that here in Hiroshima, the G7 and leaders from elsewhere will show their commitment to peace, which will be remembered in history.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In keeping with Kishida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desire to place nuclear weapons high on the agenda, the summits final communique is expected to criticise Russia for threatening to use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Obama, who won the Nobel peace prize for his vision of a world without nuclear weapons, gave a speech at the peace park in 2016 and embraced a hibakusha survivor of the atomic bombing. But he spent only 10 minutes in the museum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lobby, where he was shown a small number of symbolic exhibits. Kishida has tried to move nuclear disarmament up the agenda for this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit and reportedly insisted G7 leaders visit not only peace memorials but also the museum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe the first step toward any nuclear disarmament effort is to provide a first-hand experience of the consequences of the atomic bombing and to firmly convey the reality,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said ahead of the visit to the peace museum. There is little enthusiasm for reducing nuclear stockpiles, however, at a time when Russia has issued thinly veiled threats to use them against Ukraine, and while North Korea is raising fears of a new nuclear test after a series of long-range missile launches."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/19/veg-box-riverford-staff-owned-founder-sells-stake-guy-singh-watson", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "Veg box firm Riverford to be 100% staff-owned as founder sells stake for \u00c2\u00a310m", "lead": "Exclusive: Guy Singh-Watson says he will continue to be involved in the business and will pay full tax on dividend", "author": "Sarah Butler", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T05:00:20Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036142", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d840eab6b651c598add65e3193a0cad49a3777f8/0_392_5918_3553/500.jpg", "body": "The organic vegetable box company Riverford is to become 100% owned by its staff after its founder, Guy Singh-Watson, agreed to sell his remaining 23% stake for almost \u00c2\u00a310m. Singh-Watson, who sold nearly three-quarters of the company to employees in 2018, will take a \u00c2\u00a39.8m payment over five years and immediately hand full control to a trust on behalf of its 900 staff who each receive an annual profit share and participate in the running of the business. The 63-year-old farmer said the deal, which will take the total paid for his shares in the business to \u00c2\u00a314m since 2018, did not mark his retirement and that he would continue to be involved in the business as a trustee, non-executive director and spokesperson for the business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Founders find negotiating this transition to their successors incredibly difficult and painful and most people make a bit of a mess of it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Singh-Watson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Founders can hang around too long, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be that person who needs to be told to go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the business became employee-owned in 2018, I wanted to ensure that the move was a successful one, and that the values of the business were safeguarded by its new owners and governance arrangements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since then, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a privilege to witness the business grow in ways we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have predicted, all while remaining committed to its founding purpose: to balance the needs of customers, suppliers, the environment, and wider society, and provide fair and rewarding employment to our staff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Singh-Watson said a proportion of the cash he was receiving would be invested in more solar power and agroforestry on his own farms \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in Devon and France \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with some going to the Ripple Effect charity, which helps farmers overseas, and local community projects in Devon. The sailing and surfing fan said he also planned to spend a bit of his payout on himself, but was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not remotely interested in fancy cars or boats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After much consideration and despite the example set by many politicians \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I have decided to make no attempts to avoid tax liability on the sale of the shares,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not set up trusts to avoid tax, even though much of the money will end up supporting charitable projects. I will pay my tax as others who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford creative accountants do, and I strongly support the idea of a wealth tax.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Singh-Watson said the shift to employee ownership had been influenced by the John Lewis Partnership, the owner of the Waitrose supermarket chain, which his farm once supplied. He expressed dismay that the larger company had been reportedly considering selling a stake to investors in order to raise cash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I suspect that would be the beginning of the end,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, urging John Lewis to stick with employee ownership and downsize rather than borrow large sums. Riverford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employee ownership deal comes after a tricky few years for the veg box company. Although it enjoyed a boom in orders during the pandemic lockdowns, many customers have since returned to shopping in supermarkets and local stores. Sales slid 12% to \u00c2\u00a397m and profits, before tax and payment of a profit share to staff, shrank to \u00c2\u00a33m in the year to the end of last month, from \u00c2\u00a36.2m a year before amid increases in the cost of produce, labour, distribution and energy. However, the group now delivers 65,000 boxes a week compared with 50,000 when it made the first move to employee ownership, while sales have risen by more than 50% in that time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Riverford is a powerful example of the potential that can be unlocked through employee ownership,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said James de le Vingne, chief executive of the Employee Ownership Association. Rob Haward, the managing director of Riverford, said staff ownership protected the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153values and purpose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a way that a sale to new owners who might have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite different motives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might not. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not being beholden to a small group of shareholders who want a quick return enables us to think long term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, adding that the arrangement \u00e2\u20ac\u0153makes for a leaner and more motivated business and the structure helps decision-making\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said trading had stabilised after the pandemic boom and subsequent retreat and there was now room for growth as concern about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protection of the planet and fair treatment of farmers is coming back into the consciousness of consumers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, the group was forced to put up the price of its vegetable boxes by about 5% in October, and Haward said it was likely to have to consider a similar price rise this summer as the cost of producing vegetables had soared."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/19/uk-households-with-communal-heating-facing-350-rise-in-energy-costs", "primaryCategory": "society", "title": "UK households with communal heating facing 350% rise in energy costs", "lead": "Surge in energy costs filtering through to low-income households on shared heat networks", "author": "Alex Lawson and Sarah Marsh", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T05:00:20Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036145", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5e156b16b8f8bd418c8655a2991ee02b261d22a6/0_354_5110_3067/500.jpg", "body": "Residents in council homes and private flats with communal heating systems are experiencing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nightmare\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rise in their energy bills, with households scrambling to fund increases of up to 350%. An estimated 480,000 households nationwide are affected, according to government data, as the impact of last autumn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surge in energy prices filters through to bills for this financial year. Many live in council-owned tower blocks, which house some of the lowest-income families in the country. MPs and local councillors said they were being contacted by distressed residents, and called on the energy watchdog, Ofgem, to intervene. Apsana Begum, the Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The cost of living scandal is having a devastating effect on our communities. I have constituents whose gas bills are being increased by 100% or more because they are on a heat network. This is clearly not acceptable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Simon Francis, the coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of people on heat networks are among the most vulnerable households. They deserve greater protection from the worst of the energy crisis, not least because they do not have the ability to switch supplier. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s incredibly concerning to see these people facing huge increases to their bills.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Buildings with heat networks tend to use energy bought in advance. This means the price rises experienced by most households last winter only started to affect buildings with communal heating last month, at the start of the new financial year. Meanwhile, the \u00c2\u00a3400 given by the government to every household to cushion the blow last winter is no longer available. Residents at the Bow Cross West housing association estate in east London said their heating bills had risen nearly 250%. They were told in a letter from the building owner, Swan Housing, the heating tariff would rise from 2p a kilowatt hour to 22p from mid-April. Standing charges, which are fixed and have to be paid even when no energy is used, have also increased. The changes mean the average heating bill will rise from about \u00c2\u00a316 a month to \u00c2\u00a357. More than 3,000 residents in council-run estates in Lambeth, south London, have seen huge rises in their heating charges since April. At Southwyck House in Brixton, residents were given four weeks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 notice to find an extra \u00c2\u00a360 to \u00c2\u00a376 a week to pay their service charge, which includes heating and hot water as well as other communal services such as cleaning and maintenance. Tenants in larger flats have been told the combined heating and hot water bill will rise from \u00c2\u00a3959 last year to \u00c2\u00a34,344 for the financial year ending March 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 350% increase. For leaseholders who own their flats, the council adds a 16.5% management charge on to all costs of servicing the building, including the heating and hot water. Tenants at Ward Point in Kennington have also been hit with a 350% increase, with the combined cost of heating and hot water rising in some flats from \u00c2\u00a3680 to \u00c2\u00a33,000 a year. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy price guarantee, introduced to help households last winter, caps the average bill at about \u00c2\u00a32,500. However, the cap does not apply to homes on heating networks. Heat network suppliers can apply for government help with costs, and are supposed to pass that to consumers, but the system has been criticised as opaque because bills do not always break down the taxpayer-funded discount. In a statement Lambeth council, which is Labour-controlled, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last year the council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term contracts meant we were able to keep costs low for residents, compared to the huge increases in prices for people with private heating. Unfortunately, these contracts are now over, and costs have increased in line with the bills that most people in the country have faced in the last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lambeth said it had directed \u00c2\u00a38m in financial aid to residents since the start of the cost of living crisis, and was introducing a further \u00c2\u00a310m package, a portion of which was set aside for council tenants. The Green party councillor Scott Ainslie said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lambeth did not prepare people in any way at all and it has shocked them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Under the London Energy Project, energy buying for Lambeth and 27 other London boroughs is handled by Laser Energy, a broker owned by Kent county council. It also buys energy for London-wide bodies including the fire brigade and Metropolitan police. Pre-tax profits at Laser Energy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediate parent company, Commercial Services Kent, rose to nearly \u00c2\u00a32m in 2022, up from \u00c2\u00a3960,000 the year before. Turnover increased from \u00c2\u00a347.8m to \u00c2\u00a356.7m. Residents at Bow Cross West said maintenance charges had also increased \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by 83% since 2019 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that the cladding scandal in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy had made their properties difficult to sell. One owner-occupier, who asked not to be named, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I bought my flat during the pandemic and the communal heating network was touted as an energy and price efficient way to heat our homes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve since seen my block\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy unit prices jump up by almost 1,000%, on top of cladding concerns that I found out about soon after moving in, which now makes my flat really difficult to mortgage and sell on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m basically stuck \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I feel like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m living a bit of a nightmare with all these bills.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Guardian reported in January that lawyers at Leigh Day are investigating the possibility of a legal claim on behalf of residents whose home heating and hot water are supplied through a heat network. A spokesperson for Swan Housing Association said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been a significant rise in heating costs nationally that has led to an increased charge to residents for communal energy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To keep these costs as low as possible, we procure communal gas and electricity in advance through Laser Energy, securing a lower than domestic market price. We understand the pressure of rising costs of living and our dedicated welfare benefits team is available to support residents struggling to make payments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/19/loyalty-tories-rishi-sunak-rebels-conservative-election", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "Loyalty has long been the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 secret weapon.

I asked why. Because, he said, you are too interested in politics. Stick to journalism. A political career was not about politics, but about loyalty. Never a truer word was spoken. As the tottering frame of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tory party heads for collapse at the end of this parliament, it is clearly suffering death throes. Loyalty, long that party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret weapon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, has deserted it. With an awesome electoral ordeal ahead, its leader Rishi Sunak had to watch colleagues and backbenchers alike attend a rally of an ultra-conservative US sect to discuss what Tories really believe, 13 years after they have supposedly been practising it. This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Conservatism conference, held at the Emmanuel Centre in central London, was blatantly a first run of a leadership contest presumed to follow next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election. Speaking were the shameless home secretary, Suella Braverman, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Lord Frost among other not so closet rebels. The Tories have found their own Tribune group. For senior figures in the party to publicise their impending defeat is bizarre. Throughout history, the Conservatives have faced the nation with a united front. Any leader seen as likely to lose was ditched, such as Harold Macmillan or Margaret Thatcher. Or they were supported with blind faith, like Edward Heath and John Major. When, under David Cameron, Brexit was the issue of the day, antagonists buckled under or left the party for Ukip. The leaderships of Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss destroyed this tradition of loyalty. Tory leaders would once have been longstanding friends. They would have socialised together and known each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strengths and weaknesses. An informal protocol would have guarded their confidentiality and commitment to each other. Only of Thatcher was this perhaps not true, but she carefully kept her dissident \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wets\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd within her tent. John Major too had his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bastards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but he faced them down and won their public support. Sunak as prime minister must face the toughest struggle of any since the second world war. He has inherited a nation stumbling out of a pandemic in worse shape than any in Europe. Its economy is ailing, its cost of living soaring and every public service is in disarray. The nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite state enterprise, the NHS, is in some respects facing collapse. As for the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 greatest achievement in a generation, Brexit, it is gradually emerging as a serious failure, its unique selling point, lower immigration, gone into reverse. On planet Sunak, no day is a good news day. After Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s massacre of the talents, the party was left bereft of able candidates to succeed him. The cabinet is composed of ministers of whom most would never formerly have rated any government job. Only Michael Gove would have attained cabinet rank in a normal government. Sunak himself was a mere junior minister four years before entering Downing Street. He has had to learn on the job. Nonetheless he has emerged as a competent, conscientious and, even at times, cheerful leader. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Keir Starmer has seemed uncomfortable trying to be rude to him at the dispatch box. Indeed, the chief accusation levelled at him is his loyalty to his former leaders. He must answer for all the evils of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, not to mention long Cameron, May and Truss. The prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest handicap is the lack of an experienced team around him. Lacking experience himself, he is devoid of staff seasoned in crisis management. Sunak lacks the cabal of old friends and associates on whom leaders such as Thatcher and Tony Blair relied and with whom they could relax. The 44-year-old cabinet secretary Simon Case appears to lack the confidence of his fellow departmental chiefs. There is no one with the clout of Thatcher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Charles Powell, Blair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alastair Campbell or even Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dominic Cummings. However misguided may be the clout, it helps absorb pressure and negotiate advice. Worst of all, Sunak has had no time: no time to weed his cabinet of duds and no time to resolve legacy nightmares not of his making. He is, or should be, haunted by fiascos over Belfast power-sharing, Brexit law revision, Post Office compensation, HS2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s costs and defects in EU trade treaties. He has no time to boost Tory fortunes in Scotland, where much of the coming election may depend. In all this the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 secret weapon is blunted and useless, tarnished by Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own disloyalty when tested to extreme in Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hour of need. The message of the NatCon rally is that the Tory hierarchy is no longer a club. Much like Labour of old, it has dissolved into policy differences that mutate into party identity groups. To put it mildly, Sunak looks like being the best leader the Tories have got. Given the odds against him, if he stops Labour achieving an overall majority, it will be a political feat little short of sensational. He would at very least deserve another chance. But if the antics of NatCon are any guide, there is little chance of that. The Tory party looks set fair for another period of tempestuous self-destruction.

Speaking to CBS, Marivi Roman Torres, who was traveling with her husband, Lu\u00c3\u00ads, and son, Alejandro, said the problem occurred at the ticket counter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At first [the Spirit employee] told me, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis is an international flight,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I asked her if there was anything that I can do, because I for sure know that I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need a passport to go to Puerto Rico. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is there someone else I can talk to? Can we call customer service together? They were completely inflexible, there was no empathy, they were like walls.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The family ended up going to the JetBlue counter, to be told a passport was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not needed to go to Puerto Rico\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and booked on a flight to Puerto Rico that day. In a statement, Spirit said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spirit has a long history of serving Puerto Rico and we offer about 25 daily flights to three destinations on the island. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In this specific case, an agent at LAX who is new to the position misunderstood the identification requirements. We are providing the agent with additional coaching and reiterating proper procedure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The low-budget airline added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sincerely apologize to our guest and their family for the inconvenience, and we issued a refund for the tickets and provided them with future travel vouchers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nevertheless, Torres said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do not think I am going to book with Spirit any more. I think that my trust was broken.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Puerto Rico, an island in the Caribbean, is a United States territory. Although Puerto Ricans cannot vote in presidential elections and do not have representation in Congress, they do not require a passport when traveling to and from the US. The incident prompted online criticism of Spirit. One user commented: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until Hurricane Mar\u00c3\u00ada in 2017, most Americans were either unaware or ignorant of the basics about Puerto Rico. To this day many don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the basics even if the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPuerto Ricans are American citizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fact has percolated more.

You learn that Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the USA in the third grade. The airline agent not knowing is one thing. The supervisor not knowing is inexcusable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a similar incident earlier this month at New Orleans international airport, Hertz denied a Puerto Rican man a rental car he had paid for, telling him he needed to present a passport. In video posted online, the man could be heard explaining that his driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license was a valid ID, only for an employee to refuse to accept it and threaten to call police. Humberto Marchand, who also spoke to CBS, said police showed up and asked him to leave before threatening to call immigration agents.

Spanish psychological thriller Muted is more like a black hole sucking in the occasional drifting nugget of narrative, destroying each one without trace. Rarely has such a serious-minded miniseries made so little sense. We open with two people: a woman, followed seconds later by a man, plummeting to messy deaths from the top floor of a city apartment block. Six years later, Sergio (Ar\u00c3\u00b3n Piper) is given early release from his juvenile detention centre: efforts to ascertain why he hurled his parents off their balcony when he was a teenager have failed, so a strange experiment is conceived. Sergio is allowed to return to the murder flat, but every room has been rigged with microphones and hidden cameras. As well as wearing an electronic tag, he is also being surveilled round the clock by a psychiatrist named Ana (Almudena Amor) and her team of investigators, who wish to study whether he is a danger to society. Why this ridiculously elaborate and risky scheme has been sanctioned is the first of many questions to which a satisfactory answer will not arrive. As for Sergio himself, we are told that his mental state remains unknown because he has not spoken a word to anyone for the entirety of his incarceration. This must be important, since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the source of the title Muted, or for Spanish-speaking viewers, El Silencio. How will the drama cope with this unique antagonist? How will it unlock the secrets of his psyche when he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hang on, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking to someone! Part of his parole conditions are that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s given moral guidance by an evangelical pastor, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chatting with the guy straight away! Oh and now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking to a young woman who used to write to him when he was inside, and who might soon embark on a potentially hazardous romantic relationship with him. So, the not-talking thing is in the bin: a series called Muted features a lead character who was mute before the events shown take place, but now isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Okey-doke. Pressing on, there is something amiss about Ana, who seems unduly invested in her observation of Sergio, as if she wants to prove him innocent rather than just map his mind. She sleeps on a sofa in the office and deliberately lets a shy male colleague walk in on her when she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in her bra, wet-wiping her armpits. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not just dealing with a maverick here; we have a horny maverick on our hands, and a show where the female character\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reckless, fickle desires will provide several of the most baffling moments, against tough competition. The covert op is, meanwhile, itself being overseen by a cop, Cabrera (Aitor Luna), who is conspicuously unhelpful, as if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been sent to sabotage it. But by whom, and why? You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re never going to properly find out! Muted is implausible and illogical in both its wider story arcs and its details. As characters conveniently appear by chance in just the right location, express surprise and alarm at the obvious consequences of their own actions, and display an awareness of facts they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly know, what might be expected to make the whole mess watchable would be an air of febrile, soapy camp. Instead Muted goes for the humming, buzzing, flickering paranoia of a 1970s US conspiracy thriller, a vibe it conjures convincingly: much of the key action is seen on grainy CCTV or heard through crackle and hiss, by people who are never sure if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the hunter or the prey. The atmospheric buildup of the first episode, when we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite know what is going on and so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wild bobbins, is excellent. After that, the decent direction and production design are wasted. While Ana obsesses over Sergio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every movement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is some truly silly business with the pulse monitor she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fitted to his ankle tag \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Cabrera schemes darkly, Sergio continues to visit his evangelist mentor, whose bald head, chunky ring and creepy demeanour mark him out as a gangster, not a true man of God. Bewilderingly he is also a market gardener, setting his flock of damaged young adults to work in a polytunnel. Clearly this is a front for nefarious undertakings, but of what kind? And will they interact coherently with the main narrative? Spoiler for the second question: no. Once that subplot and the one about police corruption have quietly imploded, we are left with Ana and Sergio. A lurid finale that will have you helplessly screeching \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But WHYYYYY?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the screen features a double twist, which is necessary because the first twist is patently impossible. Muted ends having failed completely to illuminate the criminal mind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the only shocking thing here is the script. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Muted is on Netflix."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/18/ai-cheating-teaching-chatgpt-students-college-university", "primaryCategory": "technology", "title": "My students are using AI to cheat.

In each case, the students confessed to using such systems and agreed to rewrite the assignments themselves. With all the panic about how students might use these systems to get around the burden of actually learning, we often forget that as of 2023, the systems don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work well at all. It was easy to spot these fraudulent essays. They contained spectacular errors. They used text that did not respond to the prompt we had issued to students. Or they just sounded unlike what a human would write. Our policy, given that this was the first wave of such cheating we encountered (and with full consideration that all students at the University of Virginia pledge to follow an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honour code\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when they enrol), was to start a conversation with each student. We decided to make this moment work toward the goal of learning. We asked them why they were tempted to use these services rather than their own efforts, which, for a two-page essay, would have been minimal. In each case, they said they were overwhelmed by demands of other courses and life itself. We asked them to consider whether the results reflected well on their goal of becoming educated citizens. Of course they did not. We also asked them why they thought we would be so inattentive as to let such submissions pass. They had no answer to that. But I hope we at least sparked some thought and self-examination. Sometimes that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all we can hope for as teachers. The course I teach is called Democracy in Danger. It was designed to get students to consider the historical roots of threats to democracy around the world. So it was not the proper forum to urge students to consider how we use new technologies thoughtlessly and what goes on behind the screen with a machine-learning system. But those are the most interesting questions to ask about artificial intelligence and large-language models. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to get these questions before my next group of students. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I am excited about the instant popularity of large-language models in our lives. As long as they remain terrible at what they purport to do, they are perfect for study. They reveal so many of the issues we too often let lurk below our frenetic attention. For decades, I have been searching for ways to get students to delve deeply into the nature of language and communication. What models of language do human minds and communities use? What models of language do computers use? How are they different? Why would we want computers to mimic humans? What are the costs and benefits of such mimicking? Is artificial intelligence actually intelligent? What does it mean that these systems look like they are producing knowledge, when they are actually only faking it? Now, thanks to a few recent, significant leaps in language-based machine learning, students are invested in these questions. My community of scholars in media and communication, human-computer interaction, science-and-technology studies, and data science have been following the development of these and other machine-learning systems embedded in various areas of life for decades. Finally, the public seems to care. As my University of Virginia School of Data Science colleague Rafael Alvarado has argued, these systems work by generating meaningful prose based on the vast index of language we have produced for the world wide web and that companies like Google have scanned in from books. They fake what looks like knowledge by producing strings of text that statistically make sense. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t correspond to reality in any direct way. When they get something right (and they do seem to often) it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s by coincidence. These systems have consumed so much human text that they can predict which sentence looks good following another, and what combination of sentences and statements look appropriate to respond to a prompt or question. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really the work of the library that we are witnessing here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alvarado said. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a library without librarians, consisting of content disembodied and decontextualized, severed from the meaningful work of authors, submitted to gullible readers. These systems are, in Alvarado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good at form; bad at content\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The prospect of fooling a professor is always tempting. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m old enough to remember when search engines themselves gave students vast troves of potential content to pass off as their own. We have been dealing with cheating methods and technologies as long as we have been asking students to prove their knowledge to us. Each time students deploy a new method, we respond and correct for it. And each time, we get better at designing tasks that can help students learn better. Writing, after all, is learning. So are speaking, arguing, and teaching. So are designing games, writing code, creating databases, and making art. So going forward I will demand some older forms of knowledge creation to challenge my students and help them learn. I will require in-class writing. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just take them away from screens, search engines, and large-language models. It will demand they think fluidly in the moment. Writing in real time demands clarity and concision. I will also assign more group presentations and insist that other students ask questions of the presenters, generating deeper real-time understanding of a subject. Crucially, I will also ask students to use large-language model systems in class to generate text and assess its value and validity. I might tell AI to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153write an essay about AI in the classroom written in the style of Siva Vaidhyanathan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Then, as a class, we would look up the sources of the claims, text, and citations and assess the overall results of the text generation. One of the reasons so many people suddenly care about artificial intelligence is that we love panicking about things we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand. Misunderstanding allows us to project spectacular dangers on to the future. Many of the very people responsible for developing these models (who have enriched themselves) warn us about artificial intelligence systems achieving some sort of sentience and taking control of important areas of life. Others warn of massive job displacement from these systems. All of these predictions assume that the commercial deployment of artificial intelligence actually would work as designed. Fortunately, most things don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. That does not mean we should ignore present and serious dangers of poorly designed and deployed systems. For years predictive modeling has distorted police work and sentencing procedures in American criminal justice, surveilling and punishing Black people disproportionately. Machine learning systems are at work in insurance and health care, mostly without transparency, accountability, oversight or regulation. We are committing two grave errors at the same time. We are hiding from and eluding artificial intelligence because it seems too mysterious and complicated, rendering the current, harmful uses of it invisible and undiscussed. And we are fretting about future worst-case scenarios that resemble the movie The Matrix more than any world we would actually create for ourselves. Both of these habits allow the companies that irresponsibly deploy these systems to exploit us. We can do better. I will do my part by teaching better in the future, but not by ignoring these systems and their presence in our lives."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/19/lambeth-council-tenants-in-precarious-position-after-350-service-charge-rise", "primaryCategory": "society", "title": "Lambeth council tenants \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcin precarious position\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after 350% service charge rise ", "lead": "Price hikes of up to \u00c2\u00a3300 a month for communal heating and hot water driven by rapid increase in energy costs", "author": "Sarah Marsh", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T05:00:19Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036172", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f7373d6bc958d7a7a301b7b8a0b53dfc322186b3/0_132_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Peter Shapcott is sitting in his council flat in Brixton, south London. As he examines the bills that have come out of his bank account, he hovers his computer mouse over a screen showing how much money is left. The 67-year-old, who is terminally ill, has been paying his rent through credit in his account from overpaid water bills. He has \u00c2\u00a3300 left, and now he must fund a steep hike in the service charge. From April, his weekly payments for rent and communal services such as heating, hot water and maintenance have risen from \u00c2\u00a3153 to \u00c2\u00a3214, leaving him scrabbling to find an extra \u00c2\u00a361 a week. The spike is being driven by a big increase in energy costs. Shapcott is one of an estimated 480,000 households nationwide occupying a flat where the heating and hot water come from a central boiler. Many buildings served by one of these heat networks are council tower blocks, which house some of the lowest-income families in the country. Their energy is bought in advance, so the rise in gas prices last autumn after the invasion of Ukraine is only filtering through to bills this financial year. And the \u00c2\u00a3400 given to every household to cushion the increase last winter is not on the table for next winter. Shapcott lives in Southwyck House, a Lambeth council block with a communal boiler. The heating charge for his two-bedroom flat is rising from about \u00c2\u00a311 to \u00c2\u00a337 a week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 236% increase. Hot water will go from \u00c2\u00a33.57 to \u00c2\u00a312.60 a week. He receives housing benefit, but this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cover heating and hot water. The rest of the extra money will have to come from his pension. About 3,500 people in Lambeth-run estates are in the same position. Many are facing service charge increases of between \u00c2\u00a3240 and \u00c2\u00a3300 a month, which is equivalent to about a 350% rise. The Labour-controlled council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice to those unable or unwilling to pay, in a letter sent out to residents in March setting out the new charges, was to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153end your tenancy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The council has apologised for the wording. Shapcott, 67, has a longstanding affection for the area, having lived in his flat for 40 years. He was given a home by Lambeth when he was ill with HIV. For that reason, the former charity worker does not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like to complain too much\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the council. He says the overall monthly rent is reasonable given the property\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size. But finances are tight and he is helped by a local food pantry. Shapcott points to his screen: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can see the credit [in his account] started shooting down when they put the price up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 And there we go. When you are on benefits, you are in a precarious position.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even going out to get a cup of coffee in a local cafe has become impossible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to think twice about things like that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. One of Shapcott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbours, living on the ground floor of Southwyck House, who asked not to be named as she used to work for the council, believes the price rises are unaffordable. The 74-year-old gets a pension, which just about covers bills, and has been visiting the food pantry to help with the cost of living. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rise monthly is big; some things have almost doubled. On top of that phone bills have gone up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why service charge has risen by so much. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just presented with a massive bill. For someone like me who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now retired, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really difficult. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a steady pension that only goes up a few pounds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scott Ainslie, a Green party councillor, says many residents are worried. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone anticipated an increase due to cost of living and fuel prices. Residents in the ward budgeted for a 100% or even, in the worst-case scenario, a 200% rise, but 350% is not manageable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lambeth did not prepare people in any way at all and it has shocked them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a statement, Lambeth council said the war in Ukraine had driven global energy prices \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to record levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Last year the council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term contracts meant we were able to keep costs low for residents, compared to the huge increases in prices for people with private heating. Unfortunately, these contracts are now over, and costs have increased in line with the bills that most people in the country have faced in the last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It said it has been directing \u00c2\u00a38m in financial aid to those who need support the most and was adding a further \u00c2\u00a310m, some of which was being set aside for council tenants."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/19/call-dementia-risk-included-uk-air-pollution-policies", "primaryCategory": "environment", "title": "Call for dementia risk to be included in UK air pollution policies", "lead": "Report urges actions to reduce exposure to pollution and for brain health to be in net zero strategies", "author": "Gary Fuller", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T05:00:18Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036176", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/543773a0f5eb7a77936a98875470990ab55e41f9/476_785_5386_3230/500.jpg", "body": "A wealth of research shows that air pollution is harming our brain health, including our mental health and our risk of dementia. A new report has outlined what we should do next. Prof Frank Kelly of Imperial College London, a former chair of the UK Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dementia is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, global challenge for health and social care in the 21st century. Recognition that air pollution might accelerate the decline in cognitive function and contribute to the development of dementia came as a surprise when such an association was first postulated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Logic suggested that air pollution would affect our lungs, then research found that circulatory diseases were also affected by poor air quality. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long for researchers to ask if other organs like the brain were affected as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Research in this area began about 20 years ago with the discovery of brain changes in pet dogs in chronically polluted Mexico City and the finding that these changes can begin in young puppies. Evidence accumulated over the past five years includes a study from Spain showing that air pollution can affect children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brain development and performance in tests. Research on 1,700 Londoners showed increased mental health problems with exposure to air pollution. Last year Kelly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department for Health and Social Care committee reviewed 69 studies and concluded it was likely that air pollution accelerated cognitive decline in elderly people and increased the risk of developing dementia. It is likely that damage to brain health accumulates slowly from the air pollution people breathe each day. The new report calls for an audit of existing policies to fast-track actions that reduce our exposure to air pollution through our whole lives, including low-pollution school zones and the development of dementia-friendly communities. The report also calls for health, and specifically brain health, to be part of net zero strategies. Prof Brian Castellani of the University of Durham, director of the new report, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A major step change is improving urban life, for example road congestion, green spaces, indoor air quality, ultra-low emission zones, biking and pedestrian lanes, as well as tackling health and economic inequalities. We also need policies to recognise that even legal limits of air pollution can be harmful and potentially worsen the situation of people living with dementia, neurodegenerative disease or early life brain health issues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/19/country-diary-heavy-metal-botany-on-the-banks-of-the-tyne", "primaryCategory": "environment", "title": "Country diary: Heavy metal botany on the banks of the Tyne", "lead": "<strong>Wylam, Northumberland:</strong> Why would a rare mountain flower be found here?

But in spring, an area of grassland about the size of a football pitch is enlivened by its blunt-ended white flower spikes, tinged mauve when they first open. Percy Thrower, whose TV gardening shows earned him celebrity status in the 1960s and 70s, would surely have had a theory as to why this montane member of the cabbage family thrives here. He often prefaced answers to botanical conundrums with the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the answer lies in the soil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that indeed explains why Noccaea caerulescens is abundant on the reserve. This is calaminarian grassland, a rare habitat contaminated with centuries of accumulated heavy metal deposits, washed downriver from mine spoil tips in the high Pennines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c arguably one of the happier outcomes of pollution, for this species at least. Alpine pennycress roots are comfortable here; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a metallophyte, safely accumulating zinc and lead at concentrations 30 times higher than would kill most plants. Its local abundance is the consequence of floods and an industry that began long ago, when people first learned to mine and smelt metallic ores. That might also explain why we found a morel toadstool here, in riverside woodland a little further downstream. This gourmet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delight, eagerly sought by fungal foragers in spring, has an affinity for heavy metals.

Maybe your Tina is the voice of the NRL, when in the 1990s, her cover of Bonnie Tyler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Best became the rallying cry of the sport and played a key role in reshaping the code\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image. The Australian Roger Davies, Turner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager, performed a kind of magic when he struck these deals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he wove Turner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s songs, all hard-won fire, into the national consciousness. (One of his current clients, pop powerhouse Pink, is more popular in Australia than anywhere else in the world.) Maybe your Tina lives on as Aunty Entity of 1985\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mad Max sequel; or as the singer of Thunderdome hit We Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Need Another Hero. Or maybe your Tina has been with you since PE class, where you learned a simple and downright irresistible line dance to Nutbush City Limits that became an Australian wedding party staple. (The dance recently trended on TikTok, baffling the rest of the world.) This voice that has soundtracked so many Australian rituals, and now we have a new way to celebrate it. Tina: the Tina Turner musical has landed at Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Theatre Royal after its 2018 West End debut and subsequent Broadway run, and with Ruva Ngwenya in the title role, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a goddess appearing before the faithful: we rose as one body, on opening night, to cheer for her. After the success of shows like Jersey Boys and Beautiful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Carole King Musical, you may think you know what to expect from a bio-jukebox musical: slick production values, positive spins on hard times, and all the biggest numbers. But like Turner herself, the musical defies expectations. To answer the most pressing question: the hits are there, and they are glorious. Led by musical director Christina Polimos, the band gets tighter and tighter until, by the end of the show, they could blow the roof off the Theatre Royal. But the numbers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always move chronologically, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little jarring when a song appears in her story years before she ever recorded it. Still, jukebox musicals don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be linear; you use the song where it best fits the story. The story is the challenge. Written by Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Katori Hall, with Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins, Turner served as executive producer and was key to the musical\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrative development. She has said that the process of creating the musical has afforded her newfound peace about the horrors of her early life, which might explain its surprising tone: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an exorcism. Racism, family violence, addiction, attempted suicide, financial ruin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all here, and it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t subtle. The book \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ambitious but clunky \u00e2\u20ac\u201c depicts Turner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trauma with care, but without politeness. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often hard to watch. The bio-jukebox style is often criticised for collapsing its star subjects into their most inoffensive, straightforward versions. To its credit, Tina avoids that: it is committed to honouring Turner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indomitable will to survive. It helps that Tim Omaji plays Ike Turner, whose addiction and abuse shaped Turner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early career. A grounded and emotionally present performer, he manages to portray a man often referred to by characters onstage as the devil without sucking all the air out of the room. Still, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure the audience knows what to do with the general approach; in multiple graphic scenes, we see Ike strangle and punch his wife and hit and push his child, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horrifying and upsetting. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also strange to hear crowds cheer for Tina when she responds with violence of her own. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Directed by Phyllida Llloyd (Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resident director is Leah Howard), Tina has a problem with tone and transition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it struggles to move from moments of despair to those of joy and growth within the vernacular of musical theatre. You can even see it in the choreography (by Anthony Van Laast, who choreographed the Mamma Mia musical film and its sequel): when it references Turner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own onstage performances, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electric and builds character; but when it comes to the big ensemble numbers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the business of commercial musicals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it feels silly and muddles the plot. The second act is much brighter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and funnier \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is disconcerting, but also a relief. Mat Verevis plays Roger Davies with refreshing lightness, and Matthew Prime arrives as Turner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next husband Erwin Bach, to usher in a new sweetness. It wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come together without Ngwenya, a revelation playing a revelation. She carries Turner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy in her throat. Her voice is powerful, supple, and mutable: depending on the song, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a prayer, a promise, or a weapon. Like Turner, she evolves. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not until Tina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career progresses and Ngwenya grows to a full-throated roar that we realise the whole first act was an impressive showcase of her balance and restraint. Can a musical contain beauty and ugliness at once? It can, even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwieldy. You see it most clearly as we watch Tina record River Deep, Mountain High with Phil Spector (John O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hara), an abuser himself. After a few lacklustre bars, he stops her. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sing to the god that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in yourself,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he tells her. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you know what that feels like?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Something shifts. She says that she does. And when Ngwenya opens her mouth and begins to sing, we know what it feels like too.

The premier, Daniel Andrews, on Friday announced sweeping changes to the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WorkCover scheme, including limiting support to workers who experience mental health issues such as burnout and stress to 13 weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you make a [legitimate] stress claim, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be provisionally approved, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get 13 weeks of care and support, but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to have those claims moving into lifetime benefits,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is still a very balanced scheme, a fair scheme and one that provides maximum support to those who need it \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 while [providing] pathways and a real sense of urgency to get back to work.

This is partially driven by mental injury claims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now representing 16% of new claims \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which Andrews said was never envisaged when the scheme was first set up by the Cain Labor government in the mid-1980s. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The nature of injury, the nature of illness and indeed the nature of work has profoundly changed since then,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen claims in this mental health space go from a very, very small number to what is predicted to be half the cost of the scheme in just the next six or seven years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Benefits paid to injured workers are also exceeding the premiums paid by business to fund the scheme by about $1.1bn a year. New South Wales dissolved its WorkCover scheme and replaced it with the scandal-plagued iCare, after it ran up a deficit if $4bn. The Victorian minister for WorkSafe, Danny Pearson, said that, without reform, the future of scheme could be in doubt. Also among the changes announced was an increase to premiums paid by businesses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from 1.27% of their payroll to 1.8% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will come into effect on 1 July. This is higher than the premiums in Queensland (1.23%) and NSW (1.48%), but lower than those in the ACT (2.22%) and Tasmania (2.03%). The test for workers receiving weekly payments beyond two-and-a-half years will also be updated, with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whole person impairment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rating of greater than 20% to be introduced. The rating measures the level of permanent damage caused by a workplace injury, which is currently set at 35% in South Australia and 20% in NSW. A new body, Return to Work Victoria, will also be established to help people re-enter the workforce. The changes have been met with criticism. The head of the Community and Public Sector Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Victorian branch, Karen Batt, said the government was undoing the reforms of Cain and could lead workers taking matters to court. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These changes will only increase the likelihood that workers will return to seeking redress under common law, undoing 40 years of support along with all the principles of original legislation from 1985,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153John Cain will be turning in his grave.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The secretary of the Victorian Trades Hall Council, Luke Hilakari, and the Victorian Chamber chief executive, Paul Guerra, stood together outside parliament to criticise the changes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When business and union stand together, you know this is a matter of importance for all Victorians,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guerra said. Hilakari said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very healthy thing that injured workers with mental health claims are coming forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also noted delays in accessing mental health treatment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a psychiatrist for anywhere between six and 12 months, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a psychologist anywhere between like three to four months.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The change to eligibility, which will need to pass parliament, will come into effect in 2024. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978.

The Greens MP Brad Pettitt tabled 58 letters of complaint written by the Aboriginal Legal Service of WA (ALSWA) and sent to the WA government, that he said showed young people in Banksia Hill and Casuarina prison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Unit 18 are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enduring worse conditions than those for most farm animals in the state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Pettitt read extracts from some of the letters, including one from 8 February, from a young woman on remand at Banksia Hill who alleged guards hit her on the head with chairs : \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Two male [youth custodial officers] \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 picked up chairs and hit [the child] on the left and right sides of her head at the same time with the two chairs. She had lumps on her head as a result.

She was then dragged along the floor whilst restrained,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pettitt read. The same young woman also alleged sexual harassment and misconduct by youth corrections officers: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153During her most recent admission in [Banksia Hill], [the child] asked [officer] to open her cell door. He moaned inappropriately (sexually) at her which made her scared. If [the child] screams, [officer] will often say things such as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI love it when you scream\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pettitt read from another letter. In a third letter, dated 21 February 2023, another young person claimed they were left naked overnight after threatening self-harm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[The child] threatened to hurt himself and YCOs ripped his clothes off and left him naked in the cell with a rip-proof gown, which in his distress [the child] did not put on,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pettitt read. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[The child] was left naked in the cell from about 2.30pm on 30 January 2023 until his visit with [his lawyer] the following morning \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 His mattress was covered in OC Spray and was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcitchy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. As such, he slept in the shower and he had only a rip-proof pillow and no bedding. He was very cold all night.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a different letter from 22 February, the child alleged he was often in the same clothes for days without being given new ones: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In around mid-January 2023, [the child] spent two weeks in the same clothes, being denied fresh clothing by the staff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pettitt said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vast majority\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the letters have gone unanswered. He said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153massive public health crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Banksia Hill youth detention centre and Unit 18 was getting worse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Frankly, so long as this state continues with business as usual, it is only a matter of time before there is a horrific and tragic, and completely avoidable death of a child in custody,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told parliament.

A Department of Justice spokesperson said that since 1 January 2023 ALSWA had raised 42 allegations of misconduct by staff at Banksia Hill and Unit 18 and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in every case, ALSWA was provided correspondence acknowledging receipt of the correspondence and the complaint raised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Department has closed 30 of those cases, finding that in 29 there were no disciplinary breaches. In one case an officer was counselled after an adverse finding. However, 10 are under further investigation and two are being assessed, the spokesperson said. ALSWA disputes that claim. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CEO, Wayne Nannup, said ALSWA has received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no substantive responses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in relation to the systemic and administrative issues, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153apart from some Professional Standards correspondence relating to individual staff. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All kids deserve to be safe and healthy. We are supposed to be rehabilitating these children, not inflicting ongoing solitary confinement on them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nannup said. The WA government is facing two lawsuits in federal court over its alleged unlawful treatment of juvenile detainees at Casuarina prison. There has also been ongoing unrest in both centres. On 10 May guards in riot gear wielding guns settled a major disturbance after dozens of detainees breached their cells and gained access to the grounds of Banksia Hill before climbing on to the roof. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, said detainees lit fires in several accommodation blocks and caused millions of dollars worth of damage to the facility, where about 90 youths are detained. McGowan described the incident at the time as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153form of terrorism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding that medical conditions such as foetal alcohol spectrum disorder were being used as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an excuse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for detainees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actions. On Thursday night, Pettitt said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153none of us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should dismiss neurological disabilities like foetal alcohol spectrum disorder as excuses, or label \u00e2\u20ac\u0153predominantly Aboriginal children as terrorists when they are enduring worse conditions than those for most farm animals in this state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/19/homicide-squad-officers-to-investigate-senior-constables-tasering-of-95-year-old-aged-care-resident", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Woman, 95, Tasered by officer at Cooma aged care home, approached on walking frame with a knife, police say", "lead": "Police said the officer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duty status was under review, as civil liberties groups demanded an independent investigation into incident that left Clare Nowland in critical condition", "author": "Christopher Knaus", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T03:35:31Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036191", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/93c10c5312c56e927caf6286718d4243a2ff32bd/0_9_1500_900/500.jpg", "body": "A frail, 95-year-old woman was approaching officers at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd using a walking frame when they deemed it necessary to deploy a Taser, leaving her fighting for her life in hospital. New South Wales police confirmed on Friday that the homicide squad was investigating the incident and that the senior constable involved, who had 12 years experience, is under review and no longer working. Grandmother Clare Nowland remains in a critical condition in Cooma district hospital, with her family remaining by her bedside for the past two days, after the use of the Taser early Wednesday morning, which caused her to fall, hit her head and sustain life-threatening injuries. Nowland is in and out of consciousness and police are treating the matter as a level one critical incident, meaning it involves \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an injury that leads to death or imminent death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Police initially released scant detail on the incident to the public, saying only that an elderly woman in an aged care facility had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustained injuries during an interaction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with officers, without any mention of the use of a Taser. On Friday, they said the use of the Taser was due to Nowland being armed with a steak knife. Nowland, who suffers dementia, had left her room in the early hours of the morning and gone to the kitchen of the aged care facility, named Yallambee Lodge, where she found the knife, police say. She was by herself in a small medical treatment room when police arrived. Off-duty officers had to be called in to respond (Cooma does not have a 24-hour police station) and they arrived some time after paramedics had been on the scene. Police say officers tried to negotiate with Nowland. They allege she advanced at them at a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow pace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, using a walking frame. Nowland is 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21222\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and weighs 43kg and is frail. Police have footage of the entire incident, sourced from body-worn cameras, but will not release it publicly. Peter Cotter, the NSW assistant police commissioner, described the footage as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confronting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said Tasers were intended for self-defence but said he could not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transport myself to the mind of the actual officer or officers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd involved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the time she was Tasered she was approaching police, it is fair to say at a slow pace,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She had a walking frame. But she had a knife. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take it any further what was going through anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind with the use of a Taser. That is for them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The internal investigation will be reviewed by NSW police professional standards and monitored by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No officer, not one of us, is above the law and all our actions will be scrutinised robustly and from a criminal perspective as well as a departmental perspective,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cotter said. The use of force on Nowland has prompted widespread condemnation and calls for an independent probe. Civil liberties groups on Friday demanded an external watchdog, such as the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, manage the investigation, rather than the NSW police critical incident team. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Police should never investigate police,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Josh Pallas, the NSW Council for Civil Liberties president, said.

In a short statement, the LECC said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The NSWPF are investigating the circumstances of the incident and the investigation will be reviewed by the Professional Standards Command. The LECC is independently monitoring the investigation under Part 8 of the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission Act 2016 to ensure public confidence in the investigation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Disability advocates and civil libertarians questioned the need to use a Taser on an elderly woman with dementia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The NSW ombudsman and the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission should initiate an inquiry into this because it transcends issues of police powers with mental health and ageing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pallas said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe need to ensure that no matter what the circumstances of this case that our elderly nursing home residents are protected. That includes protection from excessive police force.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nicole Lee, the president of People with Disability Australia, described the incident as shocking and said it highlighted the deficiency in training for police on de-escalating situations involving those with dementia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s either one hell of an agile, fit, fast and intimidating 95-year-old woman, or there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very poor lack of judgment on those police officers and there really needs to be some accountability on their side of this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lee told the ABC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This woman, an older woman of 95, she needed somebody to de-escalate the situation with her and to talk to her, and to handle her with compassion and time and not Tasers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yallambee Lodge, a 40-bed facility run by the Snowy Monaro Council, was reported to be under pressure due to high levels of occupancy, according to the council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most recent report. It was audited against the commonwealth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aged care quality standards in February and found fully compliant.

He radiated impish delight. Albanese was mentally pinching himself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c am I here? Is this happening? Have I actually pulled this off? Nearly 12 months later, Albanese sat opposite the British broadcaster Piers Morgan. The interview was a pit-stop on the way to the coronation of King Charles. The impishness of those opening weeks had vanished. Albanese was all business; the mantle of the office had settled on him. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31st prime minister is a lifelong republican. I suspect he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider Morgan a preening blowhard. But there he was, in London, indulging Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro forma pearl clutch about cancel culture and transgender issues (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is a woman, prime minister?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) before ducking off to swear an oath of allegiance to a septuagenarian who once aspired to be a tampon. Being prime minister is certainly a mood, a lark, a spree. But Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adventures are usually calculated. Without a plan, without patience, without a strategy, a scrapper from public housing in inner-city Sydney would never have ascended the goat track to the Lodge. Speaking to Morgan isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t genuflecting to Morgan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s connecting with his tribe, folks who like their bubble. Albanese is always looking to recruit, persuade or disarm people who get a say in his future. Growing your support base, pushing beyond the allies and acolytes to the agnostics, is a lifelong habit grounded in having to fend for yourself. Attending the coronation was obviously obligatory for any commonwealth leader, but also politically useful; an opportunity to show nostalgics in Australia that social democrats can respect tradition. Pitching yourself as having the manners to not roll your eyes at the establishment feast is a flex when there will be right-leaning Australians who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hand out how-to-vote cards if the Liberal leader is Peter Dutton. Although taking Nick Cave along to hereditary privilege\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest pageant in Westminster Abbey did feel like a wink to Marrickville, Newtown, Enmore, even if Cave harbours an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inexplicable emotional attachment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the royals. People who find Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flexibility either tiresome or suspect sometimes reduce him to a boomer cliche: a youthful militant extinguishes his own righteous fire as he tracks inexorably to the bland centrism of prosperous mid-life. And it is true \u00e2\u20ac\u201c provable in fact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics is less strident now than it was in the 1980s and 1990s. The teeth are straight and the suits are more expensive. Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public service isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t styled as a crusade. His pragmatism can frustrate people who feel, entirely reasonably, underwhelmed and unrepresented by the incrementalism and inertia of major party politics. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very reasonable to ask: what good is a revolutionary if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not kicking doors in? Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Albanese of 2023 is not an absolutist, but he remains an activist. Almost 12 months into his prime ministership, his abiding belief in the power of shared values feels pretty radical. Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s civic utopianism is out of sync with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153move fast and break things\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with Elon Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Twitter. He wants to nurture the inclusive commons; hack the algorithms, test the limits, not die wondering. This prime minister thinks he can entrench Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s curious, progressive character as the national default without triggering a societal rupture from people who fear the future. Politics can feel like the preserve of demagogues, vaudevillians and enclavists intent on prospering politically by vilifying opposing tribes. But Albanese wants to enlarge Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea of itself. The tempo might be measured, but he wants this enough to put his prime ministership on the line to achieve it. His desire to establish a First Nations voice to parliament is one proof point of Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big bet on our better angels. Albanese is somebody we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen in politics for a while: a prime minister prepared to have a fight for a measure of decency and justice. A fight that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not entirely certain he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll win. The importance of planning ahead For the past couple of months, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been out of Canberra, consuming politics like the rest of the country, which means glancingly if at all. Normally I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an avid miniaturist. Lately, on hiatus from the cloisters, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a landscape impressionist. Some impressions of the Albanese government 12 months in. An ensemble, not a one-man band; a group with a policy agenda being implemented with a minimum of cosplay. This orderly bustle reaches me in television pictures and the disembodied headlines pushed to my smartphone. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not chasing the daily news, feeding the beast, maximising the objectively inconsequential increments with my relentless political editor energy. At the moment, developments wash over me. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Albanese and Joe Biden in aviators. They must have landed Aukus. Labor won Aston? (Really? OK.) There goes the budget \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something about bulk billing and Jim Chalmers riffing on his rap influences. Where is Penny Wong this week? Oh, the Quad is on. No, actually it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off. Biden can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play paterfamilias in a contested region, even if his friends need him. He has to deal with homegrown lunatics who want to burn the republic. When we speak this week about what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s learned during the transition to being prime minister, Albanese says the step change has reinforced the importance of planning ahead; understanding there are things requiring immediate attention \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whilst keeping focus on the medium and long term\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Kevin Rudd was whacked by the global financial crisis in 2007. Albanese has battled his own external shocks: an energy supply crisis and global inflation. The problems were large enough in scale and scope to have derailed Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre-election program. But the Labor ensemble pinned its ears back and pushed through their to-do lists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s achievements has been to keep focused on the things we said we would do,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Albanese says. Albanese has less time in government to strategise than he had in opposition, which increases the risk of miscalculations. But he says the flip side of his diminished bandwidth is access to high-level advice. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also drawing on muscle memory, knowledge accumulated by watching opponents across the dispatch box in the years Labor was in the wilderness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had nine years to think about what went right and what could be done better, as well as watch the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments and think about what I would be doing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Albanese looks more comfortable in the job than many people might have expected. From a leader considered small target and municipal pre-election, the prime minister has racked up modest status credits in the global zeitgeist. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the progressive empath designate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a vacancy that opened up when Jacinda Ardern\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political star fell to earth. On Instagram Albanese smiles, laughs and hugs almost as much as the Princess of Wales. Albanese has been anointed the southern hemisphere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice of hope and opportunity by the faction\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elder statesman, Justin Trudeau, in Time magazine. Not brandishing a lump of coal in parliament, or working with Saudi Arabia to crash coordinated action to curb global heating, secures an Australian politician a provisional entry card to rooms where it happens, and Albanese sees the transition to the low-emissions economy as the contemporary Labor project, the economic reform of the epoch. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think this is a critical period,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Albanese says, reaching for the homily. Delivering that transition \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is one of the reasons we need a Labor government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is no sign of a shift from the Coalition on any of these issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The polls for now are good, because Albanese and the ensemble feel like a decisive break from the performative vacuousness of Scott Morrison. Albanese remains the political beneficiary of NBM (not being Morrison) but Labor strategists suspect the NBM cycle is just about maxed out. Voters aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet surly, but they will move shortly to judging the government on its merits. Bored by an orderly change of government rendered daily on page three, the ravenous political news cycle is also, increasingly, craving page one spectacle. That dopamine hit of dysfunction. The return of fight season Winter is coming, and the arena is getting more noisy. Paul Keating won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let up on the strategic idiocy of Aukus. Albanese faces querulous near-daily demands from the national papers to keep his hands off the stage three tax cuts. The Oliver Twists of media and thinktank progressivism (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please sir, I want some more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) meanwhile flay Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of zeal in the face of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serious challenges. Adjacent to this intergenerational Labor legacy war, down with redistribution from the Australian and the Financial Review, and escalating progressive ennui, sits garden variety partisanship. Twelve months into his opposition leadership, Peter Dutton looks like a politician who has resolved to be Peter Dutton. Nothing more. Nothing less. Albanese and Dutton get on reasonably well. The two engage in more regular private conversation than voters might realise. But Albanese doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a lot of opportunity for joint ventures with his opponent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think there are no signs that [Peter] is up for being constructive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Albanese says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think, policy-wise, the big opportunity for him was to show bipartisanship on constitutional recognition. I genuinely tried [but] \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I think he is a negative politician \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it is what it is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t subtle. He wants to thwart Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to dial down the drama. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the hunt for the knockout blow. The Liberal leader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first foray was Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s climate policy driving up the cost of everything. That didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch. His latest moral panic is Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged surge of migrants will drive up the cost of housing. Given the lived reality of ludicrously expensive houses, not enough supply, rising interest rates and high living costs, this sortie could prove more salient. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s listlessness about Dutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pugilism \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least from my current distance. Dutton possesses Tony Abbott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negativity but seems to lack Abbott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pulverising zeal, his appetite for hyper-partisan helter-skelter. Dutton punching down loyally, coddling the base on 2GB strictly during office hours, feels not only obvious and rote, it feels strangely low-energy. Given the moderate wing is now decimated, given Dutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s considerable authority over his party room, refusing to experiment or grow in the job feels like a crisis of confidence. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s curious. Perhaps he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find another gear, but right now the relentless retro opportunism makes Dutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Liberal party feel like an Abbott tribute band grinding out covers on the country wedding circuit. While Dutton says no to everything, and crashes into things in the hope of breaking them, clamour is also building on the left. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, expended considerable internal authority to ensure his party helped bolster then legislate Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first tranche of climate policies rather than torpedo them. But that early collaboration has lapsed into rancour over housing policy. The Greens gained lower house territory last May in part by appealing to the grievances of the growing cohort of renters locked out of home ownership. The Greens know Labor wants the renters in their column come election time, but won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match them for boldness when it comes to policy prescriptions improving affordability, not when Albanese needs to neutralise asset holders and the investors as well as court aspirants in the housing market. Demographically, generationally, housing affordability feels like the perfect political fight for the Greens to pick, so Albanese enters his second year in the top job battling two oppositions. He posits the Greens party room is divided between people \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who want to see the government do things, and people who want to block the government doing things\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. If his punditry is right, if the Greens are locked in an internal battle between the activists and materialists, who wins? Albanese opts for truth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. First character, then stability If tranquillity is too much to hope for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it very likely is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Albanese will fashion his re-election pitch around stability. The required lore for this pivot is being assembled as we approach the first year anniversary; a version of clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, stick with Labor. Albanese lobs a mind-focusing point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last seven elections have elected seven prime ministers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prime minister says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The next election will be an opportunity to re-elect a prime minister. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have happened for more than 20 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I feel this fun fact must be wrong, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right. A prime minister hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been re-elected in Australia since John Howard made the 2004 election about trust in order to pulverise Mark Latham. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve battled rolling regicide for two decades. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last seven elections have produced Howard, Rudd, Gillard, Abbott, Turnbull, Morrison, Albanese,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prime minister says. He says federal elections here are already too frequent. Other comparable nations have four and five-year terms while we reach for the democracy sausage every three years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest to have instability.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Albanese says his foundational task in this opening year was to reveal the character of the government. Labor had to be worthy of the office. Courtship was necessary because a transition was necessary between Morrison losing and Labor winning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the last election it was clear there was considerable opposition to the Morrison government and, after nine years, part of that was what was the point of that government? From opposition, [the voters] weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t certain about us and part of what our task has been and will continue to be as a first-term government is to restore faith and have a very clear narrative of the values Labor has and the policies that reflect those values.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Albanese says part of demonstrating that Labor has the disposition to deliver stability is him helming an open-access government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We talk to business, talk to unions, talk to civil society, talk to women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s groups. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that everyone gets the answer that they want, but it does mean it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a narrow government that serves a sectional interest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I wonder if he thinks election night last May was the high-water mark of the new politics; whether voter appetite for disruption and disruptors has waned without the foil of Morrison to galvanise progressives on the centre right and centre left? Is the current environment more favourable to majority governments? Albanese considers waning partisan loyalty a long-term trend reflected across western democracies. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a flash in the pan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You just had an election in Finland where the social democrats got 19% and they were defeated by a party that got 21%.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Albanese in his moments of audacious dreaming thinks it is possible to prosper if the Labor project finds its moment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible to lift Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary vote up? Yes, I certainly do, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my objective to do so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/18/tom-kim-mud-bath-video-pga-championship-golf", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Tom Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accidental mud bath at US PGA Championship goes viral", "lead": "During a remarkable episode in the latter stages of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play, the South Korean golfer Tom Kim emerged caked in mud after trying to find his ball", "author": "Ewan Murray at Oak Hill", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T03:04:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036198", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/98e947b4f10916b3ad55a3a27883ce53a00c325a/0_275_5421_3253/500.jpg", "body": "The abiding image of the 105th US PGA Championship may not involve the victor.

The latest figures represent a remarkable turnaround for the organisation which was reported to be on the brink of financial ruin 12 months ago with $11m of debt and losses. Having posted a $4.4m loss in 2021, the organisation recovered to have revenue exceed expenses by $300,000 in 2022. A debt of $4.2m remains, however, with the debt facility extended from May and September 2023 to August 2025. Clearing that debt will be a priority for the organisation in 2023. Netball Australia, which announced the results at its AGM on Thursday night, said the more stable position had been reached due to good cost management and growth in commercial revenues, including a new broadcast partner in the Foxtel Group. A major sponsorship deal with Visit Victoria also played its part in the recovery, after the tourism branch of the Victorian government stepped in to plug a $15m hole left when Hancock Prospecting pulled out of a deal in controversial circumstances in October. Commercial and broadcast sponsorship contributed 49% of total revenue in 2022, a dramatic increase on 2021. The previous year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disastrous financial results were in a large part down to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, but with crowds back in stadiums, income from events surpassed the $3m mark in the latest figures. Netball Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Kelly Ryan, said the results show the sport is heading in the right direction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Being above budget in 2022 is a great turnaround and shows Netball Australia has been fiscally responsible and is able to grow its revenues,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ryan said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know there is still more work that needs to be done and we are focused on strengthening our balance sheet so that we can continue to invest in the development of the sport at the grassroots through to the elite level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Participation is also up in the sport. Ausplay, which is led by the Australian Sports Commission, reported this week that participation surpassed one million in 2022, making it the third most popular team participation sport in Australia behind football and basketball, and ahead of AFL football.

We are all humans worthy of love and care. Society began using imprisonment on an industrial scale as a form of punishment, ironically as an act of kindness. We started locking people away as a gesture of mercy. It was seen as less barbaric than corporal punishment or public whippings or beatings. There is no world in which I am campaigning for physical violence, but it is wrong to pretend that locking people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c away in cages is vastly kinder than beating them in public. At some point society decided it was not only OK, but beneficial, to lock up children as young as 10 behind bars. I have spent a long time trying to imagine that moment. Imagine closing and opening your eyes and thinking: OK this is it. This is the way we will restore harmony on our streets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we will put children in cages and adults behind bars. When I lived and worked in Alice Springs I represented many grandmothers of children who had been snatched from the streets by grown men and thrown into police cars and concrete cells. I watched smart, funny, naughty children transform into desperately unhappy, terrified teenagers. I would go to bed at the end of the day full of fear that I would have one less child in my care the following morning. There doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be beatings and torture for caging children to be profoundly harmful (although this can, and does, happen too). Taking children away from their families, removing them from their sense of self and belonging, are just some ways in which children are frequently and repeatedly hurt by the state. I will never forget the beautiful children or their courageous grandmothers who I grew to know and love when I lived in central Australia. There are some terrible tales that will stay with me for the rest of my life, precisely because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage to break those children free. I remember one teenage boy who I watched unravel as his whole world and sense of self came apart. I have never been so terrified for another human being. He went from a kind, funny humble young man to someone who clung on to my shirt and spoke in gibberish, and yet we consider this barbarity somehow more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153civilised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than corporal punishment. It is unconscionable to tear children from their families and lock them away in cages. No one deserves that. Change the Record, the Human Rights Law Centre, doctors, teachers, parents and grandparents and so many concerned citizens have been working tirelessly, calling on all state and territory governments to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153raise the age\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to at least 14 years old, to keep these very young children out of prison. No one is suggesting a 14-year-old belongs behind bars. However, if we are going to draw an arbitrary line in the sand under which children can never ever be locked away, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s choose a line backed by the relatively conservative Australian Medical Association and the Law Council of Australia and build from there. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s urge state and territory governments to not only change the laws to something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backed by industry expertise, but also by our regional polling. The ACT government has announced that it will legislate to prevent children under 14 being arrested and thrown behind bars. Victoria too has promised it will raise the age (but only to prevent the detention of children under the age of 12 years old). Not caging children under 14 years old is not revolutionary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is the bare minimum we can do to not torture kids who are in our care. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Sophie Trevitt is winner of Liberty Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Voltaire Human Rights Award for 2023 and former national director of Change the Record"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/19/how-is-australia-trying-to-sell-a-major-gas-expansion-by-badging-it-sustainable", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "How is Australia trying to sell a major gas expansion?

Now, though, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to recognise Middle Arm as the same project. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Developing marine infrastructure at Middle Arm will open new export opportunities in Northern Australia for commodities such as green hydrogen and critical minerals, with associated downstream opportunities for onshore processing and low-emission manufacturing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the federal minister for resources, Madeline King, told an NT Resources Week conference in August. A few weeks later the Albanese government confirmed its support for the project. The $1.5bn in equity from the federal government is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153providing a pathway to a decarbonised economy by helping emerging clean energy industries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the minister for infrastructure, Catherine King, said in a budget release. The ABC reported that staff in the NT Department of Chief Minister and Cabinet were tasked with removing the references to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153petrochemicals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from more than a dozen government websites discussing Middle Arm. This is despite the fact the government continues to seek approval from the NT Environment Protection Authority for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low-emission petrochemicals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be among the mix of industries at Middle Arm. Perhaps Middle Arm can be delivered as a sustainable industrial precinct that is powered by renewables. But that would involve a major rethink. The current plan is based on a massive expansion of the gas industry and relies on a yet-to-be-designed CCS plant located beyond Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jurisdiction to control a huge increase in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emissions. Before the Albanese government invests $1.5bn of taxpayer money in maritime infrastructure, it needs to look beyond the spin, level with the Australian public about what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed and assess \u00e2\u20ac\u201c using hard science \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether it jeopardises Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/19/death-of-masterchef-judge-jock-zonfrillo-sparks-frenzy-of-tabloid-intrusion", "primaryCategory": "media", "title": "Death of MasterChef judge Jock Zonfrillo sparks frenzy of tabloid intrusion | Weekly Beast", "lead": "Relentless speculation and paparazzo at funeral as family and colleagues mourn.

Less than an hour after his family broke the news of his death in a Melbourne hotel room, the Daily Mail headline was: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How did Jock Zonfrillo die? MasterChef star\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cause of death revealed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Spoiler alert: the cause of death was not revealed. An inquest is pending, but that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop a guessing game among the tabloids and the shock jocks. As Media Watch host Paul Barry said earlier this month: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the facts about someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t inflict more pain on the grieving family with a grubby guessing game on how they died.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On Wednesday, just five days after Zonfrillo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funeral, the Daily Mail claimed MasterChef producers had begun the casting process to replace him. Ten told Weekly Beast the claim is not true. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Network Ten is poised to begin the search for Jock Zonfrillo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement on MasterChef Australia, with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcevery well-known chef\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 a contender,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Daily Mail reported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the network insist casting has not yet begun, insiders on the hit show say conversations have already started after the beloved judge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tragic death in the early hours of May 1, one day before the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2023 premiere.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Ten spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Casting for the next season of MasterChef Australia has not commenced. To suggest otherwise is completely false and misleading. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focused on the current season of MasterChef Australia that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on air now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Daily Mail Australia says it stands by the story. But the worst intrusion came last Friday, the day of Zonfrillo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private funeral, when the Daily Telegraph published multiple photographs online of the event without permission hours after the service. Taken by a freelance paparazzo stationed outside the northern Sydney funeral home, the pictures of the coffin and the grieving family and friends were published hours later. The pictures were published across News Corp mastheads over the following days. Ten confirmed the family wanted the funeral to be private and the media was not invited, apart from a Ten crew which filmed mourners arriving with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blessing of the family\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the evening news. Sources said the News Corp paparazzo was asked by security to stand behind a cordon and continued to shoot through the open door of the chapel during the service. News Corp did not respond to a request for comment. Snap unhappy It would seem no one in the news is safe from being photographed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not even in their own homes. The Australian published a photograph of ACT chief prosecutor Shane Drumgold having a beer in his Canberra driveway on the front page of the paper on Friday. The reporter camped outside Drumgold\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s residence took the photo himself. Drumgold is on leave as an inquiry into the handling of a case against the former Liberal staff member Bruce Lehrmann continues. An ACT government spokesperson said Drumgold had asked to take leave. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With a beer in his hand but deep in contemplation, ACT chief prosecutor Shane Drumgold spent much of Thursday perched in the sun in the driveway of his Canberra home, aware that his gruelling ordeal on the witness stand of the Sofronoff inquiry is far from over,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the national broadsheet reported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The 58-year-old refused on Thursday to comment on his sudden absence but appeared to be in deep thought when spotted, casually dressed in a hoodie and tracksuit pants, outside his Canberra home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Without a comment from Drumgold himself, the paper which once called itself \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the heart of the nation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, was reduced to describing what the subject was wearing Daily Mail-style. What climate crisis? Environment reporters and climate scientists were extremely disappointed by the announcement of changes to the Walkley awards this week which did not include a separate category for the reporting of climate change and the environment. A new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153specialist and beat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd category was created but the Walkleys judging board resisted a push for a separate climate and/or environment award, topics which most people agree are the biggest issues facing humanity. The Walkleys held roundtable discussions with reporters on the beat, and as recently as March was seriously considering introducing separate climate change and/or the environment categories but the talks went nowhere. The manager of policy and strategy for the Wilderness Society, Tim Beshara, accused the Walkleys of ignoring environmental and climate issues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This reflects very poorly on the Australian media industry in how, when acting as a collective, they are either unable or unwilling to give due attention to the most substantive issues of our time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Beshara told Weekly Beast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Walkleys, as a proxy for the whole media industry, saying that these issues matter to us, but climate and environment don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. They can go in the miscellaneous or none-of-the-above award category, where we think they belong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDole bludger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 scare There is nothing like a modest increase of $20 a week in welfare payments to set the hares running about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dole bludgers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And if the media can personalise the issue by finding a scapegoat, they will. Since the budget was handed down, several welfare recipients have been pursued by sections of the media for daring to stick their hands up and talk about the inadequacy of income support. One couple in Queensland, who spoke to the ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 7.30 program last week, became the subject of multiple articles in the Daily Mail which dissected their budget and mocked their predicament. Nine Radio host Ray Hadley questioned why taxpayers should have to fund people who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seemingly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Daily Mail reported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He said he found it \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcoffensive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the Sunshine Coast couple were complaining about spending $350-a-week on groceries, a sum of money families with even more children wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even spend. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hadley also revealed that he had found over 230 roles available on the Sunshine Coast for cooks and chefs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the energy to work 60 hours a week, so instead, we pay for it. We pay for your laziness,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hadley said.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the Mail went even further the next day, sending a paparazzo to follow the family and document their day, criticising the man for sitting in a cafe. Weekly Beast understands the couple is distressed by being followed by a photographer and is now being supported by the Australian Council of Social Service, which had put them forward as media case studies. In Sydney, Nine radio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ben Fordham has used one welfare recipient as fodder for his morning show all week, giving his listeners live updates on his performative attempt to get the man a job and claiming that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there are jobs everywhere\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for anyone who wants to work. Mauled by a toothless tiger A ruling by the media watchdog this week is a prime example of why the body is seen as a toothless tiger. The Australian Communications and Media Authority spent a year investigating Nine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s A Current Affair after a man complained his privacy was breached when the program included his name, part of his residential address and video footage of his face in a neighbourhood dispute story. Acma agreed the man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privacy had been invaded because under the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, broadcasters must not air personal information without consent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unless it is in the public interest. The consequence for Nine? Staff will be trained in privacy requirements of the code. And what of the A Current Affair story which the man complained of? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still live online and has racked up 9m views. Acma told us it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the power to order a broadcaster to take down an online copy of the program."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/may/18/pga-championship-2023-golf-oak-hill-first-round-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "US PGA Championship 2023: first round \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "<strong>Hole-by-hole report:</strong> Eric Cole is the surprise overnight leader at the end of a day delayed by frost.

A fine 68 yet he trudges off in a hot funk. Tony Finau meanwhile tidies up for a par. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back in 31 having gone out in 41! A two-over 72 that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feel like a complete triumph. Wonderful scenes in the media tent, where Tom Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face crumbles into hysterical laughter as he checks his phone and watches footage of the mud-related mishap that befell him on 6. This young man is a star. A hell of a golfer as well, of course, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just got that special something. You have to love him. Less happy, however, is Adam Scott, who takes two to get out of a greenside bunker at 18, and stares a double straight in the face. What a way to end an otherwise fine round. The hooter goes. Players can finish the hole they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on. Par for the leader Eric Cole on the par-three 5th. He remains at -5. Back on 9, Tom Kim makes par and signs for a very muddy 73. Adam Scott batters his drive down 18. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be happy to find the fairway; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be even happier that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done so before the hooter goes for bad light. Now, having started the hole, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have the option to finish it if he wants. Which he surely will, to ensure a couple of extra hours in bed. Eric Cole birdies the par-five 4th. No surprise there, given it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the easiest hole on the course today. But it is a surprise that the 34-year-old championship debutant is now leading the PGA! A miserable end to the round for Thomas Pieters, though, who yips a short par putt on 9 that forces him to settle for a one-under 69. -5: Cole (13*) -4: DeChambeau (F), Scott (16), D Johnson (15) Tom Kim, his trousers caked in mud and rolled up to his knees, nearly birdies 7. He remains at +3. Holes 6 and 7 are called Double Trouble and Creek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Elbow, by the way. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way too late for zingers, so thank goodness they write themselves. Tom Kim appears to be going all out for his social-media bonus. He goes after his ball in deep reeds down the side of 6, only to take an accidental tumble into thick mud by Allens Creek. He covers himself in it, trousers and shoes soaked through, filth all over the front of his shirt. Then he takes a second, deliberate dip in the creek to clean himself up as much as he can! Like a silent-movie version of Jean van de Velde. A smile on his face all the time \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and he limits the damage to bogey! That is absurd, and a meme waiting to happen. You have to love Tom Kim. A fine up and down from the back of 14 by Dustin Johnson. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s salvaged a par after a dreadful tee shot. He remains at -4, alongside new co-leader Eric Cole, who birdies 3. But never mind any of that, because \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Tony Finau can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be stopped! He swishes his tee shot at the par-three 15th pin high, then rakes in a 30-footer for his third birdie in a row, and his fourth in five holes! He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back to +2 and right in the mix again! This is astonishing. His playing partner Adam Scott satisfies himself with a two-putt par to remain at -4. And back on 14, someone else is on the comeback trail: Xander Schauffele, who played the first three holes in four over par, but has since birdied 7, 12 and now 14 to get himself back to +1. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very strange game, golf. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so addictive. Eric Cole rises to -3 with birdie at 2. Justin Rose bogeys 11 to slip to -1. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trouble for Dustin Johnson on 14: he hooks a 3-wood (for safety!) into the trees down the left, then sends his second over the back. A big up and down coming up. Another birdie for Tony Finau! He matches his playing partner Adam Scott shot for shot on 14: a drive into the bunker, a splash out close, a tidy putt. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back to +3, and this is turning into a fine comeback. Meanwhile bogey for Thomas Pieters at 7, and he slips back to -2. -4: DeChambeau (F), Scott (14), D Johnson (13) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F) Michael Block, one of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPGA Team of 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 club professionals in the field this week, signs for a level-par 70. What a performance from the 46-year-old from California, who came back in 34 strokes after birdies at 12, 13 and 16. A third birdie in four holes for Dustin Johnson, this time at the par-five 13th, and he joins Bryson DeChambeau in the lead. Up ahead, Adam Scott drives into the bunker at the front of the risk-and-reward 14th, then splashes aggressively from 85 feet to kick-in distance. If the genial Aussie isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t joining the leaders in a couple of minutes, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to go away and have a long think about what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done. What a sand shot! -4: DeChambeau (F), D Johnson (13) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F), Pieters (15*), Scott (13) A walk and talk with Tony Finau. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only good thing about not scoring early is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of golf in front of me \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to rattle off a couple of birdies to get some mojo going \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just gonna throw my sweater back on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame Finau, who is in the middle of a shift with other things to think about \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but not entirely sure how long this innovation is going to last. Tony Finau continues to nudge his way back up the leaderboard. A second birdie in three holes, this time at the par-five 13th, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +4, despite it all. Birdie meanwhile for Thomas Pieters, who bundles his second into the heart of 6, using the camber of the green to gather his ball to 12 feet. In goes the putt, and he joins the group at -3. Dustin Johnson is on the charge! He drains a 30-footer up 12, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his third birdie in six holes. No bogeys on his card either. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -3. Meanwhile Tom Kim nearly holes out from 100 yards at 4; the hipsters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 long shot gets back to +2. -4: DeChambeau (F) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F), Scott (12), D Johnson (12) Justin Rose continues to scrap. He sends a forensic iron straight at the flag on 9, and tickles the downhill ten-footer that remains in for birdie. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out in 33 and back at -2. Ewan Murray is at Oak Hill. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his first day report. An extremely needless three-putt bogey for Sepp Straka on 5. A 30-foot birdie putt left four feet short, then the par saver shoved right of the cup. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back to -2. Meanwhile a double bogey on 10 for one of the pre-tournament favourites, Patrick Cantlay, the result of finding Allens Creek down the right. Having already made bogey at 8, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +3. A poor chip from Justin Rose at 8, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handing one of those shots straight back. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -1, with only two pars on his card so far. Tony Finau turned in 41 strokes. He repairs a small amount of the damage by draining a monster up 11 for birdie. However he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still +5. Meanwhile a birdie for Sepp Straka at the par-five 4th, and the Austrian returns to -3. Birdie for Justin Rose at 7, which means he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s repaired the double-bogey damage in just two holes. And another birdie for Dustin Johnson, who won on the LIV tour last week and is going along nicely here too. This one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s courtesy of a carefree ten-footer at 10, and he rises to -2. -4: DeChambeau (F) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F), Straka (13*), Scott (11) -2: Fox (F), Hovland (F), Bradley (F), Buckley (15), Pieters (12*), D Johnson (10), Rose (7), Cole (7*) Birdies for championship debutant Hayden Buckley at 12 and 14, and the 27-year-old from Chattanooga choo-choos all the way to -2. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry. Speaking of which \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Morning frost might make for a long night for you,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd begins Dan Hamilton, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a golfer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best friend at this time of year in upstate New York and over the border in Ontario and Quebec.

He sends a 30-foot tramliner into the cup at 3 for his second bounce-back birdie in three holes. Once again he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -2, but for how much longer, one way or another? If recent behaviour is anything to go by, not very much. Bounce-back birdie for Adam Scott! After another booming drive / gentle wedge combo, he picks up a stroke at 10 to return to -3. Also moving up the leaderboard: Eric Cole, who nearly won the Honda Classic back in February, and is playing in the PGA Championship for the first time. The 34-year-old late bloomer cards back-to-back birdies at 14 and 15 to rise to -2. Cole\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the last match starting from 10 this evening. There is no way this round will be completed tonight. South Korea already has a PGA champion: YE Yang, who became the first man to overhaul Tiger Woods on the Sunday at a major while winning in 2009. Yang is here this year, but having played the back nine in 34 strokes, has just bogeyed 1, doubled 2, and bogeyed 3 to drop to +3 in double-quick time. Some of his younger compatriots, hotly tipped this year, are also struggling. Tom Kim is +3 after 10*, Im Sung-jae is +4 through 9*, and KH Lee shot 73 earlier on. Kim Si-woo is hanging on in there a little better, though: the 2017 Players champion is +1 having played the back nine in 36. Consistency is coming at a premium for Thomas Pieters right now. Having bounced back from bogey at 18 with birdie at 1, he now drops another shot at 2 and drops to -1. Justin Rose missed the hole completely from a couple of feet at 5. So he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done really well to bounce back from that utterly unnecessary double bogey with birdie at 6. He waltzes off the green with a great big smile on his face. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be playing with too much regret or inhibition. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -1. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a couple of hours of action to go at least. Adam Scott pays the penalty for a wild drive at 9. Always chasing position, he ends up with bogey and slips back to -2. Along with Sepp Straka (11*) and Thomas Pieters (10*), he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the lowest scorer of the second wave of starters right now. The sun will set in Rochester at 8.30pm local time today. Pretty sure the first round won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be completed this evening. Goddamn morning frost! Bounce-back birdie for Thomas Pieters at 1. He returns to -2. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of just 17 players under par right now. There are 121 over it. Rory McIlroy speaks to Sky. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Pretty erratic \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 pretty nasty \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have my best stuff \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I actually felt I did really well to shoot one over in the end \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I played OK on the way in but will have to play a lot better than that if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m to have a chance \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a little under the weather but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m OK \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too warm out there \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 nothing that a lot of vitamin C and a lot of rest will manage it \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 hopefully I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a little better tomorrow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dustin Johnson makes his first move of the day. He drains a 30-footer across 7 and rises to -1. Meanwhile up on 8, Adam Scott sends another 365-yard bomb down the track, wedges close, and is suddenly just one off the lead at -3! But a double bogey for Justin Rose on 5, the punishment for finding the deep bunker to the left of the green, then yipping a short bogey putt. Hartley Wintney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finest drops back to -1. -4: DeChambeau (F) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F), Scott (8) Bogey for Thomas Pieters at 18. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still played the back nine in 34 strokes, though, and remains both in red figures and the top ten. Tony Finau hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to arrest that awful start. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now followed up that aforementioned double bogey at 5 with further dropped shots at 6 and 7. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five shots gone in four holes, and at +5 needs something to happen quickly. Already. Sending his tee shot at 8 into thick oomska down the left won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help much. Putt of the day made by Pablo Larrazabal on 17. A huge 45-foot left-to-right swinger that always looks like dropping. A thing of beauty. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his first birdie of the day after a run of seven pars. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -1. Bogey for Sepp Straka on 18. He leaves his second stuck on the side of a rough-strewn bank, short-sided, and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get close with his delicate chip up. His first backward step of the day, and he slips down to -2. Another birdie for Justin Rose! He whistles his tee shot at the par-three 3rd to ten feet, and makes no mistake with the putt. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -2. He could \u00e2\u20ac\u201c should \u00e2\u20ac\u201c soon be joined there by Adam Scott, who takes advantage of the wind blowing down 6 to send his drive 365 yards. He wedges his second from 130 yards to four feet, and yes, in it goes. A few of the afternoon starters are beginning to make their move. -4: DeChambeau (F) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F), Straka (8*) -2: Fox (F), Hovland (F), Bradley (F), Pieters (8*), Scott (6), Rose (3) Brooks versus Patrick Cantlay would be the most entertaining LIV v PGA pairing in the last group on Sunday, by any available comedic metric, or sliding scale of amusement. Of course it would, given the two-speed narrative of the Masters. Fingers crossed, though Koepka shot 72 earlier today, while Cantlay is just (just!) level par through four holes. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long way to go. The Masters ended up as a PGA v LIV battle between Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka. Any chance of a similar dynamic this week? Of course there is, with Bryson DeChambeau and Scottie Scheffler currently leading the way. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some LIV backup coming over the hill, too, with new recruit Thomas Pieters making birdies at 13 and 16 to move to -2, just two behind. Whatever your view on the tour brouhaha, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t added a little extra spice. Tony Finau was another player hotly tipped to make his major breakthrough this week. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already in a spot of bother. Bogey at 4, followed by double at the par-three 5th, the result of sending his tee shot into thick rough to the left of the green, then failing to dig it out. A second attempt doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go close, and two putts later he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +3. Tyrrell Hatton has been in hot form recently. He might be in a hot mood right now, however, having opened with a bogey followed by a double at 2. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +3 in the blink of an eye. But a fast start for his compatriot Justin Rose, who pours in a 15-footer at 1 to move into red figures immediately. A long birdie effort nearly drops at 2, as well, but -1 is where he remains, and a most acceptable start by the 2013 US Open winner. Sepp Straka became the first Austrian to win on the PGA Tour last year, pipping Shane Lowry to the Honda Classic. The 30-year-old\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record in the majors is dismal, though, with a tie for 28th at the 2019 US Open his best return. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s started strongly here this afternoon. Birdies at 10 and 12, then a booming 367-yard drive down 16, followed by a wedge to three feet, and all of a sudden he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the one hot property of the later starters out there on the course right now. -4: DeChambeau (F) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F), Straka (7*) -2: Fox (F), Hovland (F), Bradley (F) It was a poor day for the reigning US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick. A 76 and while he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not down among the dead men \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nobody will be writing off Jon Rahm, also +6, quite yet, for example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll really have to go some to recover. Just a steady shedding of shots, and no birdies. The third member of that DeChambeau-Bradley group is coming off a fantastic week. Jason Day won the Byron Nelson last Sunday, his first Tour win in over five years. But an emotional victory, on Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day in the wake of losing his own, seems to have taken a toll. A six-over round of 76, and the 35-year-old Aussie won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be adding to his 2016 title this year. Bryson finds the centre of the 9th in two fuss-free strokes. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a 25-footer uphill for birdie, but seriously underhits it, leaving an unnecessary three-foot knee-knocker. But in it pops, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading the PGA Championship right now. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brilliant round of 66. His playing partner Keegan Bradley meanwhile finishes with a bogey, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be happy enough with his 68. -4: DeChambeau (F) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F) -2: Fox (F), Hovland (F), Straka (6*) Adam Scott is in good form at the moment. He demonstrates that by arrowing his tee shot at the long par-three 3rd to six feet. In goes the putt, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only the eighth birdie of the day on this difficult hole. The 2013 Masters champion is -1. A terrible start to the round by Xander Schauffele. Bogey at 1, followed by a complete mess at the par-four 2nd: a chip bladed through the green and down a swale, two efforts to get back up, and a putt for double bogey. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +3 in short order. Mickelson powers his second at the 1st into the heart of the green. No mean feat from the deep rough. Two putts later and the nearly-53-year-old walks off with his par. Also happy with par: Bryson DeChambeau on 8, after lagging a 72-foot putt to kick-in distance. He stays one clear at the top at -4. Callum Tarren gets up and down from 70 yards on 18. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only for bogey, but it limits the damage, especially after dropping a shot on the previous hole, and the 32-year-old from Darlington ends with a very creditable 71. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +1. A disappointing finish to his round, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feel a whole lot better having given a potential double the bodyswerve. Here comes Lefty! Phil Mickelson is back at the PGA, in which he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teeing it up for the 30th time. His opening drive is a big slice into bother down the left. One way or another, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a man who will die wondering. Back on 7, a break for Keegan Bradley, whose second nestles between two bunkers. His chip is overly aggressive and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunate again when he clatters the flagstick. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left with a six-footer for par instead of a chip \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the putt. A bogey drops him back to -3. DeChambeau meanwhile is snookered by the bunker, rather than in it, but he loops over the flag to eight feet before making the par saver. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one hell of an up and down. The 2020 US Open champion now leads on his own. -4: DeChambeau (16*) -3: Scheffler (F), Conenrs (F), Bradley (16*) Cam Smith closes with a bogey. The Open champion ends the day having taken 72 lashes. Meanwhile I probably shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have mentioned the Bradley-DeChambeau inspiration thing, because now, DeChambeau having found sand down one side of 7, Bradley does the same down the other. Apologies to both for rattling the golfing gods. Keegan Bradley and Bryson DeChambeau are going round together, and giving each other plenty of inspiration. DeChambeau sticks an approach dead at 6 for a kick-in birdie; Bradley matches his score and the pair leap into a share of the lead. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trouble afoot for Bryson on 7 as he sends his second into a deep bunker front right. Not a lot of green to work with from there. -4: Bradley (15*), DeChambeau (15*) -3: Scheffler (F), Conners (F) The last two holes of Jordan Spieth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s round: birdie at 8, bogey at 9. His form in microcosm, and he signs for a 73. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +3. Par for his playing partner Victor Hovland, who is sat nicely at -2 after his 68. Completing the group, Shane Lowry, who bogeys for a 73. The 2019 Open champion never really recovered his equilibrium after thinning a bunker shot through the short par-four 14th, then nearly sending his following shot back into the same trap. Plenty of curse words after that, let me tell you. Kazuki Higa flew out of the blocks this morning. A birdie putt lipped out at 10, but then he made four of them on consecutive holes between 11 and 14. Since reaching the heady heights of -4, however, it was all downhill again: a bogey at 17, then a nightmare end to his round: double at 6, then bogeys at 7, 8 and 9. The world number 99 would have almost certainly taken a 72 at the start of play, but he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel so good signing his name to one now. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +2. Birdie for Jon Rahm at 8. Only problem for the Masters champion being, the previous two holes saw him make bogey and double bogey. Throw in the way his game unravelled around the turn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bogeys at 16, 17, 18, 2 and 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the world number one is +6. The grand slam, the longest of long shots at the best of times, looks a proper pipe dream already. It was a disappointing end to Brooks Koepka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s round. The 2018 and 2019 champion sent his approach at 9 into a bunker, and he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make the sandy save. He ended up signing for a two-over 72. A par up 9 for Rory McIlroy, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feel pretty good about his 71 given where he was on 2, standing at the bottom of a swale staring bogey or worse in the face. One outrageous 37-foot putt up the hill later, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d saved his par, since when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s picked up a couple of shots. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +1, a shot better off than his playing partner, the defending champion Justin Thomas, who follows up his double at 6 with a closing bogey. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +2. The third member of the match, Collin Morikawa, ends up with a 71 as well, unable to salvage par from an awkward position nestled up against the collar of the green. Just the one shot between them all, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s McIlroy who finished the day with the wind at his back. A quiet par-par end to Corey Conners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 round. The Canadian signs for a 67 and a current share of the early clubhouse lead. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -3. Meanwhile Jordan Spieth finally moves in the right direction again, steering in a gentle right-to-left slider from 12 feet on 8 for his first birdie since his fourth hole of the day. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +2 again and high-fives his caddy Michael Greller accordingly. Frustration for Sahith Theegala on 18. A short par putt lips out, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finished a previously promising round with three straight bogeys. He ends up signing for a one-over 71, having once been three under for his round. A birdie for the newly svelte Bryson DeChambeau at the par-five 4th. He joins the leaders at -3, though Scottie Scheffler briefly threatens to pull ahead again, but his 15-foot birdie effort on 9 lips out. He nearly drops his putter onto the top of his head during a contortion of frustration, but settles down quickly enough and signs for a brilliant 67. His first bogey-free round in a major. Rory McIlroy grabs back that shot he dropped at 5. He darts his approach at 8 from 134 yards to six feet. He knocks the birdie putt into the centre of the cup and moves back to +1. Given the state his game, and perhaps his noggin, was in when he stood at the bottom of that swale behind 2, putter in hand, a round of 71 would be one hell of an achievement and something to build on for the rest of the week. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one par away from a huge confidence boost. Thanks Luke. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a decent round of 68 by Ryan Fox. Just the ten players under par, and two of those have only just started their rounds. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been testing all right. -3: Scheffler (17*), Conners (17), Bradley (12*) -2: Fox (F), Hovland (15*), DeChambeau (12*) -1: Tarren (15), Suh (13), Kaewkanjana (2*), Buckley (2) Well, Rory McIlroy is neither at the top of the leaderboard nor at the bottom, but he is two over par after 15 holes and tied 28th. Not exactly flying \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Conners, Scheffler and Bradley are the co-leaders at three under. Now, Scott Murray is back and ready to take you through the rest of this first round. Over to you Scott. Rahm drops another shot and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five over. Not good. Scheffler, who is getting his work done unfussily and impressively, rolls in a birdie putt at the eighth to nab a share of the lead on three under. The commentator tells us he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never had a bogey-free round during his career at the majors \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just one hole away from achieving the feat. Rory McIlroy rolls in for a par and is two over. Jon Rahm is having a poor day so far and is four over through 12 holes. In other news, Keegan Bradley has birdied three out of four holes to earn a share of the lead on three under \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 including this belter: Hovland misses a long par putt at the sixth, directing it quite a bit to the right, and he (like Conners) will drop a shot. So Conners will be the outright leader on three under. Conners misses that putt and drops back to three under. So Conners and Hovland are the co-leaders at three under. Hovland, meanwhile, hits a miraculous third shot after (I think) having to drop somewhere difficult after going in the water. At the 15th, our outright leader Conners has a tricky chip from behind the same bunker that Theegala just chipped out of \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 he hits a decent enough shot but leaves it about 10 or 12 feet short. Hovland, meanwhile, I think has put his tee shot in the drink from the sixth tee. Scottie Scheffler, wearing the maillot jaune, hits a good curling putt at the seventh, his 15th hole of the day. But it comes up just short and that will be par. Theegala does indeed miss that putt at 15 after an indifferent bunker shot and drops back to one under. On commentary, Paul McGinley says DeChambeau has gone from skinny, to big, back to skinny again. He says Darren Clarke was the same and he used to have about four wardrobes depending on his weight. I think Clarke probably did a bit less gym work than DeChambeau. Theegala is in a spot of bother at 15. He chips out of a greenside bunker but leaves it well short and has plenty of work to do for his par. Looking likely to drop back from two under. Hovland, Conners and Fox and now all tied at three under par atop the leaderboard \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but no! Conners rolls in an excellent 30-foot putt on the 15th, and he is four under par and clear of the chasing pack, with three holes remaining of his first round. Conners has three birdies in four holes. An impressive par putt from Scheffler at the sixth, despite the fact he drove his first shot into a sand trap. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two under par. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m struggling to find a reliable source for the leaderboard here. The official website leaderboard appears to be quite a long way behind, and the one via Google doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look right. Do email me with your US PGA leaderboard of choice. They would not tolerate this at Augusta, they really wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. McIlroy misses a par putt, and drops back to five shots off the lead, spoiling that momentum he was starting to pick up. Where will he be when Scott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back from his break? Viktor Hovland now joins Fox on three under par at the top of the leaderboard, while Bryson DeChambeau is up to two under par, through 10. Ryan Fox comes within millimetres of chipping in his second at the 16th \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then he fluffs an incredibly short birdie putt, and taps in for par, looking a bit sheepish, as well he might. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He just needs to finish the round off now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Ewen Murray in the commentary box. Thanks Scott. Here we are then. The sun is shining at \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 where are we again? Oak Hill Country Club, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. Sky Sports are replaying some of the round\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest hits thus far, including a couple of cracking iron shots by Viktor Hovland and Corey Conners. Meanwhile, Scottie Scheffler rolls in a birdie putt to move to two under par. So he joins the group on two under, that also includes Conners, Hovland and Theegala, behind the outright leader Fox on three under. McIlroy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eagle putt is always missing on the high side. But a tap-in birdie will more than suffice, and suddenly the shoulders aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t slumped and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that Roryesque spring in his step again. Facing dropping down the standings to +4 or worse, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suddenly got himself back to +1. This is why, despite all the wild inconsistencies, and eight years of major-championship near-misses, the man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still box office. One way or another, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take your eyes off him. With that, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m leaping out of the hot seat to make room for Luke McLaughlin. See you again in an hour, at which point Rory could be leading or propping up the entire leaderboard. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all part of his charm. Speaking of Rory, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suddenly sparked into life. That par saver from the bottom of the swale on 2 was a once-in-a-blue-moon 37-foot rattle. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s since hit closest to the pin on 3 for birdie, and now hit the longest drive of the day down the long par-five 4th, a 347-yard fairway-splitter. He creams his second into the heart of the green, and will have a look at eagle from 30 feet or so. Meanwhile Jon Rahm tidies up for his bogey at 2 to slip to +3, while Keegan Bradley drains a monster across 18 to get back into red figures at -1. Another dropped shot for Jordan Spieth, this time at 3. At +3 the career-slam dreams aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet over for another year, but his putter is stone cold. Meanwhile back on 2, Jon Rahm sends his approach over the back from the centre of the fairway, then watches in horror as his chip up from Rory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Swale rolls back to his feet. He pulls out the putter second time round, and gets up onto the green, but only just, if nothing else proving just how magical McIlroy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s putt was. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to steer in an eight-footer for bogey. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golf! (pt.XXXVIII in a continuing series) Ryan Fox had been Mr Consistent, until flaying his tee shot at the risk-or-reward short par-four 14th into deep trouble down the right. But he flicks a wedge through a small window in the trees, bumping his ball onto the fringe to the right of the green. From where \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of course he does \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he rams home a putt for the unlikeliest of birdies and sole ownership of the lead! -3: Fox (14) -2: Conners (13), Hovland (11*) Perhaps that absurd par-saving putt from the bottom of the swale at 2 has revitalised Rory McIlroy! Because he arrows his iron at the par-three 3rd to a couple of feet, and tidies up for his first birdie of the day. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +2, and for all his travails, is suddenly just four shots off the lead. Once more with feeling: that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golf! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fluid all right. Viktor Hovland rakes one across 2 and the birdie gives him a share of the lead. Meanwhile Kazuki Higa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s round continues to unravel, with bogey at 7. Having risen as high as -4, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back to level par. -2: Fox (13), Conners (12), Hovland (11*) -1: Theegala (13), Scheffler (12*), Thomas (11*), Tarren (10), McNealy (8*), Suh (8) While all that bedlam was going on, Corey Conners nearly holed out from 100 yards at 12. He taps in for a birdie that brings him up to -2 alongside Ryan Fox and Sahith Theegala \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and then Theegala fails to get up and down from the side of 13 for a second consecutive bogey, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all change at the top again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely fluid at the top of the leaderboard, with the only constant seemingly the 36-year-old Kiwi Fox, who has parred seven and birdied one of his last eight holes. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 McIlroy elects to putt up the slope rather than chip. And he judges it perfectly! The ball only just gets up and over the crest of the hill, but then rolls out and grabs the right-hand edge of the cup, dropping and sending the crowd into raptures! He shrugs at his caddy, which is the correct reaction to the absurdity of golf. From the ridiculous to the sublime! Could that kick-start him back into action? My word, he needed that. He remains at +3! A double-bogey six for Jordan Spieth on 1. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s punishment for hooking his tee shot up against the face of a bunker, after which he was always chasing position. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +2, and the career-slam-chasing Texan flings his ball away more in disappointment than frustration. Meanwhile similar bother awaits Rory McIlroy, who takes a fairway wood from the 2nd tee for position, then sends his ball into the thick rough anyway. He powers towards the front of the green, only to send his third down the swale to the back. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in proper bother here, given he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already +3. But then \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The wind is picking up at Oak Hill. As though the course wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t playing tough enough. Send anything into the rough, and par suddenly becomes a proper job of work. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to miss fairways and greens, bunkers are best, a fact illustrated by Callum Tarren at 10. He finds a fairway bunker down the left, then another guarding front right of the green, before splashing out from 70 feet to kick-in distance. So close to holing out for a birdie that would have given him a share. He remains one behind at -1. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and as quickly as Sahith Theegala finds himself sole leader, he drops a shot himself, pulling a six-footer for par on 12. Meanwhile JT and Rory make their pars at 1 to remain at -1 and +3 respectively. This course is playing like an old-school US Open all right. -2: Fox (13), Theegala (12) -1: Higa (15*), Conners (11), Scheffler (10*), Thomas (10*), Hovland (9*), Tarren (9), Suh (8), McNealy (7*), DeChambeau (7*), Bradley (6*) Yes, things can change quickly in golf all right. Kazuki Higa sends his tee shot at the monster par-four 6th into bother down the left, and can only punch out from under some hanging branches. His fourth finds the green, but only 30 feet away. Two putts lead to a double bogey six, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back to -1. Meanwhile on the par-three 15th, Keegan Bradley pulls his tee shot into the bunker that cost Collin Morikawa a bogey earlier, but from which Cam Smith scrambled par sensationally. The 2011 champion can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hold the green with his blast out, and fails to chip close from the thick stuff behind the green. He misses the ten-foot putt, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a painful double that knocks him back down the standings to -1 as well. -3: Theegala (11) -2: Fox (13) Justin Thomas effs and jeffs as his drive at 1 heads towards the out of bounds down the right. But he gets a break, and then manufactures a draw through the trees and into the heart of the green. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left with two putts from 70 feet for his par, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a result all told. Meanwhile his playing partner Rory McIlroy misses the fairway to the left, trudges down the hole with his head hanging, then gathers himself to power a wedge out of the cabbage to the middle of the green. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a look at birdie from 30 feet, and if that goes in \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well, things can change quickly in golf, right? Poor chap needs something of a boost, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping. Sahith Theegala tidies up for his birdie at 11. He joins the leaders. A star-studded pack chasing them. -3: Higa (14*), Theegala (11), Bradley (5*) -2: Fox (12) -1: Scheffler (9*), Conners (10), Thomas (9*), Morikawa (9*), Hovland (8*), Smith (7*), Tarren (8), McNealy (6*), Suh (6) Jon Rahm can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get up and down from the fringe to the side of 16, and one of the pre-tournament favourites slips back to level par. Scottie Scheffler, the other pre-tournament favourite, had completed the back nine in 34 strokes, a very tidy card that features eight pars and a birdie; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level par. But the man who was (let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it, inexplicably, given his recent form) third favourite in the betting, Rory McIlroy, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t salvage his par on 18. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three shots dropped in four holes, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 38 strokes over the back nine for the two-time champion. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +3 and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to watch him struggle like this. Could this be the shot of the day? We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had some contenders already \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Corey Conners at 6, Scott Stallings at 10, Viktor Hovland at 15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but this could be the best of the lot. Sahith Theegala creams a high draw into the long par-three 11th, his ball stopping 18 inches away from the cup. So close to a most elegant ace. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll surely tidy up to move into a share of the lead at -3. News when we have it. McIlroy ended up in a bunker at 18 from which he could only take a large gulp of medicine. Having splashed out, he pulls his approach left and long, but gets a huge break off the camber of the bank and his ball pings onto the green, stopping 15 feet behind the flag. A chance to scramble an unlikely par, despite being all over the shop, though he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still got a face on. He is fuming. Rory sends a huge slice towards the tents lining the right-hand side of the 18th hole. Steam pouring out of the lugs, he swipes wildly and indiscriminately with his driver and nearly takes out a PGA tee sign plus a nearby boom mic. Fortunately he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t connect with either. Further up the hole, Gary Woodland is also feeling far from mellow, having troubled a nearby grandstand, then, upon sending his next shot onto the green, being told \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There you go!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by an extremely patronising punter. Woodland will understandably demur, but that heckle was delivered with exquisite comic timing and at exactly the right cadence to get immediately under the skin. Golf is hard enough as it is. Rory McIlroy can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get up and down from greenside sand at 17, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two strokes shipped in three holes. A steady start has turned into a poor one in double-quick time. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +2. But back on 15, Cam Smith responds to that egregious yip on 15 with some steely work at the par-three 16th. He pulls his tee shot into the bunker on the left, from where Collin Morikawa earlier ran up bogey. But Smith whips bravely high into the air, up over the steep face to six feet, the best that he could feasibly do. In goes the par saver, and he remains at -1. Sahith Theegala would be a popular winner all right. The 25-year-old Californian is coming off the back of a top-ten finish at the Masters, and has started the second major of the year very well indeed. Having opened with a bogey, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birdied 4, 8 and now 9, hitting the turn in 33 after whisking a chip out of deep rough at the back of 9 and dribbling it down the green and into the cup. The crowd go wild but he celebrates modestly. -3: Higa (12*), Bradley (4*) -2: Fox (10), Theegala (9), Conners (8) -1: Scheffler (8*), Thomas (7*), Morikawa (7*), Hovland (6*), Tarren (6), Smith (5*), Rahm (5*), Suh (5), Mernok (4*), McNealy (4*) After three birdies in a row, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back-to-back bogeys for Callum Tarren. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly lucky the damage at 6 was only the one stroke, to be honest: he pulls his second towards Allens Creek and only the thick grass on the bank keeps him dry. He can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take advantage of the break, failing to chip close, and walks off having dropped back to -1. Keegan Bradley grabs a share of the lead with a monster putt on 13! A huge downhill right-to-left swinger for birdie. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -3. Corey Conners makes his third birdie in four holes with a 20-footer on 8 to move to -2. Meanwhile on 14, Cam Smith stands over an 18-inch birdie putt \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only for it to horseshoe out. Wow. He gathers himself and tidies up for par. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real shocker. He remains at -1. A disappointing morning for Matt Fitzpatrick. The reigning US Open champion cards back-to-back bogeys at 13 and 14, and slips to +2. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll no doubt be taking that double whammy in sanguine fashion \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not least because as fast as things unravel, you can always bounce back in similar speed. See the work so far of Viktor Hovland: the young Norwegian, surely a major champion in waiting, started with bogeys at 10 and 12, but has just made three in a row, the latest at 15 after arrowing his tee shot straight at a tightly-positioned flag. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -1. A disappointing three-putt bogey for Callum Tarren at 5. He slips out of a share of the lead. The 2011 champion Keegan Bradley is alongside him in second, having started 3-3-3, with birdies at 10 and 12. This PGA hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite sparked into life yet \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only Thursday morning, after all, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intriguing if nothing else. -3: Higa (10*) -9: Fox (9), Tarren (5), Bradley (3*) Harold Varner III chips in from the front of 17. It only saves his par \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that keeps him in red figures at -1. Collin Morikawa can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tickle in his downhill par putt from the fringe at 15 and he slips back to -1. Meanwhile Morikawa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing partner Rory McIlroy also fails to get up and down from sand, and his opening run of pars is broken by a bogey. A big par save for the co-leader Kazuki Higa on 1. Well short of the green in two, he gets up and down to remain at -3. Up on 9, Ryan Fox joins Collin Morikawa in second spot with birdie that moves him to -2 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 though how much longer will Morikawa be there alongside him? He pulls his tee shot at the par-three 15th into the bunker. Shortsided, he can only send his ball flying hysterically past the flag and onto the fringe at the back. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to make a tricky 15-footer to save his par. Callum Tarren joins Kazuki Higa in the lead at -3! A third birdie on the bounce, this time at the par-five 4th. Meanwhile it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back-to-back birdies for the 2020 champ Collin Morikawa, the latest at the short par-four 14th, and the top of the leaderboard suddenly has a fresh look. -3: Higa (9*), Tarren (4) -2: Morikawa (5*) The shot of the day so far, by Corey Connors on the monster par-four 6th (formerly the 5th). Creamed straight at a flag tucked away on the left-hand side of the green, water to that side, from 214 yards to kick-in distance. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back-to-back birdies for the 31-year-old Canadian, who has three top-ten finishes at the Masters, yet very little else on his major-championship r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -1 now. Mind you, Maverick McNealy puts in a bid of his own seconds later, whipping out of thick rough to the side of 12 and in. The 27-year-old American, who hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite delivered on his early hype, moves to -1. Callum Tarren had a decent US Open last year, finishing in a tie for 31st at Brookline. The 32-year-old from Darlington hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done much else in the majors, but starts fast this week, with birdies at 2 and 3 to grab second spot for himself. Also moving in the right direction: Scottie Scheffler, who makes a wonderful birdie on the short par-four 14th after pulling his tee shot into thick rubbish to the left of the green. With a lot of ground to cover, he whips a high lob out of the filth to ten feet, then rattles in the birdie chance with supreme confidence. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s -1. -3: Higa (9*) -2: Tarren (3) A couple of stunning bunker shots from two serious contenders. Jordan Spieth bashes out of a deep greenside trap at 13 to a couple of feet. The birdie brings him back to level par. One hole ahead, Brooks Koepka sends his tee shot into sand front-right of the green, then whips out to tap-in distance. The two-time PGA champion also moves back to level par for his round. The Open champion Cameron Smith sends a 40-foot tramliner up the 12th green and into the cup. Right into the centre. Never missing. Meanwhile the 2020 champion Collin Morikawa birdies the par-five 13th and also moves into red figures. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re -1. But up on 17, the leader Kazuki Higa finds thick rough down the left of the hole with his drive; always out of position, he ends up with his first bogey of the day. -3: Higa (8*) -1: Grillo (6*), Fox (6), Lee (6), Varner III (6*), Stallings (6*), Johnson (5), Kitayama (5), Morikawa (4*), Thomas (4*), C Smith (3*), Rahm (2*), Hodges (2), Tarren (2), Meronk (2*), Suh (1), Bradley (1*) The par-five 13th is playing at 617 yards today. It could be set up longer later in the week, but even today, big-hitting types such as Scottie Scheffler and Brooks Koepka can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reach in two. Both wedge their thirds in. Koepka pulls his onto the bank at the left, but gets a huge break as the ball hops out at a right angle and stops eight feet from the cup. Scheffler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wedge in is a bit clumsy: he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the spin he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s after and the ball rolls ten feet past. Neither can make their birdie effort, and remain at level par and +1 respectively. Ryan Fox is unable to get up and down from a greenside bunker at the par-three 5th, and he slips back into the pack at -1. Meanwhile the leader Kazuki Higa is able to make a sandy save, whipping delightfully out of a trap at 16 to kick-in distance. Incidentally, that chasing pack includes Colin Inglis, one of the PGA Team of 20 club pros. Inglis missed the cut last year at Southern Hills, but whatever happens from here, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always be able to say he was tied for second at one point in a PGA Championship. -4: Higa (7*) -1: Inglis (6*), Grillo (5*), Fox (5), Lee (5), Varner III (4*), Stallings (4*), Riley (3*), Z Johnson (3), Thomas (3*), Rahm (1*), Donald (1*) Jordan Spieth is hoping to complete the full set of major championships this week. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not off to the best start, following up bogey at 10 by sending his tee shot at the long par-three 11th into the bunker guarding the front. He knocks his second to eight feet, from where par\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far from a certainty \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but he rolls the putt into the centre of the cup to stem the bleeding. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s +1 and a nightmare start has just been averted. For the third hole in a row, Brooks Koepka gets sloppy hitting into the green. This time it costs him. Having sent his second up a hillock to the side of the putting surface at 12, he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bump down close enough, and upon missing the putt slips back to +1. One of his playing partners, Gary Woodland, also drops a stroke after pulling a relatively short par putt. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the fast starts of Higa and Fox fool you: Oak Hill is playing like a US Open course, long and with penal rough, accuracy with the big stick a necessity. Some confirmation of that from the Sky colour man Wayne Riley: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oak Hill will eat you up, bite you, and spit you out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pretty much a perfect start to the round for Jon Rahm. Having found the fairway with a long opening drive, he wedges to 12 feet, then calmly rolls in the birdie putt. Fair to say that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a better start to the PGA than the one he made at Augusta last month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a four-putt double bogey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and look what happened there. The rest of the field have been put on notice. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jonny! The world number one belts a monster down 10. Up on the green, disappointing bogey starts for Viktor Hovland and career-slam-chasing Jordan Spieth. Meanwhile Ryan Fox follows birdie at 2 with another at the 617-yard par-five 4th, joining Scott Stallings in second place, a couple of strokes behind the leader, whose birdie blitz comes to an end with par at 15. -4: Higa (6*) -2: Fox (4), Stallings (3*) Some outrageous nonsense from Brooks Koepka on 11. Having sent his tee shot into the gallery, he whistles his wedge through the green and just over the other side. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left with a delicate little bump out from thick oomska near a bunker \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and of course clips it out, sending it on an inevitable journey into the cup for par. One of those shots that looked in from the moment it left the face of the club. He remains level par. Pars for Scheffler, Koepka and Woodland at 10. Koepka follows that up by pulling an awful long iron at the 245-yard par-three 11th into the gallery. Following behind, Justin Thomas starts the defence of his title by sending his second from rough safely into the heart of the green, then draining a 30-footer for birdie. Par for Rory. Meanwhile on the subject of fast starts, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kazuki Higa with yet another birdie, this time at the short par-four 14th. For the record, Higa has missed the cut in his last five starts. Now look! -4: Higa (4*) -2: Stallings (3*) Kazuki Higa snatches the lead for himself outright. A fuss-free perambulation down the 13th, one of the two par-fives at Oak Hill, and a textbook birdie. The 28-year-old hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t won in Europe or the USA yet, but has six victories in Japan to his name, four of those coming in the last 13 months. He looks totally in control of his game, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three birdies in a row. -3: Higa (4*) -2: Stallings (2*) -1: Fox (3), Lee (3), Holmes (1*), Riley (1*) Back on the 10th tee, the 2012 and 2014 winner Rory McIlroy tees it up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to the biggest cheer of the morning, it has to be said. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in the greatest form at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c missing the cut at Augusta hit hard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always box office and the gallery has his back. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the fairway. Neither does the 2016 and reigning champion Justin Thomas. The 2020 champ Collin Morikawa makes it three misses out of three, spraying his out to the right. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Slept good last night, did everything I was supposed to do,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rory tells JT as the pair set off down the hole, hands in pockets, both smiling in the relaxed fashion. Koepka, the only member of the group to have found the fairway, ends up furthest from the flag after an extremely average wedge in. Scheffler, the wildest from the tee, sets up the best birdie chance, gouging out from the thick, wet rough to 12 feet. Pin high. Golf, eh. The world number two Scottie Scheffler tees it up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and finds the long rough down the left of 10. Then the 2018 and 2019 champion Brooks Koepka unsheathes the driver and launches one down the right-hand side of the fairway. The final member of the group, the 2019 US Open winner Gary Woodland, follows Scheffler into the long stuff. The course is going to fill up quickly with some very big names during the next 30 minutes or so. Kazuki Higa responds by raking a straight 35-foot birdie putt in on 12! For a second, it looks like his effort is only going to roll 35 feet minus the width of one blade of grass, stopping momentarily on the edge of the cup, but after a crowd-teasing split second, the ball starts turning again and drops. A look of high amusement spreads across Higa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face. Less than an hour in, and the 105th PGA Championship has already dished up some top-quality entertainment. -2: Higa (3*), Stallings (1*) -1: Grillo (2*), Lee (1) The first birdie of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Championship has been made by Kazuki Higa. The 28-year-old from Japan is making his PGA Championship debut this week, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hanging around. He fires his tee shot at the long par-three 11th to 12 feet and rolls in the putt. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not leading the tournament, because the first eagle of the week has been made by Scott Stallings, who holes out from 128 yards on the 10th \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two little bounces by the hole then a quick spin to the left and in! The 38-year-old from Massachusetts has no major-championship record to speak of at all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c his best finish was a tie for 26th in last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Masters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading one now. Just another 71 holes to go. -2: Stallings (1*) -1: Higa (2*), Grillo (1*), Lee (1) Micheel is going round this morning with Braden Shattuck, one of the 20 PGA club professionals in this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s field. Shattuck sliced his opening drive into bother down the left, but recovered well to scramble his par. An opening par four for Micheel as well. Most welcome on a hole regarded by the great Ben Hogan as the hardest opening hole in golf. Anyway, while we wait for the first of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big-name starters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Scottie Scheffler and Brooks Koepka will be teeing it up at 2.50pm BST, soon to be followed by the likes of Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Jordan Spieth, Jon Rahm, Matt Fitzpatrick and Cam Smith - allow our man at Oak Hill, Ewan Murray, to set the scene. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 105th PGA Championship. This is the 8.50am starting time. On the tee, from Tennessee, the 2003 PGA Champion, please welcome Shaun Micheel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And so, one hour and 50 minutes after schedule, Micheel hits the first shot of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Championship. A 3-wood creamed down the middle. Hey, any old excuse to revisit the 7-iron that won him the title 20 years ago, right? Yes, it may be mid-May but this is upstate New York \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and an overnight frost has set us back by a couple of hours. The first group will now tee off at 8.50am (1.50pm BST), with revised tee times to follow. More from PA: Play had been scheduled to get under way at 7am local time (12pm BST), but predictions of an overnight frost proved accurate. Tournament organisers released a statement early on Thursday morning which read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Due to frost, all Oak Hill Country Club practice facilities and the golf course are currently closed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To protect playing surfaces, everyone on-site must stay off any grass and gates will not open until the frost clears,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the statement added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Starting times for round one will begin approximately 1hr and 15 minutes after practice facilities open.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are two players defending the Wanamaker Trophy at Oak Hill this week. Well, kind of. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the reigning champion Justin Thomas, of course. JT won his second PGA Championship in record fashion last year at Southern Hills, coming from seven shots back on the final day to pip Will Zalatoris in a play-off, after 71-hole leader Mito Pereira blew it by driving into the drink at the 72nd. If this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunday shenanigans are even halfway as dramatic as that, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be doing pretty well for ourselves. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also Phil Mickelson. Lefty won at Kiawah Island in 2021, beating Brooks Koepka down the stretch to become the oldest major champion in history. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to officially defend that title last year, withdrawing from the field after some injudicious LIV-inspired chat, and now that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s back \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well, of course he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not actually defending this week, but you know how elite-level sportspeople think, and in his mind he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have relinquished nothing. His age (53 next month) and form on the LIV tour suggest he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got no chance; his outrageous second-place finish at last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Masters argues differently. Other golfers are available! The world number one and new Masters champion Jon Rahm; the in-form world number two Scottie Scheffler; Jordan Spieth, trying to complete the career slam; the Cams Smith and Young; the reigning US Open and recent Heritage champion Matt Fitzpatrick; the fast-shooting Brooks Koepka and his glacial-paced nemesis Patrick Cantlay (preferably in the final pairing on Sunday for some comedy fireworks, come on golfing gods, make it so); the resurgent Jason Day; a European charge by Viktor Hovland, Shane Lowry or Tyrrell Hatton; some home heroics from Xander Schauffele, Max Homa, Tony Finau or Collin Morikawa; a possible Korean coup courtesy of Tom Kim, Im Sung-jae or Kim Si-woo. Oh, and taking up the role of lovable but teeth-grindingly frustrating underachiever in Sergio Garcia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absence, Rory McIlroy. Even more golfers are available! Apologies if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed the obvious, or your favourite, but there are 156 players in the field, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be here all day.

The prime minister has been invited to attend the summit in Hiroshima, which along with Nagasaki was devastated by the US atomic bombing in the closing stages of the second world war. Albanese is due to arrive in the city on Friday afternoon and will join the mayor of Hiroshima for a visit to the Peace Memorial Park, including the ruins of the former industrial promotion hall now known as the A-bomb dome. A Nobel prize-winning group, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), has written to Albanese to urge him to make good on Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to join a new treaty to impose an outright ban on nuclear weapons. The party platform said a Labor government would sign and ratify the treaty, after taking account of factors including the need to work to achieve universal international support. Ican cited Albanese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech championing the treaty in 2018 when he denounced nuclear weapons as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate weapons ever created\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the 2018 National Labor Conference, you showed what strong leadership on this issue looks like,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the letter from the co-chairs of Ican Australia, Dr Margaret Beavis and Associate Prof Marianne Hanson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You now have the unique responsibility to show the world once again what leadership on this critical issue looks like. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We urge you to take the opportunity to advance Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position on this treaty when you visit Hiroshima.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The letter argued the acquisition of nuclear-propelled, conventionally armed submarines under Aukus \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sharpens the need for a binding and permanent commitment that Australia will not possess, host or assist with the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons now or in the future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is a relatively new treaty that imposes a blanket ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or helping other countries to carry out such activities. The TPNW now has 92 signatories, 68 of which have formally ratified it. But it is opposed by the United States and other nuclear weapons states, which argue it is out of step with international security realities. The former Morrison government said the treaty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terms were inconsistent with Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obligations under the US alliance. In November, the US embassy in Canberra warned that the TPNW \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would not allow for US extended deterrence relationships, which are still necessary for international peace and security\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Talei Mangioni, 29, who is a PhD candidate at the Australian National University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s School of Culture, History and Language, addressed a youth summit in Hiroshima late last month. She hopes Albanese makes progress on the issue. The Ican Australia board member said she was touched to hear directly from hibakusha (survivor) Keiko Ogura about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153invisible scars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the 1945 bombing and about visits to Japan by Pacific activists in the 1980s. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the moment Australia is really out of step with the rest of the region,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Mangioni, who is of Fijian and Italian descent and whose research focuses on the Nuclear Free and Independent Pacific Movement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most Pacific countries have either signed or ratified the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. If he were to commit to the TPNW, I think it would send a great message to the region. The nuclear test legacy is a very serious issue in the Pacific and also for Aboriginal communities in Australia.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd During the Albanese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first year in office, Australia has taken some cautious steps to engage with the TPNW, including sending a backbencher as an observer to the first meeting of the parties in Vienna last June. Australia followed that up by shifting its position at a UN committee in October to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153abstain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after five years of actively opposing the treaty under the Coalition. But Albanese and senior ministers have avoided giving a clear timetable for joining the TPNW. Responding to a question from the independent MP Zoe Daniel in March, Albanese said a world without nuclear weapons \u00e2\u20ac\u0153would be a very good thing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we will do, though, is work systematically and methodically through the issues in accordance with the commitments that were made in the national platform,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told parliament. Australia is not a G7 member but has been invited by Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, to attend the Hiroshima summit as an outreach partner. Albanese said the government was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153showing the world that Australia is back as a partner, a leader and a force for stability and growth in our region\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The leaders of the four Quad countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Australia, Japan, the US and India \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are expected to have a meeting on the sidelines this weekend. It follows the cancellation of next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Quad summit in Sydney after the US president, Joe Biden, cut short his regional travel to deal with the debt ceiling crisis. On Friday Albanese is expected to meet with the South Korean president, Yoon Suk Yeol, and the Brazilian president, Luiz In\u00c3\u00a1cio Lula da Silva."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/may/18/tupac-shakur-way-oakland-california-name-street-after-rapper", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "Tupac Shakur Way: California city to name street after iconic rapper", "lead": "Shakur lived in Oakland in the early 1990s and has other connections to the city, including filming a video there", "author": "Aben\u00c3\u00a9 Clayton", "datePublished": "2023-05-19T00:04:07Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036229", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a85afc02f916e577679979f01c6afe25be433213/0_211_3600_2160/500.jpg", "body": "A northern California street may soon bear the name of late rapper Tupac Shakur. On Tuesday, Oakland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s city council unanimously agreed to name a part of a city street after the rapper, who called the city home in the early 1990s. A stretch of MacArthur Boulevard by Lake Merritt where Shakur once lived will keep its existing name, but also receive the additional, honorary name of Tupac Shakur Way. Commemorative plaques and signs signaling the change will be paid for by the Tupac Shakur Foundation. Shakur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s connection to the city goes beyond the lessons he learned while living in the city in the early 1990s. In 1991 he sued the Oakland police department for $10m after police slammed him to the ground and arrested him during a jaywalking stop in downtown Oakland. The case was ultimately settled for $42,000. Shakur also filmed the video for one of his most well-known songs, Brenda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Got a Baby in the city. The song and music video tells the tragic story of a teenage mother who is murdered. Shakur was 25 when he was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996, and he has remained one of the most recognizable rappers in the hip-hop community. Shakur is the son Afeni Shakur, a racial justice activist and member of the Black Panther party. Tupac would often point to his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activism as a driving force behind his socially conscious records and outspokenness about police brutality, racism and poverty. He wrote the 1995 single Dear Mama in honor of the late organizer, who died in northern California in 2016. There is no timeline for the street name addition. The city council legislation says the renamed part of the street will remind people of Shakur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contributions to Oakland and celebrate art and culture as a catalyst for societal change.

The first US state-level ban of the increasingly embattled social video app is already proving controversial, although it will not take effect until 2024. Why has TikTok been banned? According to Montana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, Greg Gianforte, the move was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to protect Montanans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 personal and private data from being harvested by the Chinese Communist party\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ban comes after a federal move to stop government employees using the app on their work phones. That was followed by administrations around the world, but Montana is one of the first in the latest wave to extend a ban to consumer users as well. How will the ban take effect? The bill, which was introduced in February, targets app stores such as those run by Google and Apple, prohibiting them from hosting TikTok. Lobbyists linked to the companies have argued that enacting such a state-level ban will be impossible, but any significant difficulty is likely to be legal rather than technical, given that the services already collect enough information about individual users to identify their state of residence. TikTok itself could also be hit with a fine if it continues to operate in the state after the ban comes into effect. A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to reassure Montanans that they can continue using TikTok to express themselves, earn a living and find community as we continue working to defend the rights of our users inside and outside of Montana.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Neither Apple nor Google responded to requests for comment. Will it be easy to enforce? There are many ways for users to evade geographic bans on the open web, from using a VPN service, which reroutes connections to other locations, to signing up for accounts using prepaid cards and rented mailboxes. Fully closing off access to the app would be nigh impossible unless Montana decided to follow the route of countries such as Iran or, ironically, China itself, and greatly limit access to such services. Olexandr Kyrychenko, a partner at the IMD Corporate law firm, said no TikTok users would be fined because the bill targets companies rather than individuals. He also said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eyewatering\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd $10,000 (\u00c2\u00a38,000) a day fine would encourage companies to comply. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would certainly be a costly gamble to keep download options available once the bill comes into force and app stores would be well advised to comply,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Will the ban face legal challenges? A group of TikTok creators has already sued to block the ban, arguing that the law violates their first amendment rights. The users said the state seeks to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exercise powers over national security that Montana does not have and to ban speech Montana may not suppress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Montana can no more ban its residents from viewing or posting to TikTok than it could ban the Wall Street Journal because of who owns it or the ideas it publishes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the lawsuit said. The ACLU has described the ban as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unconstitutional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear if TikTok itself will file suit. Has anywhere else succeeded in banning TikTok? India banned the app in 2020, citing a wave of dangerous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153challenges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that had led to the deaths of some users, but critics argued that the real motivation was the same geopolitical wrangling that has resulted in western nations starting to clamp down three years later. The ban had a marked effect on competition in India, handing a significant market to YouTube\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shorts service, a direct competitor of TikTok hastily released in the country in the wake of the ban. TikTok is also banned in China itself. A sister app called Douyin, also owned by TikTok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company, Bytedance, shares many features but with much firmer moderation."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/19/i-may-have-fallen-in-love-with-a-sex-worker-i-am-paying-could-it-be-real", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "title": "I may have fallen in love with a sex worker I am paying.

So even though it really feels true, that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily a sign that it is true. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one we all face: it really seems true that your kid is a phenomenally talented artist, or that your cat is in the 99th percentile of cuteness \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but of course, your love for them would make you think that, so despite how strongly it feels true, you have to admit it might not be. You know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a debunking problem here. You pay her to make you feel adored, and when you do feel adored, it really feels true. But you also know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve asked her to trigger that feeling, so its intensity isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a guide to the truth. Does she have feelings for you? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not impossible. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not probable, either. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not impossible. Still, I think the thing in the circumstances is to resolve that if she has feelings for you, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll tell you. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the only sign that you could take to be a true indication that she has feelings for you . And I think it is important not to stoke the hope that one day she will say that. Not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m waiting to see\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m committed to thinking she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have feelings for me, unless she actively says otherwise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this matters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy the connection that you have with her. She provides this intimacy in exchange for money, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true. But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still allowed to experience it as intimacy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so deeply important for us to be able to feel connected to others if want to be; seen and held if we want to be. Sometimes we get experiences that meet that need by purchasing them. People who want touch can buy massages, people who want sexual intimacy can buy it, people can even buy time to talk uninterrupted and just be listened to. These are all deeply valuable experiences and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing wrong with taking genuine succour and restoration and rejuvenation from them even though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been bought. Professional relationships are just that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c professional \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop them from being genuine sources of care. She provides intimacy in exchange for money; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re allowed to feel that intimacy. You might also be pleasantly surprised by what this relationship could provide in the long term, even if she has no feelings for you at all. Sometimes experiencing the thing we need in a professional setting can make it easier to find and maintain it outside that setting. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be thinking about endings or transience, either; sometimes relationships like this can last for years. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing wrong with savouring the feelings you get from this relationship \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as long as you recognise it as just that: a feeling, and not a guide to the truth. *** Ask us a question Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

Labour accused the government of lacking ambition in its announcement, while one UK startup said the \u00c2\u00a31bn figure was less than the cost of one basic semiconductor plant. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-awaited national semiconductor strategy would focus on the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing strengths in the technology. Semiconductors, or microchips, are the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of electronic devices, formed by wafers of silicon that are key to most forms of modern technology, from cars, smartphones and kitchen devices to power stations. Under the strategy, the planned decade-long investment would be targeted at areas such as design, research and development. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Semiconductors underpin the devices we use every day and will be crucial to advancing the technologies of tomorrow,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the prime minister, Rishi Sunak. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our new strategy focuses our efforts on where our strengths lie, in areas like research and design, so we can build our competitive edge on the global stage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Concerns over the fragility of the global semiconductor industry have been heightened by the Covid pandemic, when a surge in demand for electronic devices triggered a chip shortage, and by fears that China planned to invade Taiwan, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest manufacturer of semiconductors. The strategy, to be released in full on Friday, avoided committing to the huge subsidies announced by the US and EU. China also committed multi-billion-dollar sums to boosting semiconductor production. The US pledged $52bn (\u00c2\u00a342bn) in subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing and research, while the EU drew up a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac43bn (\u00c2\u00a337bn) investment plan for the sector, which included member state subsidies and contributions from the private sector. The EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has warned against a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subsidy race\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over semiconductors. According to details released by the government ahead of the full document release, up to \u00c2\u00a31bn in funding would be spent over the next decade, with an initial spend of up to \u00c2\u00a3200m in 2023-25. Other areas of focus will be compound semiconductors, which are made from different elements. MPs have described the UK semiconductor industry as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153comparatively small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when measured against Asian countries and the US, with clusters in Scotland, south Wales, Cambridge, and the north-east and south-west of England. The government said the funding would be used for projects such as improving access to specialist equipment, investing in the industry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153talent pipeline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and other business support. This would be aided by new bodies, including a UK semiconductor advisory panel and an incubator to assist new semiconductor businesses. The strategy also planned to mitigate supply chain threats by working with other countries such as the US, Japan and South Korea. Labour said the government had shown a lack of ambition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rather than the \u00c2\u00a31bn headline, the reality is \u00c2\u00a3200m over the next three years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c significantly less ambition than our competitors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lucy Powell, the shadow secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport. Cambridge-based startup, Paragraf, which claims to be the only company in the world capable of manufacturing graphene to mass-produce semiconductors, said the taxpayer commitment would not cover a basic chip plant. Its founder and chief executive, Simon Thomas, said the content of the strategy revealed so far was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153frankly flaccid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strategy continues the trend of this Conservative administration proclaiming superlatives like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbecoming a technology superpower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 without defining what \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuperpower\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actually means or delivering a plan of how we will even begin to reach this objective,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. However, one UK semiconductor manufacturer described the strategy as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153meaningful step forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. David Moore, the chief executive of Cambridge-based Pragmatic Semiconductor, which makes compound chips, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really good start in terms of looking at how we take this strong pedigree in many respects in the UK and how we drive it forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sunak stressed the importance of semiconductors as he flew to Japan for the G7 summit, where he agreed a new partnership on the technology with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida. The UK and Japan are concerned by the threat to the semiconductor supply if China invades Taiwan, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest producer. Japan is also a major player and the UK would like to boost its own sector. As part of a new agreement, the Hiroshima accord, the UK and Japan will launch a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153semiconductors partnership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with new commitments to pursue ambitious research cooperation and planning to prevent shortages.

The Progress Educational Trust\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (PET) report highlights \u00e2\u20ac\u0153utter confusion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a lack of knowledge among GPs about eligibility criteria for NHS-funded treatment, which it says is exacerbating the so-called IVF postcode lottery. GPs typically make the initial referral to fertility clinics, meaning that they play a crucial role in access. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For NHS treatment, GPs are the main initial gatekeeper. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not getting pregnant, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s who you go to for advice and support,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sarah Norcross, the director of PET. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It struck me that, when people have a known cause of infertility, male GPs still weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t passing them on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The report is based on a survey of 200 GPs and commissioners across England, carried out by an independent research company, which investigated knowledge of national fertility guidelines and criteria they use for referral decisions. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) is reviewing its fertility guidelines, which have not been updated in 20 years. It currently recommends that women under 40 years should be offered up to three full cycles of IVF on the NHS, if they or their partner are infertile. However, GPs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 day-to-day decisions are constrained by local criteria, set by commissioning groups, and only about 10% meet the Nice guidelines. Many areas offer only one funded IVF cycle. Even given regional variation, the PET report suggest GPs are sometimes not referring eligible patients, and it found that a doctor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s age and gender could play a role. In the case of a known cause of infertility or reduced fertility (which would automatically make a patient eligible under Nice guidelines) 52% of male GPs said they would refer for treatment compared with 73% of female GPs. For patients who had tried to get pregnant through regular unprotected sex for one year, 57% of male GPs said they would refer, compared with 66% of female GPs. Younger and less experienced GPs were also more likely to refer patients for IVF treatment. There also appeared to be lack of clarity about the defined completion point of an IVF cycle, with only 16% of GPs correctly identifying that it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153when all viable embryos are transferred\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as stated in the Nice guideline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These survey results show that there is utter confusion over the current Nice fertility guideline,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Norcross. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our results should send a strong message to the government, NHS England, the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health ambassador and commissioning bodies. The lack of understanding of the guideline by GPs is making the postcode lottery worse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The survey found a majority of GPs (54%) stated that they had seen a change in referral criteria, with almost all access requirements set by local commissioning groups becoming more restrictive in the past two years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sadly, over the last three years, we have seen a huge drop in support for people requiring fertility treatment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Prof Adam Balen, of the University of Leeds, a former chair of the British Fertility Society. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not only are couples finding it very difficult to get an appointment with their GP, but when they do, there is a huge lack of knowledge about testing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a reluctance to initiate investigations, and refer for treatments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite clear national guidelines.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nearly three-quarters of GPs have received a complaint about access to fertility treatment, with 10% having received more than 10 patient complaints in the past 12 months. Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is clear from this survey that the complexity of fertility treatment pathways across the country, and how this relates to Nice guidance, can cause confusion, both amongst GPs and patients \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this needs to be addressed. GPs understand how distressing fertility issues can be for patients and the impact these can have on many aspects of their health and lives, and will do what they can, in accordance with local policies, to support them, based on their individual circumstances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hawthorne added that the criteria by which GPs should refer patients are set by local policies, decided by integrated care boards (ICBs), which in many areas do not align with Nice guidance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In England, it is ICBs that determine how many cycles of IVF can be offered to a patient on the NHS, not GPs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Prof Geeta Nargund, a senior NHS consultant and medical director at Create Fertility, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the one in seven couples who have difficulty conceiving, the PET survey findings are both shocking and deeply worrying. Already, these couples have to navigate an IVF postcode lottery, which leaves many patients priced out of fertility treatment and unable to access treatment simply due to where they live. That there is also significant inconsistency and misunderstanding in how GPs are interpreting Nice guidelines suggests that even couples who are entitled to NHS-funded fertility treatment might be missing out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prof Richard Anderson, co-director of the Centre for Reproductive Health at the University of Edinburgh, said that the wide variation in eligibility criteria across England needed to be addressed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an appalling situation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In Scotland, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got equal pathways across the whole country.

Grocery bills that had rocketed by almost 20% during the past year would continue to increase, replacing energy prices that were expected to begin falling over the next few months, the Resolution Foundation said. The thinktank said it was not clear that politicians were prepared for another year of food price rises or that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153policy debates have caught up with the scale of what is going on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Official figures released next Wednesday are predicted to show that the annual rate of inflation fell in April by about two percentage points from the 10.1% figure for March. The drop to single digits will be a relief for households and businesses that have come under intense financial pressure from rising prices. However, the pace of decline is expected to slow as firms push up the price of food. The Bank of England warned last week when it increased interest rates to 4.5% that it was concerned that inflation as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) would fall more slowly this year than it previously expected. It raised its inflation forecast for the fourth quarter of 2023 from 3.25% to more than 5%, warning that it might need to raise interest rates further to pull the CPI rate down towards its 2% target. The Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, Andrew Bailey, told business leaders on Wednesday he was concerned that food and other non-energy prices would remain elevated, eating into the disposable incomes of millions of households. Food prices usually fall in the summer as UK crops replace more expensive imports. But factory gate prices for milk, meat and other foods has accelerated, in some cases by more than 50% year on year. The Resolution Foundation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report, Food for Thought, says food prices are expected to contribute \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more to overall inflation than energy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the months ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Between March and September 2023, food prices are expected to contribute around 2 percentage points to inflation each month, while the contribution of energy prices is set to fall from 3 percentage points to less than 1,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the report estimates. The cost to the nation from higher food prices since the 2019-20 financial year would be \u00c2\u00a328bn by the end of the summer, compared with an extra \u00c2\u00a325bn cost from higher energy prices, it added. Lalitha Try, one of the report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authors, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone realises food prices are rising but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less clear that the scale of the increases has been understood in Westminster.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What rising food prices have in common with surging energy bills is that they pose a greater challenge to lower-income households, who spend a higher proportion of their income on food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 15%, compared with 10% for the highest-income households in 2019-20. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a result, the effective inflation rate for the poorest 10th of households was almost 50% higher compared with the richest 10th of households in March.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/may/18/liv-rebel-bryson-dechambeau-muscles-his-way-into-early-lead-at-us-pga-championship", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "LIV rebel DeChambeau muscles his way into early lead at US PGA Championship", "lead": "Bryson DeChambeau was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreally confident\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after his opening round of 66 gave him a first-round lead at the US PGA Championship", "author": "Ewan Murray at Oak Hill", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T22:32:12Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036308", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/256bfd8577bd0f53a1493bbd6d42fd9bcb63118a/0_86_5028_3017/500.jpg", "body": "It has been easy to forget the permanent theatre that surrounds Bryson DeChambeau. Not so long ago, golfers both professional and amateur were trying to emulate the approach of this supposed pioneer. Bomb and gouge won the day as DeChambeau prevailed at the 2020 US Open. His ascent took him to No 4 in the world rankings. Bryson Land has never been dull. This is the man who publicly insisted Augusta National played as a par 67 for a man of his strength. He once signed a Masters flag for a golf fan seeking out past champions of the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening major on the basis he would inevitably join that company. DeChambeau lacerated his equipment manufacturer, became embroiled in a long-running feud with Brooks Koepka and attracted derision for comments about the Covid vaccine. Yet a switch to the rebel LIV tour, some chronic loss of form and a serious hand injury meant DeChambeau had in effect vanished from view until day one at this, the 105th US PGA Championship. A slimmed-down DeChambeau \u00e2\u20ac\u201c his calorie intake is now 2,900 a day from an earlier high of 5,000 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c planted himself atop the leaderboard with a first round of 66. As if to prove drama remains a backdrop, he cracked a fellow player with a ball courtesy of a loose second shot to the 17th. Kenny Pigman, who took a blow to the back, was not meaningfully hurt. For the first time in a while, DeChambeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance overshadowed all other matters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fantastic round of golf at Oak Hill,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the 29-year-old. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a prestigious place. Very difficult golf course. As I was looking at it throughout the week, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m like, man, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how shooting under par is even possible out here. But, luckily, I was able to play some really good golf, hit a lot of fairways, did my job and made some putts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Naturally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is DeChambeau \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there followed an element of bizarre conversation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I took a Zoomer peptide test, which essentially tells you what inflames your blood when you eat,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was allergic to corn, wheat, gluten, dairy. Pretty much everything I liked, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat. I took that out. Started taking it out in August and over the course of time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lost all this inflammation, lost a lot of fat and slimmed down like crazy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I lost 18 pounds in 24 days. It was crazy. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fat. It was all water weight. You know how I looked before, I was not skinny. So a lot of changes in that regard. Obviously, having the hand injury was no fun and then learning to play golf again with a new hand. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a while.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Whether DeChambeau can maintain this level over another 54 holes is, of course, open to question. In his favour is that Oak Hill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s setup is not dissimilar to Winged Foot when he won that US Open. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel really confident but golf is a weird animal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said DeChambeau. Takes one to know one etc. As DeChambeau completed media duties, Rory McIlroy was battering drives down the range as he sought to iron out swing problems which were once again apparent during a one-over-par 71. McIlroy recovered admirably from the position of plus three after nine but was unconvinced by his golf. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was not at my best,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said McIlroy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was pretty messy out there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The 2012 and 2014 US PGA champion is also short of his physical best. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fighting something,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said McIlroy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought I got a great night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep last night. I took a look at my Whoop [a fitness tracker] and I was at 22% recovery. My skin temperature was three and a half degrees higher than what it has been. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m fighting something. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I actually feel better today than I felt yesterday, so plenty of water and a bit of rest, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scottie Scheffler eased his way towards a 67. Corey Conners and Dustin Johnson are also three under. Ryan Fox, who has only just recovered from a nasty bout of pneumonia, has Viktor Hovland, Adam Scott and Keegan Bradley for company at minus two. Scott painfully double bogeyed the last. Jon Rahm, the recently crowned Masters champion, slumped to a 76. Matt Fitzpatrick matched that score after failing to record a single birdie. Justin Thomas, the 2022 winner, and Koepka were among those to sign for a 72. A large chunk of Thursdayafternoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wave will have to complete their opening rounds on Friday morning after frost caused a delay of almost two hours to the start of play.

Sirens screaming and faces emoting, they battle through another dark-night-of-the-soul as they deal with gang shootings, domestic assaults, homeless people dying and crack addicts giving birth in hovels. They are often assigned the futile chore of attending to corpses discovered in decaying buildings, surrounded by black flies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t all the other patients just corpses in waiting? And so the black flies of horror start buzzing into their brains. Tye Sheridan co-stars as Ollie, the standard-issue Hollywood rookie, a fresh-faced young ambulance guy from Colorado (of all the poignantly innocent places) paired in time-honoured style with a grizzled old-timer. This is the seen-it-all Gene Rutkovsky, appropriately nicknamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rut\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a veteran of a million horrors, including 9/11, played by Sean Penn. Fights break out among the guys back at the station house and Mike Tyson has a cameo as the grouchy chief who has to keep everyone in line. Poor Ollie is terrified on his first day in the chaos, but the wryly amused Rut takes pity on him, looks out for him, and becomes his partner, a careworn Virgil to his Dante in the Big Apple inferno. Of course Ollie comes to adore Rut, but will he have to cover up for him? Ollie is a medical student, who is doing this job to pay the bills while he prepares to retake a medical exam, and of course there are no prizes for guessing if the horror of the job is going to seep into his soul, and whether he will then get through it to become a more compassionate and mature adult. The obvious comparison is with Martin Scorsese\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paramedic drama Bringing Out the Dead from 1999, co-written by Paul Schrader, with Nicolas Cage as the emergency guy letting the job get to him, and Sheridan has already played a not dissimilar rookie figure opposite Oscar Isaac in Schrader\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gambling movie The Card Counter. But Black Flies is simply trading on old ideas. As for the female characters well, there do not appear to be any female paramedics in New York. There are female patients and Ollie has a girlfriend (Raquel Nave), with whom his relationship goes sour, and Rut has an ex-wife (Katherine Waterston) and a daughter on whom he dotes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but being a paramedic is in this film a stag party. The movie has its moments, largely Ollie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s horrified realisation about an awful truth in the paramedic business; that there is an unacknowledged euthanasia aspect to the job, a secret world of letting no-hope cases die in the back of the ambulance to keep the whole business viable. But overall the vital signs of this film are not great. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Black Flies screened at the Cannes film festival."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/may/18/europa-league-and-europa-conference-league-semi-final-second-legs-live", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "West Ham, Fiorentina, Roma and Sevilla reach European finals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "<strong>Football clockwatch:</strong> West Ham will face Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final, while Sevilla face Roma in the Europa League final", "author": "Michael Butler", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T22:19:14Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036316", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1c714cf1e22dbcbd0ec4b505a1d07a89ac5a4d5c/0_88_5390_3235/500.jpg", "body": "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going for a lie down.

A great night, though. West Ham reach their first European final since the Cup Winners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Cup final in 1976. Woof! They will meet Fiorentina in the final. You have to say that Sevilla deserved their win over the two legs against Juventus. They were the better side in Turin and showed great composure to get back into the match after Vlahovic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opener. Both goals from Suso and Lamela were peaches.

Let them have their flowers. Europa League: Sevilla v Roma Europa Conference League: West Ham v Fiorentina. Heartbreak for Basel. They defended so well. Barak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal will hurt for a long, long time. Fiorentina progress, where they will face West Ham in the final. And Fiorentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win here means there is still a chance for an Italian side to win all three European competitions, with Internazionale in the Champions League final and Roma in the Europa League final. Juventus are out! Sevilla have qualified for their seventh Europa League final. Their record is absolutely astounding. Played six finals, won six. Roma await for Sevilla in the final. Oh my word! Fiorentina have done it in the 129th minute of the match. Wow. Wow. Wow. Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez crosses, Jovic nods it back across goal, Ndoye misjudges his header, and Barak is all alone at the back post. Time stands still as the Czech player has time to take a touch and stab the ball past Hitz. The Swiss are stunned. I am stunned! Sevilla 2-1 Juventus (3-2 agg) 120 min: A succession of corners as Juventus put the squeeze on. Rekik, the former Man City centre back, is one of those at the back to help Sevilla get the danger away. The pressure releases as the ball comes out to Paredes, and the World Cup winner shoots over the bar. Sevilla 2-1 Juventus (3-2 agg) 117 min: Juventus are playing route one now, but Bounou comes to claim with authority. That red card for Acuna means that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be suspended for the final of course. What a boost for Roma. 115 min: Acuna has been sent off for timewasting! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s his second yellow card, and now Sevilla will have to play with 10 men for the final five minutes of extra time. Basel 1-2 Fiorentina (3-3 agg) 118 min: Basel are hanging on. Ikone latches onto a dreadful goal kick and curls a shot with the outside of his boot just wide. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just a couple of minutes away from a penalty shootout now. Sevilla 2-1 Juventus (3-2 agg) 112 min: Rakitic hits the deck as the clock continues to tick in Seville. Juventus can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to get anything going. Declan Rice talks to the camera: You should see the lads in [the dressing room]. Mark Noble is in there singing songs, singing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBowen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on fire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWest Ham are massive\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re absolutely buzzing to reach the first European final in 43 years. Dutch teams always keep the ball well but we knew we could catch them on the counter and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we did. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m trying to write history as the captain. We just want to make the fans proud, our families proud. Should mention there were some ugly scenes after the final whistle in the Netherlands. AZ fans appeared to clash with the away support, as the frustration of the result got the better of the home fans. Worryingly, it appears that some of the players got caught up in the skirmish, perhaps as they went to check on their families? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear. Aaron Cresswell and Lucas Paquet\u00c3\u00a1 were certainly involved. Juventus will surely throw everything at this now. Kostic is on, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a fine cross on him. Vlahovic, Milik, Rabiot, all to aim for. Sevilla an unusual change: Navas off for Papu Gomez. A wing back off for an attacking midfielder. Hmmm. Basel are looking extremely leggy, and seem content to hang on for penalties. Fiorentina have brought on former Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic, still just 25 years old, as they try to find a winner. Sevilla 2-1 Juventus (3-2 agg) 100 min: Vlahovic climbs highest, but he can only direct his header at Bounou. Sevilla will surely try and kill the game from here. There are few better than that than Rakitic. What is it about Sevilla and the Europa League? Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop. Tottenham loanee Bryan Gil created the goal, and former Tottenham star Erik Lamela finished, it. Sevilla have looked dangerous from wide areas all night, and Lamela steals in to nod powerfully past Szczesny. The stadium goes absolutely bananas. The camera is shaking in the stand. Wow. Juventus have to respond! Europa League: Sevilla 1-1 Juventus (2-2 agg) Europa Conference League: Basel 1-2 Fiorentina (3-3 agg) 90 min: Peeeeep! Extra-time begins in our two remaining ties. Mourinho is through to his sixth European final as a manager. A defensive masterclass. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pretty, but try telling that to the Roma fans in the away end. Mourinho goes to greet them, his fists in the air. Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Roma (0-1 agg) 90+7 min: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still going in Germany. Roma are eking this one out! Abraham wins a free-kick right in front of the dugouts. The Englishman is playing for time and winks after he hits the deck. Xabi Alonso is exasperated, and gets a booking for protesting to the referee. Just one more minute to hold on for Roma. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done it! West Ham will play one of Basel or Fiorentina in the final.That game will be decided in extra time. The away fans, all 800 of them, are going crazy. Some of the AZ fans are not best pleased. David Moyes is a football genius! West Ham are into the Europa Conference League final! AZ stream forward in numbers, and West Ham hit them on the break! Fornals picks the ball up, nutmegs a defender and sprints towards the goal. He looks like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run out of steam, but hits a shot at goal, and it finds the bottom corner! Hammers in dreamland! Another one that will go the distance. To extra time we go! 90 min: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sevilla doing all the pushing for a winner. Suso has been very influential since coming on, and not just because he scored that howitzer. Three minutes added on for injury time. AZ 0-0 West Ham (1-2 agg) 86 min: Nervy times for West Ham! De Wit goes up for a high ball with Zouma and Areola. All three of them fail to make clean contact, and the ball falls to the ground, hitting Zouma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arm on the way down. Is that a penalty? It was certainly in the area but would have been harsh. Areola is also lucky that the ball didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bounce away from him. It could have gone anywhere but it bounced off Zouma and into the goalkeeper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arms. AZ 0-0 West Ham (1-2 agg) 83 min: AZ simply can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get around the low block of West Ham. Seven minutes to go for the English side to reach a European final. Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Roma (0-1 agg) 78 min: Great chance for Azmoun. Wirtz takes a heavy touch, as Roma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defenders swarm around the playmaker, but the ball bobbles off a head and falls perfectly on Azmoun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right boot. But the Iranian drags his shot just wide. Rui Patricio was rooted. Leverkusen are knocking on the door! Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Roma (0-1 agg) 76 min: Roma may not have had a man sent off, but they are doing a very good impression of Mourinho\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inter side that somehow beat Barcelona in the 2010 Champions League semi-finals. Tah tries his distance from range, a la Kompany, but it takes a deflection off Matic, I think. The Argentinian gets his second goal of the night! He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quickest to respond to the second ball in Basel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s box, and laces a brilliant shot into the far corner with his left foot. Three-three on aggregate! What a hit! Chiesa loses possession, Acuna and Lamela combine and the ball finds Suso on the edge of the box, rides a challenge from Locatelli, and arrows a shot into the top corner. Szczesny has no chance. We are all square again! Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 66 min: The Ram\u00c3\u00b3n S\u00c3\u00a1nchez Pizju\u00c3\u00a1n is stunned. But Sevilla come roaring back to stir their stadium back into life. The crosses continue to come, Gudelj nods across goal but En-Nesyri is unable to turn the ball in at the back post. It was at an awkward height, around his waist. Vlahovic scores with his second touch! He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only been on the pitch for 60 seconds. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fortuitous opening, but Vlahovic takes the chance with supreme class. The Serbian bundles his way through two tackles, is one-on-one with Bounou, and the Juve striker dinks a finish over the Sevilla keeper! What an impact! Juventus are ahead! Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 62 min: Changes for both sides. Sevilla go first. Suso, formerly of Milan, is on for Torres. Juventus respond by bringing on Vlahovic and Chiesa. Two big time players. Di Maria and Kean off. Both sides trying to win it in the 90. AZ 0-0 West Ham (1-2 agg) 60 min: West Ham have entered their time-wasting phase. Both Soucek and Kehrer have been given yellow cards for dawdling when the ball goes dead. Gives you some idea of the attacking enterprise from the English side. They will go score now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve written that. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 58 min: Bremer goes close for Juventus! The away side have soaked up the pressure from Sevilla and were inches away from taking the lead on the night and inthe tie. Paredes crossed for Bremer, up for a set piece, and the Brazilian headed down towards the corner, but the ball just bounced wide. Bounou was scrambling. He was worried. Basel lead the tie once more! Amdouni latches onto a lofted pass, gets the better of Dodo, and curls a wonderful shot past Terracciano to restore the Swiss side\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead in the tie! How many times has Amdouni done that for Basel in this campaign? Basel looked lifeless but now they are level on the night. Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Roma (0-1 agg) 51 min: Wirtz is a special footballer, but he has cut a frustrated figure so far for Leverkusen. Roma doing a good job of stifling him. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 49 min: Acuna takes aim, his squat thighs gearing up for a thunderbolt, and the Sevilla left back flashes his shot a couple of yards wide from the edge of the box. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some viewers might be asking themselves what this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSPQR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 company is on the Roma shirt,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd emails K\u00c3\u00a1ri Tulinius. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The story there is that they used to be sponsored by a distasteful crypto company who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay their bills, so the club took the logo off the shirt and replaced it with and older brand, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSenatus PopulusQue Romanus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, which is how the Roman Republic used to identify itself and its armies to the world, and is widely used today in the eternal city.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd AZ 0-0 West Ham (1-2 agg) 47 min: If you were hoping for more West Ham updates here, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the game has been preposterously boring at AZ. Which is just how Moyes will like it. Peeeeeeeeep! We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back underway in all four of the matches. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Sevilla-Juve match is a humdinger,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd emails Colum Fordham. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153End to end stuff. I have to admit, as a Naples-based Liverpool and Napoli fan, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not exactly rooting for the Turin side. Acuna and Navas are playing superbly. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love a final between the Spanish side and Roma who my Italian in-law Flavio is a big fan of.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I should mention a couple more incidents from that first half in Seville. 1) The home side were extremely unlucky not to get a penalty after Fagioli twice handled in Juventus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 box. 2) A brilliant turn from Kean saw him work some space in Sevilla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s box, before smashing a low shot at the far corner. But Bounou stuck out a right leg, toeing the ball onto the post and away! Half-time reading: Particularly enjoy the image of Gazza\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre-match order as part of the 1990-91 squad: Lasagne (and cornflakes). I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have liked to have seen him make that order when he was in the Lazio squad. In the Premier League, Newcastle are doing rather well against Brighton. Europa League Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Roma (0-1 agg) Europa Conference League AZ 0-0 West Ham (1-2 agg) Basel 0-1 Fiorentina (2-2 agg) The only goal of the evening, then, in Basel. No away goals, remember. I have no idea how there has not been a goal. Sevilla had a very strong claim for a penalty in the final moments of the half, Torres flicking the ball over Cuadrado before clear contact, but VAR rules that Cuadrado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (faintest) touch on the ball is enough for it to be judged a clean tackle. Which it clearly wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Ah. Leverkusen have hit the bar, but Roma are Mourinho-ing their way to the final, as things stand. In all that excitement, I missed a goal in Switzerland. Nicol\u00c3\u00a1s Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez heading in, direct from a corner! Game on! The Hammers will be happy. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 45 min: What a game it is in Seville. Like a basketball game. End to end, tackles flying in, chances. Remarkable that there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been a goal. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 44 min: Moise Kean is a lucky boy! Already on a yellow card, the striker appears to stamp on Ocampos after a collision. The Italian actually \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmissed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 his stamp, so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make contact, but the intent was there. Ocampos wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t initially happy, pushing his rival in the chest, but actually did a good job of not playing up to the situation. Kean could easily have been sent off there. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 42 min: Juventus have the ball in the net! But Rabiot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strike is ruled out for offside! Locatelli is released down the right, reaches the ball at the byline, pulls the ball back, and Rabiot is there on the penalty spot to sidefoot the ball into the roof of the net. But Locatelli is a few inches off, as VAR draw their lines. The correct decision. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 39 min: Gudelj catches Fagioli, and it looks like the Juventus man is going to have to come off. Yep, Fagioli is carried off on a stretcher, with the midfielder covering his face. That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look good. AZ 0-0 West Ham (1-2 agg) 37 min: Lots of possession for AZ, but not a lot of end product. West Ham will be happy enough as the clock ticks down towards half-time. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 35 min: If Juventus allow Sevilla to keep crossing the ball with no pressure on the ball, this is only going to go one way. Oliver Torres finds space on the right, fizzes one low to Ocampos, and the Argentinian sweeps his shot straight at Szczesny. A couple of yards either side and that could have been the opener here. Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Roma (0-1 agg) 33 min: Massive blow for Roma. Spinazzola has pulled his hammy, so will have to come off. When the Italian international is on song, as he was during the Euros a couple of years ago, there are few better left-backs. On comes Zalewski. Straight swap. 30 min: Half an hour gone, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as you were. Europa League Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Roma (0-1 agg) Europa Conference League AZ 0-0 West Ham (1-2 agg) Basel 0-0 Fiorentina (2-1 agg) AZ 0-0 West Ham (1-2 agg) 26 min: West Ham hit the post! Paqueta finds some space on the edge and curls on onto the outside of Ryan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far post! Very close, the Australian keeper was beaten there. Benrahma also has a decent opportunity from the edge of the box, but the Algerian skies his effort. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 23 min: Wonder save from Szczesny! How has he kept that out?! Another cross comes in from the right, Ocampos dives to head the ball at the near post, and Szczesny dives to his left, somehow clawing the ball out. Wow! Sevilla piling on the pressure. Basel 0-0 Fiorentina (2-1 agg) 20 min: Dangerous free-kick for Basel on the right, and there are appeals for a penalty as Calafiori goes down in the box. But nothing is given. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 15 min: I was really impressed with Bryan Gil in the first leg. The Tottenham loanee has proved rather lightweight in the Premier League although he did have a good run of form before returning to La Liga earlier this season. But he showed a real dynamism in Turin, gliding past his markers, and played a key part in Sevilla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal. Should have had an assist when he sent En-Nesyri through on goal, but the Moroccan striker couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t finish his dinner. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 11 min: Juventus are coming back into it. Gatti is unmarked in Sevilla\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s penalty box, but the Juve defender can only power his header straight at Bounou. Should have done better! Bayer Leverkusen 0-0 Roma (0-1 agg) 9 min: Diaby crashes a shot off the bar for Leverkusen! The Frenchman is so quick, and he bursts through on goal, leaving Ibanez for dead. Diaby takes the shot early, even from a wide angle, taking Patricio by surprise. The ball pings off the crossbar and away from danger. Very close to being an outrageous strike. Hard to be critical here, but could have have taken another touch, or cut inside? Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 7 min: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a similar story in Seville. The home side have all of the ball, Juventus can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a kick. Navas is being given the freedom of the right wing to put cross after cross into the box. AZ 0-0 West Ham (1-2 agg) 5 min: AZ have started really well, stroking it about. West Ham are set up to play on the counter-attack. Sevilla 0-0 Juventus (1-1 agg) 2 min: Huge mistake from Cuadrado! He falls over the ball in his own box, Rakitic pounces, drives to the byline but can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a Sevilla man with his cutback. The Ram\u00c3\u00b3n S\u00c3\u00a1nchez Pizju\u00c3\u00a1n Stadium is a sea of red in Seville in support of the home side. Juventus are wearing a pink and blue away kit, a sort of Crystal Palace knock-off. Coveted after Morrocco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine run at the World Cup, Sofyan Amrabat will be at the heart of Fiorentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s midfield tonight alongside the vastly experienced Giacomo Bonaventura, who scored and was sent off in the win over Udinese at the weekend. Interesting that Jonathan Ikon\u00c3\u00a9 doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normally a menace down the right flank but has to make do with a place on the bench. I enjoyed this interview with AZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager, Pascal Jansen. There are some familiar names in the AZ team. Jordy Clasie, formerly of Southampton, and Mat Ryan (formerly of Brighton and briefly Arsenal). But keep your eyes out for Milos Kerkez, the marauding Hungarian left back. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a talent and should keep Jarrod Bowen busy. Islington-born Samuel Iling-Junior starts for Juve, keeping Enrico Chiesa out of the side. He looked very lively when he came on during the first leg against Sevilla, and is making a big impression in Turin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 20-year-old scored his first Serie A goal earlier this month at Atalanta. The boy is a bit special. Sevilla v Juventus Sevilla: Bounou, Jesus Navas, Bade, Gudelj, Acuna, Fernando, Rakitic, Ocampos, Torres, Gil Salvatierra, En-Nesyri.

Two night of European drama already this week, and now we have four bumper European ties. A bit of everything in here, from fallen giants to resurgent underdogs, with even a bit of British interest thrown in for good measure. Sevilla v Juventus remains the tie of the night. Tied at 1-1 from the first leg, the Spanish side will be kicking themselves that they were not able to close out a win in Turin, as Federico Gatti scored with a header seven minutes into added time to earn a draw. Sevilla, winners of this competition on 794 occasions, should have been out of sight, really, but Juve rallied late on, and an assist from Paul Pogba (sadly injured again for tonight) to set up Gatti leaves this tie on a knife-edge. In tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other Europa League semi-final, Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Mourinho (Roma) holds a narrow advantage over Xabi Alonso (Bayer Leverkusen) after Bove struck at the Stadio Olympico. Bayer Leverkusen are looking to reach their first European final since the 2002 Champions League final, and will have some job halting Mourinho, who remains on course for back-to-back European titles after last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conference success. Speaking of the Conference League, here come the Hammers. West Ham came from behind to beat AZ in east London, with Michail Antonio bundling the ball over the line with 15 minutes left to comple the turnaround. But the star of the night was undoubtedly this chap, who must be about eight years old, going on 40. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to get \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAlphabet FC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 out of my head all week. Basel v Fiorentina completes our line-up. A stoppage-time goal from Zeki Amdouni earned the Swiss a 2-1 win, but hopes are high in Florence, with Viola hitting some form in the second half of the season.

A study, presented at the European Congress of Obesity in Dublin, involved creating a simulated food delivery app and conducting three randomised controlled trials involving 23,783 adult participants. In each trial, participants were asked to choose a meal for themselves like they would in real life and then the number of calories in their basket at checkout was measured. The research was led by Dr Filippo Bianchi and was sponsored by Nesta, a UK foundation and charity partly focused on health. It looked at different interventions within the app, including pre-selecting smaller portions by default, positioning lower-calorie foods more prominently, and displaying calorie labels. There was also a control group where the simulated app had no changes. The results show that all for all three trials in which the app was altered, the purchases involved a lower number of calories on average. While the control group purchased an average of 1,408 kcal, the three trials recorded reductions of up to 15%. The use of food delivery apps, which include Deliveroo and UberEats, has increased by 55% since 2015, with 25 million adults in the UK using them regularly. Studies have shown that takeaway foods are often high in calories, with 47% of meals containing at least 1,000 kcal or more, which is about half of an adult\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daily recommended energy intake. The study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendations included that food delivery apps provide a filter letting users switch calorie labels on and off; communicate recommended energy intake per meal and not just per day; and avoid framing calorie label messaging or formatting as judgmental, such as by using red font. Bianchi said the findings provided \u00e2\u20ac\u0153encouraging proof-of-concept evidence that small tweaks in delivery apps could help many people to identify and select healthier foods\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding:. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Testing similar initiatives with real restaurants and delivery apps will be important to assess the long-term impact of these interventions in the real world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Delivery apps could reach millions of people and help us select healthier food options, and yet there is very little research looking at what works to promote healthier and more nutritious options in these settings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said Britain is on track to become the most obese nation in Europe. In a major report published last year, it said the growth of meal delivery apps, especially during the pandemic, was driving the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obesity crisis. Speaking at a press conference, Anna Keleher, a behavioural scientist at Nesta, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All industry does have a responsibility to their consumers and to public health, so as delivery apps become a larger piece of that pie, so does their responsibility grow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Deliveroo spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deliveroo is proud to bring consumers the best selection of food from restaurant and grocery partners in their local area, and this includes a large range of healthy choices. We also make it easy for consumers to find healthier choices through improved in-app navigation, and for restaurants to display calorie information on their menus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/may/18/bleak-expectations-review-criterion-theatre-london", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Bleak Expectations review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c agreeably funny Dickensian spoof as cosy as a woollen teapot", "lead": "Caroline Leslie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production sends up the less problematic Victorian foibles with a terrifically spirited barrage of juicy one-liners, blunt anachronisms and pleasing melodrama", "author": "Brian Logan", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T22:00:10Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036323", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/037b73d66b4f41c0bc7db0805fabbcf92e07b303/0_80_2400_1440/500.jpg", "body": "As a commercial prospect, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fault this stage refit of the Dickensian Radio 4 comedy Bleak Expectations. Hit shows cannibalised from the broadcast media (see another recent Watermill theatre hit, Spike) bring fans along with them. Celebrity guest stars \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Stephen Fry inevitably among them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are promised. Dickens himself remains an audience favourite. You might even point to the current zeal for deconstructing the Victorian age and its accomplishments, and the racist and colonial assumptions that underpinned them. Actually, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not point to that. About the era\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sexism and sexlessness, Bleak Expectations jokes relentlessly. About more topical controversies, it has little to say, leaving undisturbed the jollity that results when you satirise only those 1800s foibles we all already agree on. It does this with considerable vim, as the cast of characters familiar from the airwaves reassemble. Narrator Sir Philip Bin (played, tonight, by Sally Phillips) recounts the tale of his youth and young manhood, his father killed by penguins while on imperial business, his mother driven mad, his sister abducted by the scoundrel Gently Benevolent. Young Pip ends up at St Bastard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boarding school (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please sir, can I have some less\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), before fleeing to London to make his fortune in the trash-can trade.

There are also, in Mark Evans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 script, lots of juicy one-liners, blunt anachronisms (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153number 13, Total Tosspot Street\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, indeed), and pleasingly ridiculous twists of melodrama (see: moustache-twiddling baddie using a kitten as an inkwell). The cast, too, is terrific, particularly John Hopkins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 beastly Benevolent, Rachel Summers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 frustrated Ripely Fecund, marooned in the sister zone and Marc Pickering show-boating as the several Hardthrasher siblings and a three-man jury all at once. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that kind of show, with nothing new to say about our Victorian past (far less the present), and lots of funny ways of saying it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At the Criterion theatre, London, until 3 September"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/18/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-review-harrison-ford-cracks-the-whip-in-taut-sequel", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny review: Harrison Ford cracks the whip in taut sequel", "lead": "There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still much to dig about the octogenarian archeologist as he teams up with Phoebe Waller-Bridge to re-defeat the Nazis", "author": "Peter Bradshaw in Cannes", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T21:32:27Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036326", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/246fae4e802038c5c6c5d90365523aba09d97eca/582_0_2676_1607/500.jpg", "body": "So the boulder of intellectual property and franchise brand identity rolls on \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 bringing us Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, the fifth film in which the legendary archaeologist and whip-cracking adventurer is back for another go-around. He is, of course, played by the legendary Harrison Ford, now 80 years young, but carrying it off with humour and style and still nailing that reluctant crooked smile. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first Indiana Jones film not to be directed by Steven Spielberg \u00e2\u20ac\u201c James Mangold is now at the helm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but despite that, this one has quite a bit of zip and fun and narrative ingenuity with all its MacGuffiny silliness that the last one (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We all sat down to this movie hoping for a resurgence comparable to what JJ Abrams did with The Force Awakens, and if that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly happen, it still gets up a storytelling gallop. Phoebe Waller-Bridge has a tremendous co-star turn as Indy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roguish goddaughter Helena Shaw, who wears shorts and shirt making her look like a grownup, naughty Enid Blyton heroine. And in fact some amazing digital youthification effects give Indy himself a great opening flashback section back in the second world war. Back in the bad old days of 1944, with the Third Reich beginning to crumble, intrepid young spy Indiana Jones is captured by the fiendish Nazis along with his pal, Professor Basil Shaw, in which small role it is a pleasure to see Toby Jones. They grab what the Germans want: the extant half of a much-desired artefact created by Archimedes, the Dial of Destiny, which allows its owner to control the forces of space and time, but which Archimedes prudently split into two and hid the other half. A chase with a nasty German, J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Voller (Mads Mikkeksen) leaves this whole business unresolved but fast-forward to the present day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Space Age late 60s, and grumpy old Indiana Jones is retiring, miserable at his irrelevance in the modern world. But this same Voller under a fake name is the brains behind the Apollo 11 moon landing, having conned the US federal government, represented by Agent Mason (Shaunette Ren\u00c3\u00a9e Wilson) and still dreams of controlling the universe and reintroducing Nazism by joining the Dial\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two halves. Only Indy can stop him, along with his scapegrace godchild Helena who is in fact making a dodgy living flogging antiquities on the black market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and she has a cheeky sidekick in tow: Teddy (Ethann Isidore). There are plenty of jolly chases, including a tuk-tuk vs classic Jag event in the narrow streets of Tangier and for the Indy purists, some creepy encounters with insects and an underground tomb whose passageways open up with a grinding noise. It is probably a bit cheeky to be giving Ford a young female co-star under this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153goddaughter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tag, with a bantering tension that is really not too different to a (platonic) co-star he might have had in the original movies. Yet the finale is wildly silly and entertaining, and that Dial of Destiny is put to an audacious use which makes light of the whole question of defying ageing and the gravitational pull of time.

The mood had turned acrid at the AFAS Stadion, with hooligans shaming the beaten hosts when they found the pain of defeat too much to bear and responding to the final whistle by charging at the pitchside section housing West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sponsors, club officials and the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s families. It was carnage for a few minutes, David Moyes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s players understandably furious when they realised what was happening. Yet it would not be long before Declan Rice, West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imperious captain, was leading his teammates towards the away end to celebrate Moyes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resilient side reaching their first European final in 47 years. They had done so by keeping their cool and, for all that West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of care in possession made the second leg of this Europa Conference League semi-final unnecessarily anxious at times, nobody could dispute that they deserved to go through after winning 3-1 on aggregate. Ultimately it never seemed likely that AZ would find a way through the wall of black shirts protecting Alphonse Areola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goal. Yes, the statistics at the end had suggested an evening of Dutch dominance. AZ had more shots, more of the ball and more corners. Yet Pascal Jansen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s young side would pay for their lack of incision and in the end it was not a surprise when Fornals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clinical goal gave West Ham the chance to dream of beating Fiorentina in the final in Prague on 7 June. There were, of course, some hairy moments during the second half. With 20 minutes left Rice could be seen urging his leggy teammates to give it one last push. West Ham had to dig deep and, from AZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective, there will be questions over whether the game would have turned out differently if they had been given a penalty for Nayef Aguerd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risky foul on Vangelis Pavlidis just before the hour. Equally there was never a genuine sense that Rice would finish on the losing side. The midfielder has a plan to leave east London on a high, and there would be no better way to sign off than by helping West Ham win their first trophy since 1980. There is no chance of anyone of a claret and blue persuasion begrudging Rice his move if he plays this well against Fiorentina. The midfielder was everywhere, repeatedly putting out fires, although he did not do it alone. It was a professional display from West Ham. Moyes, who has never won a trophy, made no apologies for focusing on keeping a clean sheet. The Scot has endured a difficult season; now he stands one win away from cementing his place as a West Ham legend. It all felt so much more restrained compared with last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heartbreak against Eintracht Frankfurt in the last four of the Europa League. West Ham blew that tie, Aaron Cresswell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s red card in the second leg summing up their lack of composure, but here they were calm. They were in control after fighting back from a goal down to win the first leg and were determined not to give AZ hope of a turnaround. It was not entirely clear why the hosts were unbeaten in 25 European home games. West Ham simply looked stronger and fitter, while they had fun when Lucas Paquet\u00c3\u00a1 had the ball. The Brazilian was a delight to watch at times, his footwork a level above, and he would go closer than anyone to scoring during the opening period. He deserved better than for his bending drive to clip a post after fine hold-up play from Michail Antonio. By that stage AZ had been reduced to hopeful pot shots from long range. They played in front of West Ham and were struggling to get enough bodies into the box. It was too easy for Aguerd and Kurt Zouma to keep heading the crosses away. Jansen needed his side to take more risks in the second half. There was more hope when Milos Kerkez broke through, the left-back\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross just evading Pavlidis. Suddenly the Dutch side were pressing. West Ham had to wake up when the midfielder Tijjani Reijnders almost released Pavlidis. A response came from Rice testing Mat Ryan from 25 yards. Yet West Ham were starting to wobble. Their wingers, Jarrod Bowen and Sa\u00c3\u00afd Benrahma, were not doing enough. AZ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belief was growing and Thilo Kehrer, who was booked for time-wasting, went close to disaster when he almost turned a cross past Areola. Yet West Ham held firm. Sent on to provide more energy during the dying stages, Fornals did more than that. Deep into added time a loose ball broke to the Spaniard, he drove a low shot past Ryan from 20 yards and West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s celebrations could begin."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/18/uk-will-lead-on-guard-rails-to-limit-dangers-of-ai-says-rishi-sunak", "primaryCategory": "technology", "title": "UK will lead on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcguard rails\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to limit dangers of AI, says Rishi Sunak", "lead": "PM sounds a more cautious note after calls from tech experts and business leaders for moratorium", "author": "Rowena Mason in Hiroshima", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T21:00:09Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036332", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/773e528a2c0074b4b8038a75a557ef34a3978a89/924_458_1340_804/500.jpg", "body": "The UK will lead on limiting the dangers of artificial intelligence, Rishi Sunak has said, after calls from some tech experts and business leaders for a moratorium. Sunak said AI could bring benefits and prove transformative for society, but it had to be introduced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safely and securely with guard rails in place\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments sound a more cautious approach than in the past, after tech leaders including Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, Elon Musk, and Apple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-founder Steve Wozniak added their names to nearly 30,000 signatures on a letter urging a pause in significant projects. The letter called for a moratorium while the capabilities and dangers of systems such as ChatGPT-4 are properly studied and mitigated in response to fears about the creation of digital minds, fraud, disinformation and the risk to jobs. Sunak has been an advocate of AI, emphasising its benefits rather than risks, and in March the government unveiled a light-touch regulatory programme that did not appear to include proposals for any new laws or enforcement bodies. He also launched a \u00c2\u00a3100m UK taskforce last month to develop \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe and reliable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd applications for AI with the aim of making the country a science and technology superpower by 2030. But, speaking on the plane to Japan for the G7 summit, where AI will be discussed, Sunak said a global approach to regulation was needed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have taken a deliberately iterative approach because the technology is evolving quickly and we want to make sure that our regulation can evolve as it does as well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now that is going to involve coordination with our allies \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you would expect it to form some of the conversations as well at the G7. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think that the UK has a track record of being in a leadership position and bringing people together, particularly in regard to technological regulation in the online safety bill \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 And again, the companies themselves, in that instance as well, have worked with us and looked to us to provide those guard rails as they will do and have done on AI.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US has also pushed for a discussion of AI at the summit in Hiroshima, with leaders potentially discussing the threat from disinformation or to infrastructure posed by a technology moving at speed, exemplified by the ChatGPT system. No 10 has indicated that it does not think a moratorium is the answer, but it is moving towards thinking about a global framework. The UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said earlier this month it would look at the underlying systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or foundation models \u00e2\u20ac\u201c behind AI tools. The initial review, described by one legal expert as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pre-warning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the sector, will publish its findings in September. Geoffrey Hinton, known as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153godfather of AI\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, announced he had quit Google earlier this month in order to speak more freely about the technology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dangers, and the UK government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outgoing chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has urged ministers to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get ahead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the profound social and economic changes that AI could trigger, saying the impact on jobs could be as big as that of the Industrial Revolution."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/may/18/newcastle-v-brighton-premier-league-live", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Newcastle 4-1 Brighton: Premier League \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "Newcastle are three points away from securing a Champions League spot after brushing aside Brighton", "author": "Will Unwin", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T20:52:09Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036334", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d91665b6975f915913f1f7627ba30219812c1377/169_28_3007_1804/500.jpg", "body": "Thank you very much for joining me. Here is Louise Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from St James\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Park. Howe: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to very quickly, mentally, move on to the match on Monday against Leicester. We were oustanding tonight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think that is us at our first in that first period. Full credit to the players for what they gave physically. When Brighton scored it made things difficult for us but I think we were mature.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trippier: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a massive win. We knew we needed to get the three points. We wanted to start fast and be clinical. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shown togetherness and handled the pressure well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Burn: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Credit to the lads, we stuck at it and especially Cal at the end. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been so consistent all season but might have come off of that in the past couple of weeks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always wanted to get a Premier League goal for Newcastle. It feels amazing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sheffield Wednesday are 3-0 up against Peterborough \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only need one more goal. Enciso and Almiron are making up after their little disagreement during the match. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a relief for the nation of Paraguay. It was a funny old game. Newcastle were very dominant but almost let Brighton back into the match. In the end Howe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side got what they deserved thanks to some fine finishing in the second half. Three more points on Monday night against Leicester will confirm Newcastle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spot in the Champions League for next season. 90+6 mins: Striker! 90+5 mins: Wilson breaks free of the Brighton defence after the visitors are dispossessed due to some awful passing. The striker is through on goal but Steele is equal to the shot. More subs \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Joelinton and Trippier off, Targett and Manquillo on. 90+3 mins: In case you were wondering, eight minutes have been added on. Isak and Almiron off, Gordon and Saint-Maximin on. The Brazilian fires home from 12 yards after fine work from Wilson inside the box. Almiron sends the ball through for Wilson to latch onto. He dribbles the ball 40 yards towards Steele and maintains composure to sidefoot home. 88 mins: Estupinan earns a corner off Trippier. The full back sends in the corner but the ball is cleared by a Newcastle head. Brighton come back at Newcastle but Enciso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cross is straight at Pope. 86 mins: St James\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Park seems to be a touch anxious at the moment. 84 mins: Brighton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final change sees Undav replaced by Peupion for his Premier League debut. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 20-year-old Australian midfielder, in case you were wondering. 82 mins: Almiron and Enciso have a bit of a shouting match and a push. Lively from the Paraguayans. 80 mins: Isak lays the ball back to Guimares, who fires over from the edge of the box. The referee then takes his time to book Van Hecke for a ludicrous lunge on Anderson. 78 mins: Brighton are certainly looking the livelier side going into the final stages. 76 mins: Howe uses the break in play to speak to his players. Van Hecke misses the chance to attempt a pass to find Estupinan running through down the middle. Oh well. 74 mins: Enciso dribbles through the Newcastle midfield but his pass out to Mitoma is wayward. The Japan international just keeps it in play but Brighton lose momentum. Joelinton is on the deck again. He seem to have an issue with his ankle/heel. 72 mins: Caicedo fouls Guimaraes but it is the Brighton man that ends up on the deck in pain. After a bit of moaning, he gets up. 70 mins: Caicedo gets down the right and whips in a cross towards the penalty spot where Enciso is waiting to flick at goal but he flashes his header wide. Offiah is on for Gross, sending Caicedo into central midfield. This is only Offiah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second Premier League appearance. Yes, he is related to Martin. 68 mins: Newcastle seem to be slowing down the play here. It could be part of a cunning plan \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 66 mins: Trippier lifts a free-kick into the box and Newcastle claim a foul for a shirt pull but the referee isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t having it. The excitement does not end there because the ball is crossed back in to Isak, who heads at goal, forcing Steele into a fine save, low to his right. Newcastle recycle the ball and Brighton are forced to clear it off the line. 64 mins: Mac Allister battles with Wilson in the centre circle but cannot deal with the striker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strength and gives him a little kick to earn a booking. 62 mins: Joelinton is lying on the ground after challenging Van Hecke. He seems to have a head injury but should be fine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153C\u00e2\u20ac\u2122mon Brighton!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd screams Rich Cutler. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I reckon we can pull two goals back, at least! \"Mind you, I thought we could pull three (four? I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember...) back in the second half against Everton... Ah well. Gotta take it as it comes... \u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 60 mins: Brighton open up Newcastle, getting the ball to Undav on the edge of the box. He has two decent options: to shoot or lay it to Mac Allister on the right. Instead he looks to Mitoma to the left and gives away possession. Anderson is coming on for Willock, who looks to have knacked his hamstring. 58 mins: Gross goes into the book for a late challenge on Joelinton. The free-kick is in a fine position for Trippier to whip in another set-piece. The cross reaches Burn at the back post, from where he heads the ball back across goal but Brighton have the numbers in place to clear. 56 mins: Triple change for Brighton \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Enciso, Ferguson and Mac Allister on \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Gilmour, Welbeck and Buonanotte off. 54 mins: Well this has spiced things up. Brighton have not been part of the conversation in this match but are now only a goal behind. Will Newcastle get nervous? 52 mins: Newcastle almost restore their two-goal lead immediately. The ball is sent down the right to Almiron, he lifts his head up to find Wilson but the striker cannot control his volley. It is all very easy for Brighton as a through ball dissects the Newcastle defence, allowing Undav to run onto it and slide a shot under Pope. 51 mins: Almost three! A cross is flicked to the back post by Isak to Almiron who volleys at goal but Steele is there to block it. 49 mins: A pass is fired into Wilson, who takes a poor touch, allowing Dunk to get back and take the ball. 47 mins: Brighton have kept the same 11 on the pitch. Will they be able to turn it around? The early stages indicate not. Newcastle on top once more. Here we go again! Speaking of teams being 2-0 up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Sheffield Wednesday are leading Peterborough by that scoreline. They only need tow more to get it to extra time! Brighton have not been in this match at all. Mac Allister and Enciso on at the break in a desperate attempt to turn things around? The hosts fully deserve their lead after a dominant first half which Brighton have struggled to compete in. The Seagulls have looked very disjointed after making changes in the aftermath of beating Arsenal. Another fine delivery from Trippier is powered home by Burn after he gets away from his marker. 45+3 mins: Schar is booked for hitting Gilmour in the face. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s getting quite spicy. 45+2 mins: Undav dives in from behind on Willock just outside the box and is rightly booked for his stupidity. Meanwhile, Joelinton is fuming with Caicedo for blocking his path and causing him pain. The Brazilian needs to calm down. 45 mins: Two minutes added on. 44 mins: Gilmour lifts a ball to Buonanotte on the left flank. The teenager wags his finger at the assistant when the flag is hoisted to indicate offside. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine gesture but undermined by the fact he is about four yards off. 42 mins: Brighton break on Newcastle but it breaks down on the left when Mitoma is crowded out. 40 mins: Brighton give a free-kick away on the left, allowing Trippier to whip in another dangerous set-piece. He curls it towards the goalkeeper but the referee blows up for a free-kick for a foul on Van Hecke. Brighton seem to feel guilty about this, so do some awful passing within their own area. Steele plays it to Gross facing his own goal and Joelinton dispossess him but the Seagulls just about recover to avoid conceding. 38 mins: After almost no involved thus far, Mitoma does something. He collects the ball in the left and flashes a rises shot wide. 36 mins: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Liverpool fan in me is really hoping Guimaraes gets another yellow. Just saying,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd just says Joe Pearson. 34 mins: Another Trippier corner causes problems inside the box. Brighton scrap to get it out but the ball comes straight back; Burn controls it and spins but a deflection sends his shot wide. 32 mins: Almiron sprints down the left with the ball at his feet. He feeds it to Schar inside the box, from where he flashes it across goal but there is no one there to knock into the empty net. Prolific from Brighton. 30 mins: Estupinan loses the ball to Almiron (again). The Paraguayan bursts into the box with the left-back chasing him. Almiron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shot is blocked and Wilson picks it up but immediately goes down in the vicinity of Dunk. It looks like a dive and VAR accept it is not a foul. Guimaraes goes into the book for a foul on Mitoma and then moans to the referee about it. 28 mins: Brighton have not bounced back from the goal. Newcastle still in the ascendency. 26 mins: De Zerbi is patrolling the technical area in the desperate hope he can get a simple message of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to his players. 24 mins: A goal is what Newcastle have deserved and it has re-energised the crowd. Brighton really need to up their game. I suspect Mac Allister will be brought on early if things carry on like this. Trippier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corner is headed into his own net by Undav. 22 mins: It is all Newcastle still but they have not found that perfect chance yet despite their dominance. The only Brighton players to touch the ball are the goalkeeper and centre-backs. Joelinton slips into space inside the box and spins to shoot but Dunk is there to block the goalbound shot. 20 mins: Schar has been given a bloody nose and is off while someone sticks a bit of tissue up there to solve the problem. Trippier whips in a corner from the left which Steele flaps at with such incompetence that he misses the ball and earns a goal-kick. 18 mins: Caicedo commits a foul throw. That should drop his value by about \u00c2\u00a320m. 16 mins: Brighton love playing with fire. Steele just about gets away with a Cruyff turn inside his own box with Almiron putting him under pressure. Down the other end \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Welbeck takes aim from 25 yards but it does not trouble Pope. 14 mins: Estupinan loses the ball on the left, allowing Almiron to pick it up and attack down the left. The Paraguayan cuts in and plays a one-two with Wilson before wafting a tired shot wide. 12 mins: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to draw attention away from Tyneside,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Bill Preston, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be an absolute corker of a game in fewer than twenty (count \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem) minutes as Sheffield Wednesday get a colossal stomp at home on to overturn a four (count \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcem) goal deficit against Peterborough and progress to the League One play off finals after a season of thrilling heroics and run on sentences. Have a great one!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It would be one of the great turnarounds \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 10 mins: Schar whacks a free-kick from 30 yards but it is straight at Steele. It is all Newcastle here. Speaking of which \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Almiron gets to the byline and pings a pull-back to Willock but he cannot control his shot and it flashes wide. 8 mins: Brighton pass it around the back for a few seconds and then Dunk to whacks it straight up the pitch to no man. It leads to a Newcastle attack with Isak getting down the left, he crosses the ball into the six-yard box and hits Steele in the legs. The danger is not cleared because the ball ricochets off a defender and needs to be cleared off the line. 6 mins: A first sight of goal for Newcastle and Isak. The Swede cuts in from the left and rattles off a shot but it flies well wide of the goal. There is another chance soon after when the ball lands at Almiron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feet in the box but it is well blocked by Van Hecke. 4 mins: All pretty quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the pitch and in the stands - in the opening stages. 2 mins: Caicedo is starting at right-back for Brighton once more. Gross is in midfield. Undav tries a shot from about 25 yards but it is blocked. Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go! Chris Paraskevas is eager: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153G\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Day Will! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 04:30 local kick-off here. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just ducked outside for a quick pre-game durry, only to find the resident neighbourhood cat staring into my soul - can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a good sign. Gone are the days when Brighton were just a throaway line in an overly-dramatized movie about Brian Clough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life. I genuinely fear they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to do a number on us. Better get back to my coffee...the cat is at the door waiting for its daily milk hit. HTL!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You will learn nothing here. Peter Oh is all about pedigree: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brighton defender Jan Paul van Hecke is the nephew of former Dutch international and erstwhile Southampton manager Jan Poortvliet, who started for the Netherlands in that epic World Cup Final in 1978 against Argentina. Pedigree!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Will Brighton lose Caicedo and Mac Allister this summer? Almost certainly but they will get a load of cash for them. Eddie Howe: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel the players have prepared well, they are in a good place, they know what they need to do. It is up to us to deliver. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We believe in the players and how we play. With the spirit of the crowd, hopefully we can play well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Premier League on a Thursday night is discombobulating. I struggle to know which night of the week it is regardless and this is not helping. Brighton have a very jazzy kit colour. Former Middlesbrough goalkeeper Jason Steele starts for Brighton. He will be aiming to help cause an upset. He has been incredibly impressive since taking over as No 1 from Robert Sanchez after waiting a long time for his chance. Welcome to all our readers in Paraguay where this game is massive. Admittedly, Enciso is on the bench. Get in the mood for the match with some pure Gazza. Newcastle have named teenage midfielder Lewis Miley on the bench after withdrawing him from England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s squad for the Under-17 European Championships.

They continue their quest for Europe tonight at Newcastle, who have more than a little interest in playing continental football next season. A win tonight for Eddie Howe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s men would put a Champions League spot within touching distance. Newcastle have enjoyed a fantastic season and it would be a fine ending to win at St James\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Park tonight and against Leicester on Monday to seal their return to Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top table. Robert De Zerbi will not make things easy for them and come into this off the back of all-but-ending Arsenal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s title hopes at the weekend. That victory at the Emirates should see the title race over by Sunday night, meaning City could be a more agreeable proposition next Thursday at the Amex, giving Brighton great hope of securing sixth. Anyway \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope for a cracker from two in-form teams.

The celebrations could well begin on Monday night when Leicester travel here but, should Aston Villa triumph at Liverpool, might be triggered as early as Saturday. On this evidence though, a few of Eddie Howe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s players could be almost too tired to party. The indefatigable Lewis Dunk and Jason Steele excepted, much the same could be said of Roberto De Zerbi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidently fatigued team as they aim to take Brighton into Europe for the first time. While Newcastle pushed themselves defiantly, and often magnificently, through the pain barrier, De Zerbi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side were way below their mesmeric best and never looked like sustaining a brief second-half revival. The usually influential Mois\u00c3\u00a9s Caicedo and Pascal Gross were particularly poor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how we want to play, fast and with high intensity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Howe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a brilliant performance, especially out of possession. But maintaining that sort of rhythm throughout is not easy and involves taking risks. When Brighton scored they made it a bit nervy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Newcastle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager refuses to discuss securing a top-four finish just yet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I actually can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pronounce the CL words at the moment, they go funny against my lips,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd joked Howe, whose side visit Chelsea on Sunday week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nothing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been achieved. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re close but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still so far away. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve tried not to talk about it in meetings. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take anything for granted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Evidently heeding Howe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s instruction to remind everyone they remain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a force\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Newcastle began with a zeal that soon had De Zerbi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side penned into their own half, gasping for breath. Brighton looked a barely detectable shadow of the team which had won 3-0 at Arsenal last Sunday. As Joe Willock, Joelinton, Alexander Isak, Miguel Almir\u00c3\u00b3n and company forced their guests into a series of errors, rarely permitting them to hold onto the ball for more than a matter of seconds, it seemed a repeat of the visitors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 5-1 home surrender to Everton earlier this month was a real possibility. Only Dunk, fighting a valiant rearguard effort at centre-half, and Steele, demonstrating why he has displaced Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Robert S\u00c3\u00a1nchez in goal, mounted a significant resistance effort. Shortly after Dunk had performed heroics to block Joelinton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shot, Brighton finally fell behind. The goal came from a corner, expertly whipped in by Kieran Trippier and headed into his own net by the helpless Deniz Undav. S\u00c3\u00a1nchez, left at home on the south coast after exhibiting a marked reluctance to sit on the bench, may have felt that, in throwing his toys out of his pram, he had made the right decision.If Steele looked suitably relieved when VAR officials confirmed that Dunk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge on Callum Wilson should not lead to a penalty, S\u00c3\u00a1nchez\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s replacement was powerless to prevent Newcastle doubling their advantage on the verge of half-time. Once again it was created by the excellent Trippier, whose latest free-kick was headed beyond Steele by Dan Burn. It dictated that Howe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal interval concerns centred on the yellow cards collected by his key central midfielder, Bruno Guimar\u00c3\u00a3es, for a foul on Kaoru Mitoma, and Fabian Sch\u00c3\u00a4r, for shoving Billy Gilmour in the face. Burn re-emerged for the second period seeming somehow larger than his customary 6ft 7in. Not only had he scored his first Premier League goal for Newcastle, it had arrived against his former employers. Who would have thought there was a time on the south coast when the defender could barely get a game for Brighton? Unfortunately for Howe, Burn was soon brought back down to earth when De Zerbi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side stunned St James\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Park by, albeit temporarily, remembering that they can play a bit after all. No sooner had Burn crossed, Willock flicked on and Almir\u00c3\u00b3n forced Steele into a stellar save, than Gilmour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s superior through pass precipitated the advancing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and by now much-improved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Undav expertly steering his shot beneath the diving Nick Pope. With that goal having rightly survived a VAR review for a potential offside, De Zerbi opted to further spice things up courtesy of a triple substitution, involving the introduction of Argentina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alexis Mac Allister. Willock has realistic ambitions to win an England cap but they were almost certainly placed on hold when he collapsed with what appeared a serious hamstring injury. Worryingly for Howe, Willock appeared in considerable pain as he was helped off the pitch and replaced by Elliot Anderson. With Sean Longstaff sidelined by an ankle problem and Joelinton collecting a knock here, Newcastle looked somewhat understaffed in that department right now. At least Wilson remains in good health. In the dying minutes the England striker scored his 18th goal of the season, and 11th since the start of April, meeting Almir\u00c3\u00b3n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pass and advancing 40 yards before side\u00e2\u20ac\u2018footing home. Then Wilson held the ball up adroitly for Guimar\u00c3\u00a3es to apply an ecstatically received 12-yard finish. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was difficult, very tough,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said De Zerbi. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Newcastle were stronger. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play well and deserved to lose.

The marchers, mostly male Orthodox teens and young men, were celebrating Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capture of East Jerusalem in 1967. The crowd waved blue and white Israeli flags and chanted slogans such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Death to Arabs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will burn your village\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Authorities barred Palestinians from going through most of the gates into the Old City. One group of marchers threw rocks and bottles at members of the press covering the event, wounding three journalists, including a Palestinian reporter for Haaretz, who was struck in the neck, the paper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website reported.

Ibrahim Hamad, 28, a Palestinian freelance journalist who was covering events at Damascus Gate, said the attack was unprovoked. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were standing here as journalists and there were also some women wearing hijabs near us. Groups of extremist Zionists started throwing glass bottles and sticks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe they were trying to stop us from showing what they are doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Palestinian community leader Fakhri Abu Diab was outside al-Aqsa mosque giving a telephone interview with Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ynet news when four police officers approached him.

He was then forced out of the mosque compound, held at a street corner for an hour and a half, and told not to return to the Old City. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the Israeli police. We are facing apartheid,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said.

Some Democrats aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so sure. In the Senate, 11 lawmakers say Joe Biden should consider invoking the constitution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14th amendment to prevent a default, rather than agreeing to GOP-devised spending cuts. And in the House, just about every Democrat has signed on to a discharge petition that would force a vote on raising the ceiling without preconditions. But it needs the defections of at least a few Republicans to succeed, and thus far, that support has not emerged. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what else happened today: Ron DeSantis is finally getting it over with: the Florida governor will announce his presidential bid next week, according to multiple reports. Progressive Democrats remain displeased with the prospect of implementing new work requirements for government aid programs as part of a debt limit deal. CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christiane Amanpour was not happy with how her network handled the town hall with Donald Trump last week. California Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health may be worse than publicly known, the New York Times reports. The House Freedom Caucus says no negotiations with Democrats until the Senate passes the GOP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bill to raise the debt ceiling while cutting spending and implementing a number of conservative policies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nonstarter for Democrats. As Florida governor Ron DeSantis prepares to announce a presidential campaign where he will sell voters on his controversial governance of the southern state, Disney today announced they were cancelling a billion-dollar office project in Orlando amid a fight with his administration. According to the New York Times, a top Disney executive cited \u00e2\u20ac\u0153changing business conditions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for axing the project, which would have seen about 1,000 employees relocated from Southern California. The company has been feuding with DeSantis since last year, when it spoke out against his so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Say Gay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd law, and last month sued his administration over actions they said illegally targeted their business in the state. That matter is ongoing, but as the Times reports, Disney executives have made clear that they are willing to reconsider their longstanding relationship with the state over DeSantis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from the Times: In March, Disney called Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his scorched-earth attempt to tighten oversight of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme park resort near Orlando. Last month, when Disney sued the governor and his allies for what it called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a targeted campaign of government retaliation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the company made clear that $17 billion in planned investment in Walt Disney World was on the line. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Does the state want us to invest more, employ more people, and pay more taxes, or not?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robert A. Iger, Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, said on an earnings-related conference call with analysts last week. On Thursday, Mr. Iger and Josh D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Amaro, Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theme park and consumer products chairman, showed that they were not bluffing, pulling the plug on a nearly $1 billion office complex that was scheduled for construction in Orlando. It would have brought more than 2,000 jobs to the region, with $120,000 as the average salary, according to an estimate from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. The project, known as the Lake Nona Town Center, was supposed to involve the relocation of more than 1,000 employees from Southern California, including most of a department known as Imagineering, which works with Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s movie studios to develop theme park attractions. Most of the affected employees complained bitterly about having to move \u00e2\u20ac\u201d some quit \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but Disney largely held firm, partly because of a Florida tax credit that would have allowed the company to recoup as much as $570 million over 20 years for building and occupying the complex. Another group of conservative lawmakers has issued demands in the ongoing debt ceiling negotiations, specifically that congressional leaders include new measures to crack on migrants in whatever legislative compromise emerges. The letter to Joe Biden and the top Democrats and Republicans in Congress including Kevin McCarthy was signed by 57 Republican House lawmakers, and asks that they consider including provisions of the Secure the Border Act in their negotiations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for the rapidly growing illegal immigration crisis. Thus, we support the inclusion of common-sense border security and immigration reforms in negotiations to raise the debt ceiling,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the congress members write. The bill, which passed with Republican votes in the House last month, would restart construction of Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s border wall and increase Border Patrol funding, among other provisions. As is the case with much of what passes the House these days, Senate Democrats say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll oppose it. The far-right House Freedom Caucus wants Kevin McCarthy to stop negotiating with Democrats over raising the debt ceiling until the Senate passes the GOP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Limit, Save, Grow Act. The legislation, which would cut spending, scrap Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s student loan forgiveness plan and implement other conservative priorities while raising the debt limit only through next March, passed the House on a party line vote last month, but Senate Democrats have rejected it and the president has threatened a veto. The impasse led to this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by McCarthy and Biden to appoint negotiators to find an agreement both parties could support, but the Freedom Caucus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which includes several members that objected to McCarthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election as speaker of the House earlier this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c insists the Limit, Save, Grow Act should take priority. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s their letter: Amid continued focus on the health of the California senator Dianne Feinstein, who recently returned to Washington after a long absence with shingles, the New York Times reports that the 89-year-old, who has appeared frail and sometimes confused, continues to be the cause of much concern for her party: The grim tableau of her re-emergence on Capitol Hill laid bare a bleak reality known to virtually everyone who has come into contact with her in recent days: She was far from ready to return to work when she did, and she is now struggling to function in a job that demands long days, near-constant engagement on an array of crucial policy issues and high-stakes decision-making. Ms Feinstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office declined to comment for this article beyond providing a statement from the senator: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m back in Washington, voting and attending committee meetings while I recover from complications related to a shingles diagnosis. I continue to work and get results for California.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Times also notes the resurfacing of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153questions about whether Ms Feinstein, who has announced she will retire when her term ends next year, is fit to continue serving even for that long\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Feinstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absence hamstrung Democrats on the Senate judiciary committee, on which she sits. On Wednesday its chair, Dick Durbin, told CNN: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re happy to have her back. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re monitoring her medical condition almost on a daily basis. Our staff is in touch with her staff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Senior Democrats including the former House intelligence chair and impeachment lead Adam Schiff are running to succeed Feinstein but, the Times report says somewhat mordantly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People close to her joke privately that perhaps when Ms Feinstein is dead, she will start to consider resigning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, from Arwa Mahdawi\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 At his press conference on Capitol Hill, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was asked by a reporter about concerns that his proposal to invoke the 14th amendment to address the debt ceiling would face legal challenges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best solution we have,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sanders replied. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not perfect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sanders said he did not have any details about a potential debt ceiling deal between Joe Biden and House speaker Kevin McCarthy, but Democrats emphasized that any proposal with welfare cuts would not be tolerated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the bottom line is that the only deal to be had that McCarthy will sign on to is one in which ordinary families are savaged and in which the economy is flooded with fossil fuels, that is unacceptable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon. Asked if he had spoken to the White House about his proposal to use the 14th amendment, Sanders said he had but declined to elaborate. Eleven Democratic senators have signed a letter calling on Joe Biden to invoke the 14th amendment of the constitution to address the debt ceiling and avoid a disastrous default. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and his co-signers held a press conference on Capitol Hill to make their case. Sanders noted the 14th amendment states that the public debt of the United States \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shall not be questioned,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd arguing the policy empowers Biden to unilaterally act on the debt ceiling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Republicans] have made it clear that they are prepared to hold our entire economy hostage unless the president gives in to all of their demands,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sanders said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Using the 14th amendment would allow the United States to continue to pay its bills on time and without delay, prevent an economic catastrophe and prevent devastating cuts to some of the most vulnerable people in this country. It should be exercised.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Debt ceiling negotiations seem to be on track, at least if you ask Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy. Some Democrats aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so sure. In the Senate, 11 lawmakers say Joe Biden should consider invoking the constitution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 14th amendment to prevent a default, rather than agreeing to GOP-devised spending cuts. And in the House, just about every Democrat has signed on to a discharge petition that would force a vote on raising the ceiling without preconditions. But it needs the defections of at least a few Republicans to succeed, and thus far, that support has not emerged. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what else has happened today so far: Ron DeSantis is finally getting it over with: the Florida governor will announce his presidential bid next week, according to multiple reports. Progressive Democrats remain unhappy with the prospect of implementing new work requirements for government aid programs as part of a debt limit deal. CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Christiane Amanpour was not happy with how her network handled the town hall with Donald Trump last week. Meanwhile in the House, Democrats are pushing forward with a parliamentary maneuver intended to force a vote on raising the debt ceiling without preconditions. The party had yesterday encouraged its lawmakers to sign a discharge petition filed in the chamber, and in an interview with MSNBC yesterday, House Democrat Brendan Boyle, who is leading the effort, said the document has so far received 210 signatures. It needs a majority of 218 signers to pass, and what Democrats are banking on here is that some Republicans will eventually come on board, perhaps moderates who are nervous about the prospect of the US economy defaulting, or rattled by the demands of the House GOP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far-right members. But there hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been any sign of those defections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from Boyle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview with MSNBC: Eleven Democratic senators have signed a letter to Joe Biden urging him to consider invoking the 14th amendment to prevent the United States from defaulting if the debt ceiling is not raised. The letter, which first became public yesterday, was signed by Democrats Tina Smith, Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley, Ed Markey, Mazie Hirono, Peter Welch, Richard Blumenthal, Jack Reed, Sheldon Whitehouse, John Fetterman and Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The choice we face is clear. We cannot reach a budget agreement that increases the suffering of millions of Americans who are already living in desperation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the lawmakers write in the letter, which accuses Republicans of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not acting in good faith\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We write to urgently request that you prepare to exercise your authority under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, which clearly states: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe validity of the public debt of the United States ... shall not be questioned,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the signatories conclude. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Using this authority would allow the United States to continue to pay its bills on-time, without delay, preventing a global economic catastrophe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking of CNN, one of its best known anchors is apparently not a fan of how it handled last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s town hall with Donald Trump, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gloria Oladipo reports: The CNN anchor Christiane Amanpour has strongly criticized her own network for hosting a town-hall event with Donald Trump last week, saying she had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very robust exchange of views\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Chris Licht, the chief executive under fire for approving and then defending the decision to stage it. Amanpour, giving the commencement address at Columbia Journalism School in New York on Wednesday, said in comments reported by Variety: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know Trump and his tendencies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c everyone does. He just seizes the stage and dominates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No matter how much flak the moderator tries to aim at the incoming, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t often work. I would have dropped the mic at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnasty person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, but then that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If Democrats and Republicans are indeed on the path to reaching an agreement to increase the debt ceiling, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to overcome the thorny issue of work requirements for anti-poverty programs. The GOP wants to tighten rules for recipients of aid such as SNAP or TANF to have to work, arguing that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best way out of poverty. A major government study released last year disputed this, while many Democrats, particularly progressives, say such requirements would be unacceptable to them. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s House Democrat Katie Porter saying so, in an interview with CNN: The Republican House speake,r Kevin McCarthy, told reporters at the Capitol that he sees \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the path\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd towards a deal with Democrats to raise the debt ceiling. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s video of the exchange, from CNN: Congress has till about 1 June to raise the US government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal limit on how much debt it can take on or face the prospect of a default. Republicans want Joe Biden and his allies to agree to cut spending, and also to scrap administration priorities such as the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to cancel some federal student debt. After months of refusing to negotiate, Biden agreed to appoint deputies to reach a deal with McCarthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team, and if the speaker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments are any indication, those talks are paying off. Ron DeSantis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attempts to swing elections may have floundered, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been more successful at getting lawmakers in Florida to react to his demands. As the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sam Levine reported earlier this week, his Republican allies, who control both the state Senate and House of Representatives, have approved laws that will allow DeSantis to remain governor while running for president, and also reduce scrutiny of his campaign financing. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from Sam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story: DeSantis is poised to sign a bill that would exempt him from Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resign-to-run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd law, so that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to give up his office in order to run for president. Under existing state law, if he were to run, DeSantis would have had to submit a resignation letter before Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s qualifying deadline this year and step down by inauguration day in 2025. Last month, Republicans in the state legislature passed a measure that says the restriction does not apply to those running for president or vice-president. The bill also imposes sweeping new voting restrictions in the state and will make it much harder for non-profits to do voter registration drives. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of a better training ground than the state of Florida for a future potential commander-in-chief,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tyler Sirois, a Republican state lawmaker, said when the bill was being debated. Some Democrats questioned why lawmakers would allow DeSantis to take his attention away from being governor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why are we signing off on allowing Ron DeSantis the ability to not do his job?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Angie Nixon, a legislator from Jacksonville, said last month. DeSantis also signed a bill last week that will shield records related to his travel from public view. The new law exempts all of DeSantis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past and future travel from disclosure under Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public records law, one of the most transparent in the US. It also exempts the state from having to disclose the names of people who meet with the governor at his office or mansion or travel with him, said Barbara Petersen, the executive director of the Florida Center for Government Accountability, who has worked on transparency laws for more than three decades in the state. Republican lawmakers and DeSantis have cited security concerns to justify the law. But Democrats and transparency advocates have said it is a brazen effort to keep DeSantis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s travel secret. As Ron DeSantis gears up for a likely presidential bid, the rightwing Florida governor has suffered a few political blows in recent days in his state and beyond. On Tuesday, voters in Jacksonville, Florida elected their first female mayor, Donna Deegan, a Democrat who beat Republican Daniel Davis despite the endorsements of DeSantis and a handful of business leaders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Love won tonight, and we made history,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deegan said as she won the election. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a new day in Jacksonville because people chose unity over division \u00e2\u20ac\u201c creating a broad coalition of people across the political spectrum that want a unified city,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added. Meanwhile, in Kentucky, the Florida governor suffered another blow when Donald Trump-backed Daniel Cameron won against DeSantis-backed Kelly Craft in the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican primary. Cameron, the first major-party Black nominee for governor in Kentucky, will face off against Democratic incumbent Andy Beshear in November. Marjorie Taylor Greene has said that being called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153white supremacist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by New York representative Jamaal Bowman is equivalent to a person of color being called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153N-word.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On Wednesday, Greene and Bowman got into a shouting match on the Capitol steps with Bowman and New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both Democrats who called for Republican New York representative George Santos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation following his recent indictment on federal charges of wire fraud and money laundering, among other charges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Save the party!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bowman yelled as Greene shouted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Save the country!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At one point, Bowman told Greene, who has spread various conspiracy theories, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No more QAnon, no more MAGA, no more debt ceiling nonsense.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Minutes after, Greene pointed to her temple and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hey let me tell you something Jamaal. Not very smart.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Addressing the interaction afterwards, Greene said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was swarmed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all on video. Everyone can see this, but I will tell you what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on video is Jamaal Bowman shouting at the top of his lungs, cursing calling me \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 horrible \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 calling me a white supremacist, which I take great offense to. That is like calling a person of color the n-word, which should never happen. Calling me a white supremacist is equal to that. And that is wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Banking regulators testifying before the Senate banking committee on Thursday morning proposed a slew of recommendations that would strengthen regulation and supervision in light of Signature Bank and Silicone Valley Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial collapse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The underlying issue was concern about insolvency \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Stronger capital will guard against the risk that we may not fully appreciate today. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll also reduce the costs of bank failures,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Michael Barr, the second vice chair of the Federal Reserve for supervision. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition, we need to reconsider our prudential requirements. These include evaluating how we treat available for sale securities and our capital regulations, how we supervise and regulate a bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management of interest rate risk, how we supervise and regulate liquidity risk and how we oversee incentive compensation practices,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supervision should intensify at the right pace as a bank grows in size or complexity. Once identified issues should be addressed more quickly both by the bank and by supervisors. Moreover, we need to ensure that we have a culture that empowers supervisors to act in the face of uncertainty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he continued. Florida governor Ron DeSantis is set to officially launch his 2024 presidential bid, according to multiple reports citing sources familiar with the matter. One Republican source told CNN that the Republican governor will file candidacy paperwork next week with the Federal Election Commission and is set to make an official announcement in his home town of Dunedin, Florida, the following week. The reports follow DeSantis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Iowa last week where he participated in a public gathering hosted US House representative Randy Feenstra in the crucial early-voting stage. Prior to his visit, DeSantis rolled out a hefty list of endorsements from 37 Republican Iowa lawmakers, including senate president Amy Sinclair and house majority leader Matt Windschitl. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we need to restore sanity in this country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DeSantis told a crowd of Iowa supporters last week, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must reject the culture of losing that has impacted our party in recent years. The time for excuses is over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DeSantis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments appeared to be a subtle jab at Donald Trump, currently the Republican frontrunner who has repeatedly attacked his ex-ally and is currently leading in the polls. Should DeSantis enter the presidential race, he will become Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief challenger. In the past year, DeSantis has ramped up his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153culture war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Florida, from signing the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say gay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bill into law to approving abortion bans after six weeks. Most recently, the rightwing governor signed a bill on Monday that defunds diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public colleges. Florida governor Ron DeSantis is set to officially launch his 2024 presidential bid, according to multiple reports citing sources familiar with the matter. One Republican source told CNN that the Republican governor will file candidacy paperwork next week with the Federal Election Commission and is set to make an official announcement in his home town of Dunedin, Florida, the following week. Earlier this week, reports emerged that DeSantis is poised to sign a bill that would modify a Florida law and allow him to run for president while serving as governor. The bill is also expected to impose new voting restrictions across Florida and will make it increasingly difficult for non-profits to conduct voter registration drives. Last Saturday, DeSantis rolled out a hefty list of endorsements from Iowa lawmakers and visited the crucial early-voting state in an attempt to garner support for his likely bid. Here are other developments in US politics: Dianne Feinstein, the oldest serving senator, has prompted renewed scrutiny over her fitness to serve following her return to Capitol Hill after a months-long absence due to shingles. California representative Adam Schiff said he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not backing down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the face of a Republican-led effort to expel him from Congress. The Pentagon leaks suspect was warned repeatedly about his mishandling of classified material, according to prosecutors."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/18/ceramicist-eriko-inazaki-wins-the-loewe-foundation-craft-prize", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "title": "Ceramicist Eriko Inazaki wins the Loewe Foundation craft prize ", "lead": "In New York, author Fran Lebowitz presented the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50,000 award which champions crafts and celebrates their influence on fashion and design", "author": "Alice Fisher", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T19:41:28Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036355", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3f82b0c24c98ece0566d71a97a0866c76e5f2b80/0_0_2698_1620/500.jpg", "body": "Fran Lebowitz is on stage in the courtyard of New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Noguchi Museum, presenting the 2023 Loewe Foundation Craft Prize to Japanese ceramicist Eriko Inazaki. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just viewed the exhibition of work by the 30 finalists in the late sculptor Isamu Noguchi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal studio over the road. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my opinion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the writer tells the 500-strong crowd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what makes something craft instead of art comes down to whether something is useful or useless. Most of those things look pretty useless to me, which makes them art.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Inazaki cries as she accepts the prize, saying it feels like a dream she never expected to come true. Her artwork is called Metanoia, a ridiculously detailed object that looks like intricate coral or a grain of pollen under a microscope. The judges say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen anything like it. The exhibition for the prize is the first to be displayed in Noguchi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s studio, a mark of the respect with which the Loewe prize is regarded in the art world. The \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50,000 (\u00c2\u00a343,500) prize was inaugurated in 2016 by Jonathan Anderson, creative director of the Spanish fashion house Loewe. While its aim \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to champion expertise in the likes of basketry, metalwork, bookbinding and other crafts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might seem rather esoteric, but it turned out to be prescient. Since the prize was launched, Britain in particular has got hooked on craft. Textile and printmaker Anni Albers, ceramicist Lucie Rie and Faith Ringgold, an artist best known for her quilt making, have all had major British shows. Fashioning Masculinities: The Art of Menswear at the V&amp;A was the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most successful paid-for exhibition in 2022 according to the Art Newspaper. Strange Clay at the Hayward Gallery was the first major British art show to celebrate creatives working with clay. Craft has also become appointment viewing with TV shows such as The Great Pottery Throw Down The Great British Sewing Bee and The Repair Shop regularly pulling in 6 million viewers. More Britons are becoming professional makers too as lockdown knitters and potters stay loyal to their new crafts. Retailer Hobbycraft saw sales jump 14.8% in 2022 to \u00c2\u00a3203m. A Crafts Council survey found that, in 2020, sales of UK craft products topped \u00c2\u00a33bn, with the biggest demographic of buyers now aged 35 and under, showing a generational shift to a younger, more ethnically diverse crowd investing in craft. Anderson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award was partly inspired by his fashion hero, Japanese designer Issey Miyake, who promoted the work of pioneering potters like Lucie Rie and Jennifer Lee on his avant garde fashion platform. Anderson couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why most fashion labels align themselves with artists rather than championing the craft that lies at the core of much of their work. Fashion would be nothing without goldsmiths, leather workers and textiles, after all. Loewe was founded in 1846 by leather craftsmen so it seemed like a good fit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Craft has existed since the beginning of time; you could tell the history of civilisation through ceramics if you wanted to. There have always been vessels,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anderson says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Porcelain changed the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it helped cleanliness; medical devices were made from it. We as humans make things: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a second job, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an impulse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Working on the craft prize has shown Anderson how disparate the view of making and creating is in different cultures and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involved in a project to protect endangered crafts in the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are only two people left in Scotland who can make sporrans. That, to me, is as scary as a language disappearing. Through doing the craft prize and working with governments and councils, you find out which countries have focus on this and have invested. If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heroize these people, there won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be another generation to do it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a year of debate about AI and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re starting to realise that we want repetition of the same thing, reconfigured from what already exists. So if you think about that algorithm, and only using what is already there, you see we have to protect craft. You have to experiment with what exists to be able to progress.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anderson grew up in Northern Ireland. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s currently most famous for dressing Rihanna for her Super Bowl performance and pregnancy reveal, but his designs for his own brand and Loewe are revered in fashion circles. JW Anderson, his label, is the only one to ever win menswear and womenswear designer of the year at the British Fashion Awards. It was also one of the first to adopt the idea of non-binary clothing. His more recent JW Anderson collection, in February, was all about protest and punk. He used his post-show interviews to call on British fashion to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153step up and say something\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In Britain there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a history of thinking craft is about nostalgic rustics and an escape from the world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Deyan Sudjic, former director of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Design Museum and a member of the Loewe prize jury. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea of the sacredness of handcraft began with William Morris and we still have a suspicion that it is a retreat from the world.

During the press view he said he was honoured to be able to represent Africa at the award. There were five finalists from Korea and six from Japan.

Palin called his director, an Oxford classicist, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Professor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Viewers enjoyed the natural situations Palin found himself in, as he brought his humour, inquiring mind and sense of excitement to the places and challenges he experienced, as well as displaying the awkwardness of travellers confronted by new cultures and people. It began with Around the World in 80 Days (1989), which recreated the route of the fictional explorer Phileas Fogg in Jules Verne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19th-century novel of the same name. The idea came from Clem Vallance, who went on to produce the series, for which he and Mills directed different episodes. Although Palin was Vallance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferred choice as presenter from the start \u00e2\u20ac\u201c having been impressed by a 1980 programme he made about a train journey from London to the Kyle of Lochalsh in Scotland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Will Wyatt, the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of features and documentaries, proposed the seasoned TV traveller Alan Whicker. Mills had just spent months filming British expats in Australia for the 1988 Whicker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World series Living With Waltzing Matilda, but he and Vallance conspired to ensure Palin landed the job. At a lunch with Whicker, they decided to stress the discomforts and lack of five-star hotels, with Mills telling Whicker: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You will have to share deck space with the crew between Oman and Bombay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mills recalled: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He wrote a letter the next day to the effect that he thought the pace of the show would be such that he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to prepare his interviews.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Palin was confirmed as presenter and even consulted Whicker for some travel tips. As he circumnavigated the globe by land and sea via Venice, Athens, Egypt, Dubai, India, Hong Kong, China and the US, before sailing across the Atlantic back to Britain, he dubbed Mills, Vallance and the rest of the film crew Passepartout, after Fogg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French manservant and constant companion. In Bombay, Palin struggled with what he recorded in his diary as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grinding poverty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and children begging, adding; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wearing us all down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mills captured his uncomfortable response, verging on guilt, to such encounters. Viewers and critics agreed on the wisdom of having Palin front a travel programme, and more followed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with Mills again directing. Two further series completed what became known as a trilogy: Pole to Pole (1992), from north to south pole via Scandinavia, Russia, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus and Africa, providing greater physical challenges, and Full Circle (1997), a logistically complicated, anti-clockwise, 50,000-mile journey round the Pacific Rim that started in the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia. Mills also directed Palin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subsequent series, Sahara (2002), Himalaya (2004) and New Europe (2007), and was an executive producer of his 2012 Brazil adventure. He admitted making Palin suffer in front of viewers. When they were both interviewed by the Independent in 2014, Mills told Palin: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a Turkish bath or hammam that you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been slapped or walloped in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or any medicinal mud that you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been smeared with.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But he never asked Palin to do anything he would not do himself. Mills was also the editor of BBC Two\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 40 Minutes strand for its first four years (1981-85), overseeing a wide range of documentaries, encouraging young talent and winning Bafta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best factual series award twice. He was born in Anerley, south London, to Aileen (nee Rowe), a radio actor and dramatist, and Henry Mills, a history teacher. He attended Portsmouth grammar school after his father became head of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Southern grammar school for boys. Following national service in the Intelligence Corps, then at GCHQ, he studied classics at Worcester College, Oxford (1956-59), taught Latin and Greek at Felsted school, Essex, and then moved to Eastbourne college. Mills joined BBC South in 1962 as a television news reporter and later moved to BBC West. Nationally, he produced and directed documentaries such as The Mormon Invasion (1967), about missionaries of the American church recruiting members in Britain, and Expulsion (1971), about drug-taking in schools. In 1972, Mills became an executive producer of several groundbreaking fly-on-the wall series about institutions, including the Royal Navy in the award-winning Sailor (1976) and Radley college in Public School (1980). He regarded it as an achievement to get access to what he had seen as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd institutions. He was also the first executive producer of the investigative-journalism series Inside Story, from 1974 to 1980. As a director, Mills\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other documentaries included Return to Saigon and Return to Peking (both 1988), with the reporter Anthony Grey, and The Clintons: A Marriage of Power (1998) on Channel 4, for whom he also produced the series New Model Army (2000), about the military\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to stamp out racism. His contribution to factual television was recognised with Bafta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1981 Desmond Davis award. Mills\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marriage to Kathleen Hayward in 1962 ended in divorce. In 1989 he married Susie Mansell, and she survives him, along with their daughter, Hannah, the daughter of his first marriage, Sophie, and his granddaughter, Frances. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Roger Edwin Stuart Mills, producer and director, born 22 November 1936; died 5 May 2023"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/18/susan-drucker-brown-obituary", "primaryCategory": "science", "title": "Susan Drucker-Brown obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives:</strong> Anthropologist whose work proved influential in studies of West African kingship", "author": "Toby Brown", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T19:27:40Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036361", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a5e0048119ba42992a4683ac8a3028f1c1bd6360/0_358_1280_768/500.jpg", "body": "My mother, Susan Drucker-Brown, who has died aged 87, was a distinguished anthropologist whose warmth and humour lasted throughout her life. Susan began field research in Mexico \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in Jamiltepec, Oaxaca \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the early 1960s, after graduating from the National School of Anthropology and History in Mexico City. She learned the local language, Nahuatl, and studied the transition of villagers to Spanish-speaking Mexicans. Her work on changing clothing styles was the subject of an exhibition held last year in Oaxaca. In later life, given a guitar and some wine, Susan would sing songs about electrification in rural Mexico. From Mexico, in 1962 Susan went to Newnham College, Cambridge to study with Professor Meyer Fortes. Her anthropological focus shifted to northern Ghana, and she was awarded her PhD (1975) for her thesis on Ritual Aspects of Mamprusi Kingship, published by the university\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s African Studies Centre. Her ties to Ghana yielded many friendships and visits there with her work proving influential in studies of West African kingship. From 1980 to 2011 she was on the editorial board for Cambridge Anthropology and oversaw more than 70 issues. Susan was born in New York, in the Sunnyside neighbourhood of Queens. Her family came originally from Russia. Her father, David Drucker, was the first US-born family member. Her grandparents, Sarah and Nathan, fled the Russian anti-Jewish pogroms in the 1890s. Esther Milgram, her mother, came from Poland and it is from her that Susan inherited her musicality. David was a communist lawyer and in the early 1950s Susan experienced the anti-red and antisemitic currents that washed through the US. She recounted being abused and called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rosenberg\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (the name of the couple accused of being Soviet spies) on the subway as she travelled to her high school, New York Music and Art. In the era of McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee the family fled to Mexico City. Susan said her father once escaped the FBI by leaping over a hedge in the neighbourhood where they lived, near the artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo. FBI papers, released in 1983, show that the family was under surveillance until the late 1960s. In 1965, in Cambridge, Susan married Mick Brown, a Canadian physicist. Their children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my sisters Sarah and Isabel, and me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c grew up in a house full of debate, art and warmth. Our household welcomed family and friends from Mexico, Ghana, New York and Canada. Throughout her life Susan had mental health problems and would occasionally be hospitalised. She always retained her intellect and humour, from which her family benefited immensely. Her early training as an artist continued and she gained pleasure from studying at the Royal Drawing School in London. She exhibited paintings and etchings. In retirement Susan and Mick spent time in Snettisham, where Norfolk skies and local flora provided artistic inspiration as well as more opportunities for entertaining. She is survived by Mick and her children, and by six grandchildren, Isaac, Sabina, Elliot, Noah, Edith and Florence."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/18/alberic-fiennes-obituary", "primaryCategory": "society", "title": "Alberic Fiennes obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives:</strong> Pioneer in weight-loss surgery who argued that severe obesity is a disease requiring medical intervention and psychological support", "author": "Alice Fiennes", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T19:16:37Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036365", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4915b6d999518d143e989e8b4b626e482ca6e804/0_853_2848_1708/500.jpg", "body": "My father, Alberic Fiennes, who has died aged 75, was a pioneering surgeon.

From 1990 to 2007 he was a consultant surgeon and lecturer at St George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospital and medical school in Tooting, south London. He was committed to meticulous, patient-centric care and surgical innovation. An early convert to minimally invasive procedures that could reduce recovery time and pain, he was the first person in the UK to offer totally extraperitoneal (TEP) hernia repair as a day surgery. Alberic ultimately specialised in weight-loss surgery and in 2000 founded the current bariatric service at St George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospital. In this field he worked alongside his wife, Louise (nee Bidlake), a nurse. He regularly appeared on radio and television to argue that severe obesity is a devastating disease compounded by stigma, and that sufferers cannot be cured by simple \u00e2\u20ac\u0153willpower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His innovative approach to treatment combined surgical intervention and continued psychological and dietetic assistance, which ongoing research supports. In 2007 Alberic set up the bariatric unit at University College hospital, London, remaining its director until 2009. He was also president of the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society (2010-13) and later undertook medico-legal work as an expert witness. He was born Alberic Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes in Bakewell, Derbyshire, the youngest of five children of Sir Maurice Fiennes, managing director of Davy and United Engineering Company, and Sylvia Finlay, the daughter of a British army officer. Alberic was educated at the Lyceum Alpinum Zuoz, Switzerland, where he learned to speak Swiss German, German, French, Italian and Romansh. He also became an expert skier and enjoyed this sport for life. He started a degree in zoology at the University of Zurich before enrolling at St Bartholomew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospital medical college in London. Alberic graduated in 1976, with first class honours. During this time he also flew light aircraft with the RAF volunteer reserve. He passed the examinations for the Royal College of Surgeons in 1978, winning the Hallett prize as the highest-scoring candidate in the country. As a lead surgeon during the 1988 Clapham Junction rail crash, he recognised the need for improved training in trauma care among surgeons in the UK and helped establish advanced trauma life support (ATLS) training for them. Alberic was committed to lifelong care of his patients, who valued his clarity, focus and empathy. His colleagues described him as extremely trustworthy; sensitive to the needs of others; quick to provide help where needed; and an outstanding teacher to many surgeons in the UK. He was a brilliant wordsmith and artist, a talented craftsman and a devoted Guardian reader. He supported the charity Freedom from Torture from 1996 until his death, and was passionate about community welfare and politics. Alberic is survived by Louise, whom he married in 1985, his daughters, Emily and me, and by his grandson, William."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/may/18/keith-neal-obituary", "primaryCategory": "education", "title": "Keith Neal obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives: </strong>Biology teacher at Manchester Grammar school who gave his students an international outlook", "author": "Michael Smith", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T19:09:10Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036367", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/216964005bd15a440db144e4a0c4155abe08588c/0_98_349_209/master/349.jpg", "body": "My friend Keith Neal, who has died aged 84, taught biology at Manchester grammar school (MGS) for 23 years, turning it from an elite, esoteric A-level to one of the most popular subjects at GCSE. As head of department, and ardent environmentalist, he enthused his students through his knowledge and adventurous field trips. He was an internationalist, taking students to India in 1988 and 1993, and on a groundbreaking trip to China in the late 1990s. He went to Africa 26 times. He visited Sierra Leone 15 times between 2002 and 2012, to help deliver courses on the moral foundations of democracy, following brutal civil war. He was an ambassador for the charity SolarAid. This took him to Kenya in 2018 to promote solar lamps, replacing polluting kerosene lanterns. Keith established a link between MGS and Busoga college in Uganda, supporting the Busoga Trust and donating money for wells and textbooks. He visited Busoga in 1992, returning there in 1995 and 1999. Mancunians donated 86 computers to Busoga college. Keith was born in Cirencester, the son of the biologist Ernest Neal, a world authority on badgers, and Betty (nee Thomson), who was also a science graduate. When Keith was eight, the family moved from the Cotswolds to Somerset. His father taught biology at Taunton school, where Keith was educated. He enjoyed cross-country running and summer scout camps.

Their victory was finalized with a unanimous vote by 17 dancers in favor of unionization on Thursday morning , and marks the first time that the Actors Equity association, a century-old union for stage actors, singers and dancers, will represent strip club workers, the union said. The strippers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign featured colorful, costumed protests, and attracted high-profile support, with the Amazon Union president, Chris Smalls, and Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine both showing up in solidarity. For Charlie, a 23-year-old Star Garden dancer, spending eight months of prime weekend nights last year on a picket line rather than working was a financial challenge, but one that proved worth it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The sacrifices we made were definitely sacrifices, but it was for something bigger than us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The dancers were fighting for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a future where unionization exists for strippers who want it. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bigger than struggling to pay rent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The campaign, which started in March 2022, was galvanized by what dancers said were unsafe working conditions, and what they described as retaliatory firings of dancers who tried to address customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 dangerous behavior themselves. Although Actors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Equity, which represents more than 50,000 workers, has not organized strip club employees in the past, the union said, the strippers had similar concerns to other performers, from wage theft to post-show security. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Strippers are live entertainers. While some elements of their job are unique, they are essentially performance artists, and have a lot in common with other Equity members who dance for a living,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kate Shindle, the union president, said in a statement. Shindle called the Star Garden dancers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolute warriors throughout this long process\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As well as concerns about sexual harassment and dancer safety, the union campaign was driven by labor concerns that strippers share with other workers, such as workplace injuries that affect dancers in their highly physical work, and that make health insurance essential. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just walking around in six- to eight-inch heels every night is a lot of wear and tear on your body,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie, the Star Gardens dancer, said. Strippers also need mental health support, she added, since many patrons want someone willing to listen to their struggles and show empathy, making the job in many ways similar to the emotional labor of being a therapist or a social worker. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would say most of my social work experience has been in my underwear,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie said. She said the union win built on decades of campaigns by sex workers advocating for safe working conditions, and had crucial support from the advocacy group Strippers United. After more than a year of legal battles, which included the club filing for bankruptcy, the union and the Star Garden owners announced a settlement on Tuesday, which will allow the dancers to proceed with a union vote, and the club to reopen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Star Garden is committed to negotiating in good faith with Actor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Equity a first of its kind collective bargaining agreement which is fair to all parties,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said An Ruda, an attorney for Star Garden, in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Star Garden decided to settle, as it has always been a fair and equal opportunity employer, that respects the rights of its employees.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The North Hollywood dancers said they hoped their victory would galvanize new union efforts at other US strip clubs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not just a win for the dancers at this club, but the entire strip club industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lilith, a Star Garden dancer, in a statement. Star Garden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vote comes a decade after the 2013 closure of the Lusty Lady, a worker-owned club in San Francisco, which unionized with the Service Employees International Union in 1997. At that time, it was the only unionized strip club in the US. While the Lusty Lady had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a good run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the California club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unionization ultimately did not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spark organizing all over the country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as workers had hoped it would, said Kristina Zinnen, a former Lusty Lady dancer who went on to become a San Francisco labor lawyer. Over the years, Zinnen said, she had talked to at least 10 groups of strippers trying to organize their workplaces, but none of those campaigns succeeded. One of the major hurdles to organizing strippers has been finding the right union to back them, Zinnen said. The new involvement of the powerful and well-resourced Actors Equity was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and might signal a broader interest in organizing other clubs. The Star Garden dancers made a strategic effort to make their picketing entertaining to demonstrate to the club owners, and customers, that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we are the club \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without us, the business doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charlie said. Protesting on a North Hollywood street corner until 1am or 2am took stamina, and sometimes came with safety concerns, Charlie said. But the dancers focused on a charm offensive, she said, aiming to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153be flirty and strippery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while pushing the labor movement. The dancers asked patrons to come back another time, visit a different club, or party with them on the picket line rather than going inside, she said. Each night the picket had a different theme, with costumes and props, from witches to pageant night to dad night (they brought a grill), to big cats. One night, the theme was the environmental and safety violations they were fighting, and dancers dressed up as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broken glass\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a hole in the stage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The strippers also built a following on social media, and used supporters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 contributions to make the 15-month protest possible, though most dancers also worked other jobs to pay rent, Charlie said.

Throughout his life he had a love of cricket. While studying at Merton College, Oxford, in the 1950s he was serving as 12th man for Oxford University against the Australian touring side when the Australians lost a man to injury and Mike was called on to replace him. This unusual event was documented in Wisden. Born in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, to Edith (nee Cox) and Ken Rines, who ran a radio and electrical shop in the town, Mike attended Scarborough high school for boys, where he first developed an interest in cricket. He helped in the dressing room at Scarborough Cricket Club, met such giants as Wally Hammond, Jack Hobbs and Len Hutton and went on to top the batting averages for Scarborough, playing alongside Freddie Truman. After national service in the RAF, Mike went to Merton College, where he graduated with a law degree. In the mid-1950s he met Ann Parker at a ball in Scarborough and they married in 1958. The following year, the couple moved to Leeds, where Mike worked for Yorkshire Imperial Metals before becoming editor of Marketing magazine in 1970, despite very little journalistic experience. He threw himself into the role and made the magazine much more than a trade publication, regularly breaking stories picked up by national news media, such as his challenge to the tobacco industry over their launch in the 1970s of New Smoking Material, supposedly a safer alternative to cigarettes, which Mike claimed was simply a marketing ploy. A love of sailing started on a family camping holiday to Spain where he rigged a towel to a small pole and fashioned a sailing boat from an inflatable dinghy. The passion culminated in his saving and restoring the yacht Nancy Blackett, once owned by the Swallows and Amazons author Arthur Ransome and fictionalised as The Goblin in the book We Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Mean to Go to Sea. In retirement in Suffolk, Mike took on voluntary projects such as editing the Woodbridge newsletter and organising its maritime festival, and he arranged for the publication in 2012 of the novel Their Cemetery Sown With Corn, written by his former schoolmaster, Frank Binder, which detailed how, at a local level, a civilised society can quickly fall into the grip of tyranny. Ann died in 2020. Mike is survived by their three children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c my brother, Nick, sister, Vicky, and me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a granddaughter, Molly."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/may/18/surrey-v-kent-notts-v-essex-and-more-county-cricket-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "County cricket: Ashes intrigue at Hove on day one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00c2\u00a0as it happened", "lead": "Sussex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ollie Robinson trapped Glamorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marnus Labuschagne while Somerset\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s batters made hay at Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s", "author": "Tanya Aldred", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T18:44:17Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036375", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/425d9b142e1116d382aa5314fb921b0e4296d487/0_56_3422_2054/500.jpg", "body": "Ollie Robinson squeezed the Ashes klaxon, trapping Marnus Labuschagne for just one at Hove. He was one of four wickets for Robinson as Glamorgan disintegrated for 123. But there were more treats in store for those who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d made the trip to the south coast. Shortly before half past six, Labuschagne pulled at the cuffs of his shirt sleeves and sent down two overs of his legspin at Steve Smith. His Australia teammate was not tempted, and moved with characteristic twitch and scratch to an unbeaten 68. Smith also watched with interest as Michael Neser, vying for a late baggy green call-up, dismissed Cheteshwar Pujara for his first Sussex duck. Six Test bowlers were dotted across the scorecards at Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, where Middlesex spent the day chasing the ball. Two early wickets had left Somerset vulnerable, but George Bartlett bounced to his first century of the year, and Tom Abell 77, as they put on a brisk third wicket partnership of 183. Tom Kohler-Cadmore, advertising his best Bazball credentials, got off the mark with a six into the pavilion and added 68 in 60 balls. Hampshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Vince tucked his napkin in and got stuck into the Northamptonshire bowling, as he had at Wantage Road last month. This time he got within a contented belch of his hundred, before being caught after propping forward to Rob Keogh for 95. Around him, Liam Dawson made an unbeaten 55 and there were forties from Fletcha Middleton and Ben Brown. On a flat Bristol pitch, Graham Clark made his first hundred for six years as Durham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s batting express steamed onwards against Gloucestershire, knocking up almost 400 runs in a day. There were four wickets for Zafar Gohar. Twenty-two wickets fell at New Road on a day of swinging balls, unpredictable bounce and nervous batting. First Leicestershire were bowled out for 173; held together only by a late-order 30 by Chris Wright and a fifty from Colin Ackermann. Wright, warmed up, then filleted Worcestershire with five wickets for a sneeze, as they were bowled out for 83. Kent made Surrey sweat over their last wicket at The Oval, as Joey Evison and Michael Hogan added 82 in 14 overs and even collected a batting point. Unexpected riches from an unpromising 118-7. At Trent Bridge, Alastair Cook knocked up 72 in Essex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 298, with three wickets for Nottinghamshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stuart Broad. Three South Asian Cricket Academy graduates made their Championship debuts on Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Zaman Akhter (Gloucestershire), Arafat Bhuiyan (Kent) and Zain Ul-Hassan (Glamorgan).

I can still remember her dismissing my medium-pace half-volleys with indifference and aplomb.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Surely not indifference?! Right ok, with Steve Smith doing back stretches at the non-striker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end at Hove, 36 not out, and Worcestershire nine down for 52 against the mighty Leicestershire, time for me to (Chris) write up for the paper. BTL remains open all hours. A typically quiet day in the County Championship. Kent add 160 for the last three wickets against the top of the table boys; the bottom of Haines bat falls off \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as he is caught in the slips for 58; and Worcestershire have lost their sauce. as Finch falls for 1. Wright 5-21, Worcs 48-8. And a lead for Sussex, 125-3, with Steve Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radar starting to buzz and twitch, 28 not out. Worcestershire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day swirls rapidly down the plughole of misfortune. Three ducks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for Azhar, Roderick and Hose. Wright 4-20; Davey 2-24. Worcs 45-6. Amusing scenes for the chasing pack at The Oval, where the extra half hour is taken to finish Kent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innings off \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but instead Kent take tea still nine down, a batting point in the bag. Kent 271-9, Evison 76 not out, Hogan 39 not out.

Neser traps Pujara for a duck, showing Steve Smith just why he should be in the Test squad. Sussex 102-3. Not many for Rehan Ahmed, top scorer Colin Ackermann with 52. Three wickets each for Joe Leach and Matthew Waite. At The Oval, Joey Evison wasps a short ball from Dan Worrall, six hooked off his eyebrows. Kent 209-9, a good recovery but suggests they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be on the back foot for four days. His seventh, and first of the year. Tom Kohler Cadmore, as previously signposted, has guns blazing and gets off the mark with a six. Somerset 211-3. Following the Newton le Willows news, an email from Joe Molloy, Sale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2nd XI wicketkeeper.

Agar clenches his glove in frustration. Kent 192-8. Enter our third debutant, Arafat Bhuiyan. Would pretty runs for James Vince improve your afternoon? Here you are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c his third fifty of the season. Round the Div one grounds: Vince and Brown applying the usual balm to the Hampshire batting card \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 175-3, a partnership of 87. George Bartlett approaches his first hundred of the year, Tom Abell 71 not out, as Somerset continued their frankly out of character innings building. Somerset 173-2. Notts have broken Essex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flourishing second wicket partnership, Peterson grabbing both Alastair Cook (72) and Tom Westley (66). Essex 170-3. And Surrey continue to chomp through Kent, Joey Evison and Wes Agar inching them towards 200, Kent 175-7. Two wickets for Dan Worrall, who I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learnt becomes eligible for England next year. Sussex scoring at six an over as they aim to overtake Glamorgan by tea: 37-0, Orr (14) and Haines (23). But the early-season B-ballers (as promised, pre-season) remain Durham, who are whizzing along at over four against Gloucestershire, nearly 50 overs in. 204-4. Borthwick out for 54, Bedingham for 40. Writes Gary Naylor: Down and out in just over a session. Four for that Ollie Robinson,three for Karvelas. An interesting story here by friend of CCLive and foraging expert, Jamie Bowman, in the St Helen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Star, about Newton le Willows signing North West Thunder and London Spirit allrounder Naomi Dattani. It is the first time a Liverpool competition side have signed a female professional to play men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cricket. She is expected to make her debut tonight in a T20 game v Hightown St Mary\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. A super recovery from Somerset this morning, from 10-2, an unbroken partnership of 110 between Abell and Bartlett at Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The first half centuries tick over: for Durham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s captain Scott Borthwick (Durham 147-2) and for Alastair Cook (Essex 109-1). Only 16 wickets fell this morning round all the grounds apart from at Hove. At Hove, Glamorgan lost eight. A couple more in the bag since the lunch-time resumption: Leicestershire lose last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s batnball maestro Wiaan Mulder for a duck, 83-5; and Kent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Jack Leaning edges to third slip atThe Oval, Kent 99-5. DIVISION ONE The Rose Bowl: Hampshire 96-3 v Northamptonshire Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: Middlesex v Somerset 96-2 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Essex 86-1 The Oval: Surrey v Kent 98-4 DIVISION TWO Bristol: Gloucestershire v Durham 127-2 Hove: Sussex v Glamorgan 83-8 New Road: Worcestershire v Leicestershire 83-4 And two wickets in an over by Worcestershire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matthew Waite puts Leicestershire in a pickle just before lunch, 80-4. Hampshire wobble after a high-speed start, now 92-3 against Northants. Fletcha Middleton bowled for 40 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c another good start. James Vince always seems to be batting for Hampshire, and here he is again. A wicket each for Buckingham, Sales and White. Division One: Chris Rushworth (30), Mohammad Abbas (26), Brett Hutton (25), Daniel Worral (21), Lewis Gregory (21). Division Two: Timm van der Gugten (28), Matthew Potts (24), Ben Raine (23), Joe Leach (17), Michael Neser and Jordan Thompson (16) Five games in, the leading Div one scorers are: James Rew (539), Josh Bohannon (471), Sam Hain (436), Ben Compton (431), Tom Westley (413). In Div Two: Cheteshwar Pujara (545), Rishi Patel (517), Lewis Hill (398), Tom Alsop (396), Peter Handscomb (395), Foakes leaps across first slip, nearly pick-pockets second, to snaffle Billings, and a wicket maiden for Lawes. Kent 80-4. Your thoughts on Glamorgan making three figures? Currently 65-6. Not much left to scrape around for in the batting drawer. Two for Ollie Robinson in his last Sussex appearance of the season (?). A fence to third slip, gone for 19. Such a weird situation he finds himself in, I feel for the guy. Hope he gets a big one at Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. A smart catch for Ben Foakes behind the stumps, who will be feeling the love from the Surrey faithful. Muyeye a tidy 22, Kent 71-3. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how this ended up on my twitter feed, but I was quite amused by Ben Compton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disdain for the question. A fourth Glamorgan wicket falls, they seem to have temporarily forgotten that they are a heady fourth in the table. Ul-Hassan joins the dressing-room bench, with the consolation that he has by far the highest score, 22. Glamorgan 50-4, a wicket each for Haines, Karvelas, Robinson and Hudson-Prentice. In Division Two: Leeds and Borthwick are making good progress against Gloucestershire, though Lees more cautiously than he has been. Durham 41-1. Glamorgan are suffering a batting malfunction against Sussex, though debutant Ul-Hassan is still there on 16. The Worlds No.1 Test batsman lbw Ollie Robinson for just one. Glamorgan 31-3. Rishi Patel, last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s centurion and match-saver, is 16 not out in Leicestershire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 55-1. Budinger caught off Leach for 30 And thanks to Mes for pointing out that Durham have made some great-sounding upgrades at CLS to make the ground more inclusive for those for all, including a sensory room, a multi-faith room and new disabled accessible changing facility, which meets the needs of those with complex care needs and includes a height adjustable adult-sized changing bench, ceiling track hoist system and peninsular toilet. Half an hour gone, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been occurring in Division One? A typically wobbly Somerset start, 21-2 at Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s' a wicket each for TRJ and Murtagh. Hampshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unreliable batting order are off to a flier against Northants,Hants 46-0. Stuart Broad has his first wicket at Trent Bridge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Browne for 11 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is running in against his old captain SirALastair. Broad now looks marker-penned in for the whole summer given the fast bowling injury list. Hope the old bones can take it. Essex 34-1. And Kent? Better than you might have feared, 19-1 agains the juggernauting 2022 Champs. Zak Crawley, Test place reaffirmed, 8 not out. Ali spoke to Jonny Bairstow after his recall. Empathy for Foakes, but the biggest surprise was the nugget that England cricket have a partnership with Radox \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bubble baths all round. A fabulous day for the South Asian Cricket Academy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c three graduates make their debuts this Thursday morning.

From Sunday onwards, it all becomes a jigsaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two games in June around the T20 Blast, three in July, then a break for The Hundred and back for the denouement in September. So kick off your socks for these four days, while nature hangs in perfect* May balance.

This week, after Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Europe, the UK and the Netherlands said they would create an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153international coalition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to procure the US-made F-16s and train Ukrainian pilots and crews. Emmanuel Macron also said there were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no taboos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Ukrainian pilots being trained in France in a TV interview on Monday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shifting the focus to the US, which has to consent to the transfer of any F-16s to Ukraine. But the US response has ranged from negative to unenthusiastic. A state department official, when asked about F-16 supply on Wednesday, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to ensure that the assets and systems that we offer our Ukrainian partners are the most impactful, that they can use them now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joe Biden has previously personally ruled out giving F-16s to Ukraine, amid arguments that it would take several months to train pilots and ground crews and that giving them to Ukraine could be interpreted as escalatory. Zelenskiy is due to address the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, which begins on Friday. It is likely the Ukrainian president will try to raise the F-16 issue, although he will want to be careful not to embarrass Biden at the meeting of the leaders of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading economies. Ukraine is desperate for extra air power as it plots a counteroffensive agains the Russian invasion. While its small, Soviet-standard air force remains operational, it is able to run only a dozen or so combat missions a day and cannot risk too many losses in a long war. Yuri Ihnat, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian air force, said Kyiv would be careful with any western jets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not going use the F-16s to hit targets on Russian territory. Territory of Ukraine occupied by Russia, yes. But Russian territory, no. We also need them to patrol the border and keep the Russian air force further away.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The most obvious problem with any gift of F-16s is that it would take at least three and more likely six to nine months to train Ukrainian pilots and crews. Kyiv had been identifying a list of potential pilots and teaching them English so they could begin their tuition, Ihnat said. Plans are being put together slowly. The incoming RAF chief, Sir Richard Knighton, told MPs that details of the scheme were yet to be finalised, while the New York Times reported that Ukrainian pilots were not being allowed by the US to train on F-16s owned by European militaries. The attraction for Ukraine is that there are 3,000 F-16s, a jet that dates back to the late 1970s, in service in 25 countries, including several smaller European nations such as the Netherlands. But they are not used by the UK, France or Germany, which are able only to provide training and some related services. Ben Wallace said on Wednesday during a trip to Berlin: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the White House to decide if it wants to release that technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK defence minister said he did not think F-16s were the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153magic wand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battlefield needs, given it would take so long to supply them. On Thursday, Wallace also confirmed that Ukraine had used the long-range Storm Shadow missiles for first time since the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gift of them was announced a week ago, as he signed a defence agreement with his Norwegian counterpart to ward off threats to undersea pipelines. Wallace also expressed an interest in running Nato after the secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, steps down in autumn. On Wednesday, when asked if he would be interested in the future vacancy, he told a German news agency: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always said it would be a good job.

Samantha Lee has been accused of conducting an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely poor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd investigation after Couzens, 50, exposed himself to female staff at a drive-through McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Kent on 14 and 27 February 2021, a police disciplinary hearing was told. Lee, 29, was said to have failed to secure CCTV footage when she visited the restaurant on 3 March, hours before Couzens abducted Everard, 33, in Clapham, south-west London. Lee was also accused of lying when later questioned about her actions, claiming she believed the CCTV at the restaurant deleted automatically. Lee denied gross misconduct, lying and breaching the force\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standards on duties and responsibilities as well as honesty and integrity. While under investigation for the alleged failings, she quit the force and reportedly set up an OnlyFans account called Officer Naughty. On Thursday, Lee told the hearing she should have asked more questions about the CCTV and properly logged evidence, including the McDonald\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s receipts that showed the last four digits of Couzens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mastercard and the date and time he exposed his penis to female members of staff. At the of end her evidence, she was asked if she wanted to add anything about the case. She told the hearing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would say I accept I could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done more around the CCTV inquiries and evidence gathering, those were errors on my part and I fully accept that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As much as I thought over and over about what I could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done different, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anything would\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve changed the tragic outcome of what happened later that day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When asked about the mistakes she had admitted to, Lee added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just not sure what caused the errors, I hold my hands up to all of them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lee was accused of failing to escalate the case so officers from Kent police could have been sent to Couzens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 house in Deal. However, Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commanding officer, Insp Rita Jones, told the hearing that even if Lee had, an arrest would not have happened until the next day at best. In his closing speech, Paul Ozin KC, for the Met police, drew attention to Insp Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 evidence and said Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged failings \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably would not have prevented the appalling crimes committed by Wayne Couzens on 3 March 2021\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

She said she joined the Met in April 2016 because she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wanted to make a difference\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Her former commanding officer Sgt Kelly Cooper told the hearing that Lee was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd officer, describing her as compassionate, understanding and empathic. In a statement read by Saunders, Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, Liola, described her daughter as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a tower of strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the bravest people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she knew. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sadly this investigation has been too much,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added.

The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest supermarket, which was bought by the billionaire Issa brothers and private equity firm TDR Capital in 2020, said it was in consultation about removing a 60p an hour supplement from workers at 39 stores sited outside the M25 but near to the capital. Asda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new owners have been looking to make savings across the business as the cost of debt on their \u00c2\u00a37bn deal has soared since they took control. They are reportedly considering a merger with their petrol forecourts business EG to reduce their joint debt burden. The proposal is the latest in a run of cost-cutting moves from Asda including reducing premiums for delivery drivers in the autumn and closing pharmacies and changing night shifts earlier this year. The GMB union, which represents many of the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workers, said the proposed pay cut for those near London was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153classic private equity slash and burn tactics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ahead of the potential merger. Nadine Houghton, GMB organiser, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cutting the pay of 7,000 low-paid retail workers during a cost of living crisis is inexcusable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said the cost cuts were part of preparation for the proposed tie-up with EG and called on the government to block it. Houghton said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the business secretary [Kemi Badenoch] allows this merger to go ahead, she will be responsible for allowing a deal that is bad for workers, bad for consumers and bad for the high street. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These slash and burn tactics, along with food and fuel price increases, will only ramp up if the merger goes ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The union said it was concerned that workers who did not agree to change their contracts would be threatened with so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire and rehire\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tactics, under which anyone failing to agree could lose their job. Asda said no final decision had been made on the pay cut for the 7,000 staff but it was considering making the change as none of its rivals paid a similar supplement in those areas. Asda introduced a 10% pay rise for all hourly paid shopfloor workers to a minimum of \u00c2\u00a311 an hour last month and has pledged to increase pay to \u00c2\u00a311.10 an hour from July.

Nima Momeni, 38, was arraigned on Thursday in a San Francisco courtroom on a single murder charge in Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death last month. Momeni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney entered the plea on her client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behalf. The judge ordered Momeni to remain in jail without bail. San Francisco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, has alleged that Momeni planned to kill Lee and left him at the scene bleeding after the stabbing. Lee was found by police with multiple stab wounds in downtown San Francisco in the predawn hours of 4 April. He was taken to San Francisco general hospital and died while doctors operated on him. A kitchen knife was recovered from the surrounding area, Jenkins had previously said. In the days after the killing, pundits and some tech executives had been quick to argue that Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death was an example of violent crime running rampant in the northern California city. But prosecutors soon revealed that Lee and Momeni had been acquainted with each other. Prosecutors allege the stabbing was the result of a dispute between the two men that centered on Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Momeni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister, Khazar Elyassnia, who has become a key figure in the case that now centers around alleged drug use and romantic intrigue. Elyassnia, 37, is married to well known Bay Area plastic surgeon Dino Elyassnia. Momeni, her older brother, was the owner of a Bay-Area IT consulting firm called ExpandIT, and has worked as a consultant and system engineer at a number of tech companies over the years, according to his LinkedIn profile. According to court filings, Momeni had confronted Lee about his relationship with Elyassnia and an incident the day prior to the stabbing, when Lee and Elyassnia had spent time together in an apartment. Prosecutors say a witness had said that Momeni and Lee went to Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hotel room, where Momeni demanded to know if his younger sister \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was doing drugs or anything inappropriate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which Lee denied. Security footage shows Momeni and Lee leaving a building together on the night of the stabbing, and getting into Momeni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s BMW around 2am. Prosecutors say that Momeni drove to a dark and secluded spot, where he attacked Lee with a kitchen knife, stabbing him three times, including once in the heart. He then sped away \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and left victim to slowly die\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to court documents. In a motion filed on Monday, Paula Canny, Momeni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defense attorney, argued that the narrative put out by San Francisco police is based on hard-to-see video evidence, the San Francisco Standard newspaper reported. Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom on Thursday, Canny described Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death as a combination self-defense and accident, the Standard reported. She also said Momeni is not a US citizen, and is at risk of being deported to his home country of Iran. Canny and the San Francisco district\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney office did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/18/montreal-mafia-mob-killing-claudia-iacono", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo one is untouchable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Montreal mob-related killing sparks worry of gang war", "lead": "Claudia Iacono, who was married to son of the late boss Moreno Gallo, was shot dead in her car outside the spa she owned", "author": "Leyland Cecco in Toronto", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T18:09:52Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036397", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4c1f0258c71839d615a96bcfecae3f81f019ffb8/0_142_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "The brazen daylight shooting death of a Montreal mob boss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daughter-in-law suggests \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no one is untouchable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said an organized crime expert, as the city braces for potential retaliation.

Scientists have highlighted evidence that suggests kissing was practised in some of the earliest Mesopotamian societies and documented in ancient texts from 2500BC that have been largely overlooked. In an article published in the journal Science, researchers also cited evidence that kissing may have contributed to the spread of orally transmitted diseases such as cold sores. Although research had suggested that friendly or familial kissing was a common behaviour between humans across time and geography, romantic-sexual kissing was not thought to be culturally universal. Researchers said the findings suggest kissing was considered an ordinary part of romantic intimacy in ancient times across many cultures and did not originate in a specific region, as earlier research had proposed. A previous hypothesis suggested that the earliest evidence of kissing came from what would be modern-day India in 1500BC. Ancient Mesopotamian texts suggest that kissing was something that married couples did, though kissing was also seen as a part of an unmarried person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desires when in love. Dr Troels Pank Arb\u00c3\u00b8ll, an expert on the history of medicine in Mesopotamia at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In ancient Mesopotamia, which is the name for the early human cultures that existed between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers in present-day Iraq and Syria, people wrote in cuneiform script [wedge-shaped marks] on clay tablets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many thousands of these clay tablets have survived to this day, and they contain clear examples that kissing was considered a part of romantic intimacy in ancient times, just as kissing could be part of friendships and family members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 relations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Therefore, kissing should not be regarded as a custom that originated exclusively in any single region and spread from there but rather appears to have been practised in multiple ancient cultures over several millennia.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Studies have shown that bonobos kiss with a romantic-sexual purpose and chimpanzees engage in platonic kissing to manage social relationships. As the closest living relatives to humans, scientists said these practices hint at the ancient presence and evolution of the behaviour in humans. The researchers also said kissing may have unintentionally played a role in the transmission of pathogens, such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), which causes cold sores and diphtheria, a highly contagious bacterial infection. It is thought that bu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122shanu, a disease described in ancient medical texts, could be the HSV-1 infection.

The Manchester City manager was trying to process, decompress and, yes, enjoy the Champions League semi\u00e2\u20ac\u2018final, second-leg dismantling of Real Madrid on Wednesday night when it was put to him that Jack Grealish had just said the team felt unstoppable. In fairness to Grealish, he had called it after the first leg in Madrid, using the same word to describe the mood in the City dressing room before the Etihad return. To Guardiola, it was probably the only time the winger put so much as a syllable out of place. Grealish was outstanding, albeit he was hardly alone in that regard as City stormed to a 4-0 win for a 5-1 aggregate success to set up a final against Internazionale in Istanbul on 10 June. There was a moment in the second half when Guardiola blew kisses at Grealish, which was certainly a counterpoint to the blow-up with Kevin De Bruyne. Guardiola and the midfielder exchanged angry words and gestures after De Bruyne made a bad decision on the ball. The emotions were raw. Back to Grealish. Guardiola wanted to say it was great his players felt unstoppable and it is plainly a statement of fact \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 23 games without defeat, one win away from another Premier League title, into the finals of the FA Cup and now the Champions League. The ultimate treble, the Manchester United treble, is within their grasp. But, you know, maybe don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say it out loud. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because every team is stoppable if you do what you have to do \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in football, things change completely from one day to the next,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guardiola said. And, because, if there was one area of sensitivity for him after such a colossal victory and epic run, it is the notion City merely have to turn up in Istanbul to scratch their Champions League itch. Inter are a good team, defensively secure in their 3-5-2 system. They have kept clean sheets in five of their six knockout ties, the exception being the 3-3 home draw in the quarter-final second leg against Benfica. They had been 3-1 up on the night and 5-1 to the good on aggregate when they conceded two after the 86th minute. The suspicion remains that Inter have enjoyed a nice draw; they had Porto in the last 16 and, after Benfica, Milan in the semi-final. They lost at home and away to Bayern Munich in the group phase although, decisively for their qualification, they did take four points from Barcelona. They sit third in Serie A. Guardiola would laugh off the idea that complacency stands to be an enemy for City and when have they been anything less than laser-like in their focus? Also, they will have the heartbreak of the 2021 final defeat against Chelsea in their minds, just as they did last season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-final loss to Madrid before this rematch. But it will be an element of the external narrative and it was interesting to see how Guardiola addressed it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there is one incredible detail of this team that I am so proud of, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s they are so humble,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every game, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter the opponent or the competition \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they take it seriously. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hate the arrogance in sports. I hate the moments when you believe you are something that you are not. The people are going to talk now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they [Inter] are not favourite, we are favourite and so on \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that is the worst that can happen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can listen you are the favourite, you believe that you are, you believe you are something special \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you are not. We are favourites from the beginning of the season \u00e2\u20ac\u201c favourites, favourites \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to handle. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had that feeling [of pressure all along]. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guardiola can take heart from how his backup players have performed when called upon, how they are training, which is a barometer every manager looks for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c take Aymeric Laporte, Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden and Juli\u00c3\u00a1n \u00c3\ufffdlvarez for example. The last three of those came on towards the end against Madrid, Mahrez and Foden combining to set up \u00c3\ufffdlvarez for the final goal. But what really fortifies Guardiola is the form of his starters and on Wednesday it was impossible to give any of them a rating of less than 8/10. Maybe the goalkeeper, Ederson, because he had so little to do? There was precious little jeopardy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a theme of the past few months, which can leave the neutral feeling a little cold. It would be wrong to reverse-engineer the result as being down to Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shortcomings. They had looked like a champion team in the first leg and the reason they came to resemble a lower-league minnow on a Cup visit to the Etihad, clinging on in the face of the onslaught \u00e2\u20ac\u201c mainly in the first half \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was because City simply swamped them. Their intensity and high-speed patterns of play were too much. Guardiola had picked up on a comment from Toni Kroos, the Madrid midfielder stating his team could have lost 10-1 or 10-2 in last season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first leg at the Etihad only for it to finish 4-3 against them, paving the way for the comeback. Guardiola felt his team had played the same game in that first leg as they did on Wednesday; it was just they did not get what they deserved. As City passed up chances in the first 20 minutes, it would have been easy for them to fret. Ditto when Madrid began to make a few inroads in the second half at 2-0 down; a goal might have changed the dynamics, awakened the demons. But City did not relent. It was a triumph of mentality, too. Guardiola wanted his team to be quicker and more incisive in the attacking transitions than in the first leg, and got just that. He explained that his more patient approach at the Bernab\u00c3\u00a9u was down in part to the state of the turf. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I heard that the grass was really, really bad, really poor, and I needed to put one more player in our buildup for more control of the game,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Guardiola would only say that revenge for last season had been a factor after the second leg, having previously denied it. He also refused to engage on the matter of whether a victory over Madrid was even sweeter for a Barcelona man like him. Everybody knows the truth. Just as they know that Guardiola, as with Grealish, surely feels unstoppable."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/may/18/philadelphia-76ers-rebuild-owners-joel-embiid-trade", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop with Doc Rivers.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same question posed by out-party politicians since time immemorial, but Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spectacular face-plant against the Boston Celtics that prompted Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sacking of head coach Doc Rivers demands a far more wholesale inquest of Philadelphia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s once-proud basketball team. And the picture is not a pleasant one. With a three-games-to-two lead over their archrivals in the Eastern Conference semi-finals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c needing one win from two cracks for the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first trip to the NBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final four in more than two decades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Sixers let the Celtics off the hook in Game 6 and were blown out of the gym in Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decider. Boston star Jayson Tatum, whom Philadelphia passed over after trading up for Markelle Fultz in the 2017 draft, gored them for 51 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most in a Game 7 in NBA history. In a city where sports famously mean a little too much, the Mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day Massacre will leave scars. Nothing the front-office frontman Daryl Morey offered at Wednesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official postmortem offered meaningful solace for the future, least of all the recycled claim that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like 26 teams that would rather have our roster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as if the yawning gap in class and mental toughness between the Sixers and the NBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elite tier wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t laid bare in front of an undivided national audience only a few days before. Somehow, to the extent it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even possible, Philadelphia find themselves even more adrift than when their bold rebuilding plan known as the Process was launched a decade ago this week with the appointment of Sam Hinkie as the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president and general manager \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which itself came on the heels of a far more respectable Game 7 loss at Boston at the same stage. Ten years into the most ambitious, audacious and controversial rebuild in the history of professional sports, the Sixers entered this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playoffs with their finished product finally in place and legitimate title aspirations intact. Now? They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re even worse off than the purgatory that inspired their bold bet on failure: defined by a gutless, joyless identity starting from the top down that calls for nothing less than a scorched-earth rebuild. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take them one by one. The ownership. Josh Harris, the Maryland-born private-equity interloper who became the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first non-local owner when he purchased the team with David Blitzer in 2011, has since bought controlling stakes in the NHL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New Jersey Devils and the NFL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Washington Commanders after trying his hardest to buy the New York Mets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all three sworn adversaries of the local teams. (Were the Cowboys not for sale?) Never have the Sixers felt more like a number in a spreadsheet. Say what you want about the meddlesome Harold Katz \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Nutrisystem founder who delivered a title early in his ownership before steering the team into disaster in the early 1990s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but at least he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a technocratic carpetbagger whose desired endgame included a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153superregional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sports network aligning the Sixers with some of Philadelphia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most detested rivals. The coach. Rivers, the glorified journeyman and notorious choke artist whose most prominent headlines over the past 12 months came when he was caught liking porn on Twitter, is mercifully gone but was a mistake from the start. Competent at keeping his players bought in during the overlong NBA regular season, Rivers has been repeatedly exposed as tactically bankrupt when the game slows down in the playoffs and every possession counts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a shortcoming that had long since been hammered home before the Sixers appointed him. The bold move would be to hire Dawn Staley, a hometown hero on the global stage who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managed the impossible feat of toppling Geno Auriemma as college basketball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Big Boss, as the first female coach in NBA history. But with safer retreads like Monty Williams, Mike Budenholzer, Nick Nurse and (gulp) Mike D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Antoni on the market, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all but certain these owners won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have the courage to make the approach. The star. Joel Embiid, the brittle but unbowed talisman of the Process era, turned in the worst playoff showing of his tenure in a game that represented his destiny. He has built up enough goodwill where even a C-minus effort might have earned him the benefit of the doubt. Instead, the newly minted Most Valuable Player, laid an egg that will echo through the ages, cruelly validating the persistent rumblings he was gifted the MVP award out of voter fatigue. A lot of players don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get even one Game 7 to define their career narratives; Embiid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no-show on Sunday marks his third. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 29 years old at a position where the dropoff past 30 can be steep. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over. Trade him. In fact, no one on the roster besides gifted ingenue Tyrese Maxey and hard-working reserve Paul Reed should be safe. But Morey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks on Wednesday suggested the Sixers remain firmly in the contender class, deluding themselves and their hopelessly devoted fans that a championship is only a few tweaks away. Maintaining the illusion of success will surely help as Harris and co return to the more urgent business of getting out of South Philadelphia, where their lease at the Wells Fargo Center expires in 2031, and lobbying to construct a $1.3bn downtown arena. The proposed venue will be privately funded (though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d continue to read the fine print), but has been met with overwhelming opposition from the nearby Chinatown community over valid fears of displacement and gentrification. Will they relocate the team across the river to New Jersey to pursue their commercial development ambitions if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get their way in Center City? Who knows! The thinking behind the Process was sound enough: disembowel the roster and lose games on purpose with the aim of stockpiling assets over time, mitigating the inherent risks of the draft while reserving cap space for splashy free-agent signings when the time was right. It was a brazen attempt to hack the NBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mechanics, one that flew in the face of the competitive ethos underpinning pro sports. But as the misfires piled up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from Nerlens Noel to Michael Carter-Williams to Jahlil Okafor to Ben Simmons to Markelle Fultz \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the blows became harder to absorb. And when ownership strayed from the blueprint by cutting Hinkie loose and bringing on Bryan Colangelo and Elton Brand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a clean, irrevocable break with ownership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s do no harm policy to that point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the groundwork was spoiled and their fate was sealed. From there it was merely a countdown to Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unequivocal verdict on the Process: the basketball gods have spoken and the language was vengeance. How good were the Sixers at one point in time? Somehow they are still the third winningest franchise in NBA history despite starting later than both clubs ahead of them and having accomplished next to nothing in the four decades since their third title. The team that came closest to a fourth in the years since was fatally flawed but operated with a lunch-pail style and uncompromising defiance that was at least interesting. But by playing it safe in all of the worst ways, Philadelphia is only ensuring their best days will remain behind them."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/may/18/russia-ukraine-war-live-updates-kyiv-missile-strikes-attack", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: Storm Shadow missiles used in Ukraine, says UK defence minister \u00e2\u20ac\u201c  as it happened", "lead": "Ben Wallace says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit is my understanding\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that long-range missiles provided to Ukraine by Britain have been used", "author": "Tom Ambrose (now); Sammy Gecsoyler, Martin Belam and Helen Sullivan (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T17:55:49Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036411", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5f270e325b735faad47b0bf2a92167c07bfd2893/0_111_3138_1883/500.jpg", "body": "The time in Kyiv is just coming up to 9pm.

While Russia boosted its forces in the city, attacked the suburbs to the north and engaged in fierce fighting in the southern suburbs, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces advanced 500 meters in the north and in some areas in the south by one kilometre, deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said on her Telegram channel. The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday that it had struck Ukrainian military targets using high-precision missiles. The claim comes a day after a major wave of missile strikes on Ukrainian cities, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass has reported. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the chief of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wagner mercenary group, on Thursday accused regular Russian army units of pulling back 570 metres north of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, leaving his own fighters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 flanks exposed. Reuters was unable to verify his assertion and there was no immediate comment from the defence ministry. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, told reporters that he and the US president, Joe Biden, have agreed to continue sanctions against Russia and support Ukraine as the two leaders met in the Japanese city of Hiroshima today, Reuters reported.

Zelenskiy is set to join a G7 session on Sunday via teleconference. The Black Sea grain corridor designed to ensure the safe supply of Ukrainian food to world markets has not yet resumed operation despite statements by Turkey and Russia on extending the agreement, a senior Ukrainian official said on Thursday.

The Pentagon overvalued US equipment it sent to Ukraine by about $3bn, a Senate aide and a defence official said on Thursday, an error that opened up the possibility of more weapons being sent to Kyiv for its defence against Russian forces. The error was the result assigning a higher than warranted value on weaponry that was taken from US stocks and then shipped to Ukraine, two senior defence officials said.

Russia launched missiles overnight at Kyiv again, with falling debris causing a fire at a business building, authorities reported. It was the ninth time this month that Russian air raids have targeted the capital, a clear escalation after weeks of lull and ahead of a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive. The attack was carried out by strategic bombers from the Caspian region, probably using cruise missiles, and Russia later deployed reconnaissance craft over the capital. According to preliminary information, all enemy targets were destroyed, Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv Military Administration said in a Telegram post. A person has been killed in Russian missile strikes on Odesa, the military administration spokesman Serhiy Bratchuk has said on Telegram. Two people were injured. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missiles were shot down over the sea by the air defence forces.

The derailment was caused by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interference by outsiders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Crimean railways confirmed in a statement.

Wallace and Norwegian defence minister, Bj\u00c3\u00b8rn Arild Gram, signed a statement of intent to increase cooperation on countering undersea threats in the wake of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack on the Nord Stream gas pipeline. He told the press conference: What we know is the Russians have a work programme, they have a specific naval programme designed to both look at and potentially sabotage or attack critical national infrastructure belonging to its adversaries. It has a number of submarines and other pieces of equipment and spy ships and everything else specifically designed for that purpose. So whether we are talking about Nord Stream, whether we are talking about our own infrastructure, that is an area that is vulnerable and needs to be protected. He added: What we can say without doubt is Russia has the intent and the capability to target the west\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critical national infrastructure. We have to have the intent and the capability to defend it. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said in a Telegram post that Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces had repelled daylong attacks by Russia in the embattled city of Bakhmut on Wednesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The enemy gathered most of its reserves to Bakhmut and significantly strengthened the group,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today the enemy attacked Bakhmut for the entire day. All attacks were repelled.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Pentagon overvalued US equipment it sent to Ukraine by about $3bn, a Senate aide and a defence official said on Thursday, an error that opened up the possibility of more weapons being sent to Kyiv for its defence against Russian forces. The error was the result assigning a higher than warranted value on weaponry that was taken from US stocks and then shipped to Ukraine, two senior defence officials said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve discovered inconsistencies in how we value the equipment that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve given\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Ukraine, one of the senior defence officials told Reuters. The officials and the Senate aide spoke on the condition of anonymity. Congress is being notified of the accounting adjustment on Thursday, the sources said. The defence official said it was possible the amount of overvalued weaponry could grow as the Pentagon examined the situation more thoroughly, increasing the $3bn. A crater left by a Russian missile strike in the village of Tsyrkuny, near Kharkiv in Ukraine. Long-range Storm Shadow missiles provided to Ukraine by Britain have been used, the British defence minister, Ben Wallace, said on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All I can say is it is my understanding that it has been used since we announced its deployment to Ukraine, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to go into further details,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wallace said at a joint press conference with Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence minister, Bj\u00c3\u00b8rn Arild Gram. Meanwhile, Gram said Norway donating F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine was not on the agenda at the moment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When it comes to F-16 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on the agenda now and I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to speculate on any possible future donations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he replied, when asked by a reporter whether Norway would be giving F-16s to Ukraine. The Black Sea grain corridor designed to ensure the safe supply of Ukrainian food to world markets has not yet resumed operation despite statements by Turkey and Russia on extending the agreement, a senior Ukrainian official said on Thursday. The deal has been extended for two more months, in what the UN secretary general, Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres, hailed on Wednesday as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good news for the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a day before Russia could have quit the pact over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports, Reuters reported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was announced yesterday, but so far these statements have not led to the resumption of work and the joint centre in Istanbul did not inspect vessels for entry yesterday or today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yuriy Vaskov, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy restoration minister, told Reuters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expected it to be yesterday immediately after the statements of our partners. We are expecting the partners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 position today and believe that they will be able to resolve this issue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. He added that 62 vessels are ready for inspection and some of them have been standing by for several months. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida told reporters that he and the US president, Joe Biden, have agreed to continue sanctions against Russia and support of Ukraine as the two leaders met in the Japanese city of Hiroshima today, Reuters reports. Kishida also appeared to confirm that the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will not be visiting Japan in person for the G7 summit being held from 19 to 21 May. Zelenskiy is set to join a G7 session on Sunday via teleconference. Today is Vyshyvanka Day, a holiday dedicated to celebrating the traditional type of Ukrainian clothing the day is named after. The US ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget A. Brink, tweeted a video where she is wearing a Vyshyvanka, saying she does so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proudly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the video, Brink said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As Russia attacks not only your territory and your people and also your unique identity and heritage, the US is united with you in celebrating Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture and its history. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While many Ukrainians are trading embroidery for fatigues and uniforms, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m honoured to join my colleagues in wearing such a striking symbol of Ukraine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Serhiy Cherevatyi, a spokesperson for Ukrainian troops in the east, said troops had advanced in parts of Bakhmut by more than a mile, Reuters reports. In televised comments, Cherevatyi said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the fact that our units do not have an advantage in equipment ... and personnel, they have continued to advance on the flanks, and covered a distance of 150 to 1,700 metres (1.1 miles).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Petro Podaru, commander of a Ukrainian artillery unit, also said troops had advanced, despite shelling from the Russian military. Podaru said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, for the most part, as we have started to advance, they are shelling all the routes to front positions, so our armoured vehicles can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deliver more infantry, ammunition and other things,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The mood in Mariupol has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153changed dramatically\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to residents who thought Russia would stay for ever but are now expecting a swift Ukrainian military offensive to recapture the city. In a series of anonymous interviews with the Guardian, people said Mariupol had been transformed into a gloomy version of the Soviet Union since the last Ukrainian defenders holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered to Russian troops a year ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel as if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve fallen into some terrible submerged and downtrodden collective farm. The shops are primitive and the prices astronomical,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The city isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the one I knew. The people are not the same. Everything is changed. I have a permanent feeling of wanting to go home.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They said Russian flags flew above municipal buildings, soldiers were visible on the streets, and portraits of Vladimir Putin and the leader of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, hung on the walls of offices and schools. The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday that it had struck Ukrainian military targets using high-precision missiles. The claim comes a day after a major wave of missile strikes on Ukrainian cities, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass has reported. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Thursday that Moscow had agreed to renew the Black Sea grain deal for two months even though it did not see results when it came to implementing the parts of it which apply to Russia. Speaking at a press conference with his Ugandan counterpart, Lavrov said the deal was aimed at bolstering the food security of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorest people. Lavrov denied that Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s renewal of the part Turkish-brokered deal was related to presidential elections in Turkey. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the chief of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wagner mercenary group, on Thursday accused regular Russian army units of pulling back 570 metres north of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, leaving his own fighters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 flanks exposed. Reuters was unable to verify his assertion and there was no immediate comment from the defence ministry. Wagner forces have been spearheading the assault on Bakhmut, one of the bloodiest and longest battles of the war, something Moscow calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a special military operation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with some support from the regular army in recent months. Prigozhin, who has repeatedly accused Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top military brass of not doing enough to back his men, asked the defence ministry to do all it could to protect Bakhmut\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flanks after what he alleged was a withdrawal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, units of the Russian defence ministry have withdrawn up to 570 metres to the north of Bakhmut, exposing our flanks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prigozhin said in a voice message. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am appealing to the top leadership of the ministry of defence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c publicly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because my letters are not being read,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prigozhin said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please do not give up the flanks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, addressing the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff. Wagner says it has taken most of the shattered city, albeit at enormous human cost. But Ukraine says its forces have retaken territory around Bakhmut in recent days. The former British prime minister Boris Johnson described Emmanuel Macron as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nauseating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for travelling to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin, a former UK government aide has said. Johnson also described Macron as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lickspittle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Guto Harri told the latest edition of Unprecedented, his podcast about his time at No 10. Harri was working as Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s communications chief at the time. He said: There were tensions early on when people like Emmanuel Macron of France went to Moscow to talk to Putin. I think Boris described it privately as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnauseating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. And meanwhile, I think Macron was feeling the tension from Boris seemingly doing the running with helping Ukraine militarily. So, when the British press was giving the British government a hard time over our response to the refugee crisis, Macron turbocharged it by criticising Boris pretty directly and his words were all over the front page of the Guardian on a Friday, I think. And much as Boris is not prone to getting really cross, nor using particularly strong language, this was one where he really flipped and at our morning meeting, I think with a small gang of us he just launched into a violent attack on Emmanuel Macron. Basically, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a four-letter word that begins with C, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a weirdo, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lickspittle. We need to go studs up on this one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rugby term that basically means, gloves off \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe need an orgy of frog bashing. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to have to punch his lights out.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pretty strong stuff. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pleased to say weeks later, of course, they had patched it up. They got on really well. They actually went for a whisky together at the G7 summit. Russia launched missiles overnight at Kyiv again, with falling debris causing a fire at a business building, authorities reported. It was the ninth time this month that Russian air raids have targeted the capital, a clear escalation after weeks of lull and ahead of a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive. The attack was carried out by strategic bombers from the Caspian region, probably using cruise missiles, and Russia later deployed reconnaissance craft over the capital. According to preliminary information, all enemy targets were destroyed, Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv Military Administration said in a Telegram post. A person has been killed in Russian missile strikes on Odesa, the military administration spokesman Serhiy Bratchuk has said on Telegram. Two people were injured. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missiles were shot down over the sea by the air defence forces. Unfortunately, an industrial object was hit: one person died, two were injured,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. Suspilne, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state broadcaster, reports that on the night of 18 May, the Russian army shelled Kostyantynivka in Donetsk region, and one person was killed. Rail traffic has been suspended between Simferopol, capital of the Crimean peninsula, and the city of Sevastopol, after a freight train carrying grain derailed, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russian-installed leader said on Thursday. The derailment was caused by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153interference by outsiders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Crimean railways confirmed in a statement. Russian-imposed governor Sergei Aksyonov said that wagons loaded with grain had derailed and no one was injured. The Black Sea grain deal has been extended for two more months, in what the UN secretary general, Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres, hailed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good news for the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It comes a day before Russia had said it would quit the pact over what it claims are obstacles to its own grain and fertiliser exports. The Kremlin said on Thursday that a delegation from African countries hoping to present their initiative to end the conflict in Ukraine would visit Moscow. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow would be ready to listen to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any proposals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that help resolve the conflict. Court documents show that Jack Teixeira, the US air national guard member charged with being behind the so-called Pentagon leaks of highly classified military documents, was warned repeatedly over his mishandling of classified material. The leaked documents appear to detail US and Nato aid to Ukraine and show real-time details from February and March of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battlefield positions and precise numbers of battlefield gear flowing into Ukraine from its allies. Moldova is no longer using Russian natural gas or electricity after cutting its dependence since war started in Ukraine, prime minister Dorin Recean said on Thursday. Reuters reports the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Thursday that the country had increased its food exports last year, and that Russia needed to help farmers in the regions it claims to have annexed from Ukraine last year. Yesterday Russia agreed to extend the Black Sea grain initiative, after weeks threatening to pull out of the deal, complaining that western sanctions were impeding its ability to export agricultural products. The Kremlin said on Thursday that a delegation from African countries hoping to present their initiative to end the conflict in Ukraine would visit Moscow. Reuters reports Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow would be ready to listen to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153any proposals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that help resolve the conflict. Reuters reports the leaders of the G7 countries will discuss the idea of an international peace summit over Ukraine when they meet in Japan this week, an EU official said on Thursday. G7 leaders will meet on 19-21 May in Hiroshima. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the national security and defence council of Ukraine, has described Kyiv as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maniacal and unattainable goal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd following the latest attacks. He writes: Symbolic places of Kyiv are the target of Russian missile attacks. The Kremlin needs those senseless and super-expensive attacks for Russia on the capital to raise the degree of patriotic hysteria inside the country. In Russia, a process of despair and disappointment with the authorities is developing against the background of the unsuccessful offensive and failures at the front. Emine Dzheppar, deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, has posted a picture of the foreign ministry with a lowered Crimean Tatar flag in memory of the Soviet-era displacement which is commemorated on 18 May. She also restated Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim to restore its borders to a pre-2014 state, including retaking Crimea. She wrote: Today, at Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry we lowered the Crimean Tatar flag to commemorate victims of the forced deportation of indigenous people of Crimea 79 years ago. On 18 May 1944, the Soviet regime started a genocide of Crimean Tatar people to eliminate them and rewrite history of the peninsula. History repeated itself in 2014. Modern Russia applies the worst repressive practices in Crimea. But it failed before and it will fail now again. Liberation of the Crimean peninsula will put an end perverted imperialistic ambitions and respect for human rights be restored worldwide. Moldova is no longer using Russian natural gas or electricity after cutting its dependence since war started in Ukraine, the prime minister, Dorin Recean, said on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If at the start of the war 100% of energy consumed in Moldova originated in Russia, today Moldova can exist with absolutely no natural gas or electricity from Russia,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters reports he told a security conference in Bucharest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moldova no longer consumes Russian gas, it is integrated in the European energy network both technically and commercially.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted to his social media channels to commemorate 18 May as a day of remembrance for Crimean Tatar people forcibly moved by Soviet authorities, as well as Vyshyvanka Day, when Ukraine celebrates the history of its traditional embroidered clothes. He said: This year, the two meanings are united by one date, 18 May. 79 years ago on this day, the Soviet authorities began deporting the Crimean Tatar people. A people they wanted to erase. Deprive of their homes, deprive of the right to life. But the people survived. And they will live freely. Today, I am wearing a special vyshyvanka with ornaments that symbolise the unity of the Ukrainian and Crimean Tatar peoples. Symbols of our strength and our desire to live in our home. Let this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vyshyvanka Day in Ukraine be a reminder of what our people have been through and how strong our culture is. Eternal memory to all our people whose lives were taken by totalitarian regimes. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, has posted to its Telegram channel for Donbas to state that: On the night of 18 May, the Russian army shelled Kostyantynivka in Donetsk region, one person was killed, the ministry of foreign affairs reported. According to preliminary findings, the shelling was conducted from the S-300 complex, several private and apartment buildings, a shop, and administrative buildings were destroyed and damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. If you missed it earlier, overnight it has emerged in court documents that Jack Teixeira, the US air national guard member charged with being behind the so-called Pentagon leaks of highly classified military documents, was warned repeatedly over his mishandling of classified material. Teixeira is accused of sharing highly classified documents about top national security issues in a chatroom on Discord, a social media platform that started as a hangout for gamers. He has not yet entered a plea. The leaked documents appear to detail US and Nato aid to Ukraine and US intelligence assessments regarding allies that could strain ties with those nations. Some show real-time details from February and March of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battlefield positions and precise numbers of battlefield gear flowing into Ukraine from its allies.

Crimea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russian-installed governor Sergei Aksyonov has posted to Telegram to state that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wagons with grain derailed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Simeferopol region. He did not give a cause. It has led to train services being halted. Tass reports that the train service between Simferopol and Sevastopol in Crimea has been suspended. Reuters reports that earlier the Baza Telegram channel, which has links to Russian security services, had reported an explosion on a railway line in the region. The claims have not been independently verified. The Russian Federation unilaterally annexed Crimea in 2014. The FT today has a piece by Felicia Schwartz in Washington and Henry Foy in Tokyo casting forward to later in the year, and raising the spectre that European allies worry about the longevity of US support for Ukraine. They write: Washington has been Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant source of weaponry and US officials say sufficient preapproved funds remain to sustain Kyiv for about five more months, covering a crucial counter-offensive planned for the coming weeks. But European allies are increasingly uncertain about whether the US will come close to matching its existing $48bn package, adopted in 2022, particularly as it requires a vote in Congress this autumn against the backdrop of more partisan debate on the war. With polling showing US support for Ukraine waning, some European allies say the Biden administration is under pressure to show that tens of billions of dollars in assistance have made a significant impact on the battlefield. Some of the officials pointed to the UN general assembly and G20 leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 summit taking place consecutively in early September as two crucial diplomatic events where both sides would come under large pressure to come to the table. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we get to September and Ukraine has not made significant gains, then the international pressure on [the west] to bring them to negotiations will be enormous,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one of the officials on condition of anonymity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The same is true for Russia if the counter-offensive leaves them routed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yesterday Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, posited that the war might come to an end with the US abandoning its allies, citing the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the abandonment of the authorities \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on whom they had relied throughout the 20-year occupation of that country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lavrov said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many political analysts have been writing about this. They predict that this entire crisis will continue for as long as the Americans need it to. These people [the government in Kyiv] will remain in power for as long as the US needs them there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are some photos of the aftermath of this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strikes: d Here is more from Li\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement, via Reuters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China is willing to promote the international community to form the greatest common denominator for resolving the Ukrainian crisis, and make its own efforts to stop the fighting and (establish a) ceasefire and restore peace as soon as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the statement said. Li Hui, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special envoy for Eurasian Affairs, visited Kyiv on Tuesday and Wednesday, where he exchanged views with Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian foreign minister and other state leaders on ways to end the Ukraine-Russia conflict through a political settlement, the foreign ministry statement said. Li, who is a former ambassador to Russia, will also visit Poland, France, Germany and finally Russia during a multi-day trip. He is the most senior Chinese official to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded in February 2022. During Li\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Kyiv, bilateral relations were also discussed, and both sides agreed to work to maintain mutual respect and keep moving forward with mutually beneficial co-operation, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry said. Both governments agreed that a recent phone call between President Xi Jinping and Zelenskiy had pointed out the direction for the development of relations. China and Ukraine agreed they should work together to continue their mutual respect and keep their mutually beneficial cooperation moving forward, the Chinese foreign ministry said in statement on Thursday. The statement comes after China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Special Envoy of Eurasian Affairs Li Hui met with the president of Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China has always played a constructive role in alleviating the humanitarian situation in Ukraine in its own way and will continue to provide assistance to Ukraine within its capacity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the foreign ministry said. It was the ninth time this month that Russian air raids have targeted the capital, a clear escalation after weeks of lull and ahead of a much-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive using newly supplied advanced Western weapons. The attack was carried out by strategic bombers from the Caspian region, probably using cruise missiles, and Russia later deployed reconnaissance craft over the capital. According to preliminary information, all enemy targets were destroyed, Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv Military Administration said in a Telegram post. The air raid alert for Mykolaiv has stopped, governor Vitaly Kim just announced on Telegram. The military also reports \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cruise missile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attacks in the central Vinnytsia region of Ukraine, and local media reported explosions in Khmelnytskyi, about 100 kilometres further west. A person has been killed in Russian missile strikes on Odesa, the military administration spokesman Serhiy Bratchuk has said on Telegram. Two people were injured. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missiles were shot down over the sea by the Air Defense Forces. Unfortunately, an industrial object was hit: 1 person died, two were injured,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. This morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strikes on Kyiv are the ninth in a series of recent raids by Russia that are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented in their power, intensity and variety,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Kyiv City Regional City Administration (KMBA) wrote a short while ago on Telegram. Air raid alerts are still in place for Kyiv. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This time the attack was carried out by strategic bombers Tu-95MS, Tu-160 from the Caspian region, probably by cruise missiles of the X-101/555 type. After launching the rockets, the enemy deployed its reconnaissance UAVs over the capital,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the KMBA wrote. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army reported several explosions in Kyiv and other parts of the country early Thursday morning, urging people to stay in bomb shelters. A fire broke out at a business in the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Darnytskyi district as a result of falling debris, and an explosion was recorded in the Desnyansky district, according to Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The attack on the capital continues. Do not leave the shelters during the air alert!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he implored on Telegram. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Air raid sirens are sounding in Kyiv, where it approaching 7am, as people are urged to take shelter. Russia launched missiles at Kyiv, with falling debris causing a fire at a business building, authorities reported. Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko wrote on Telegram a short while ago: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fire in a garage cooperative due to falling debris in Darnytskyi district. In the same area, debris fell in several places. Previously, there was also an explosion in the Desnyan district. The attack on the capital continues. Do not leave shelters during an air raid!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you more news as it breaks. Here are the other key recent developments: The Black Sea grain deal has been extended for two more months, in what the UN secretary general, Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres, hailed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good news for the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It comes a day before Russia might have quit the pact over obstacles to its grain and fertiliser exports. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a top Chinese envoy at talks in Kyiv on Wednesday that Ukraine would not accept any proposals to end the war that involved losing territory or freezing the conflict, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said. Li Hui, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special representative for Eurasian affairs and former ambassador to Russia, visited Ukraine on 16-17 May. China has notified several foreign missions in Beijing not to display \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politicised propaganda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on their buildings, diplomats have told Reuters, adding the request appeared aimed at Ukrainian flags flown since Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has asked EU governments to add \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3.5bn (US$3.85bn) to the European Peace Facility (EPF), a fund used to finance military aid for Ukraine, EU sources have said. The EPF has already allocated \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.6bn in military aid for Ukraine. Hungary, though, said it would block the next tranche of EU military support and any new sanctions against Russia unless Ukraine removes Hungarian bank OTP from its list of war sponsors. Britain can support Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military by enabling other countries that wish to supply fighter jets and other military equipment to do so, the British defence minister has said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we can obviously contribute is training and support, again, within limits, because we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have F16 pilots,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ben Wallace said at a press conference in Berlin with his German counterpart when asked about international plans to send jets to Ukraine. The Dutch foreign minister said there was no progress to report in international talks on the possible delivery of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reached a solution yet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wopke Hoekstra said on Wednesday in response to questions about earlier announced talks of the Dutch with the UK, Denmark, Belgium and other partners. The German government is looking into mechanisms to secure war damages for Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine, including the possibility of using Russian assets, a government spokesperson said. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, was among European leaders who agreed to set up a register of damages during a meeting in Reykjavik, Reuters reported. Belarus, one of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closest allies, has partially restored controls on their border, Belarusian foreign minister Sergei Aleinik said on Wednesday. This is the first time in 28 years there have been checks at the 770-mile border, AP reported. According to Aleinik, it is to avoid the entry of third-country nationals into Belarus, ahead of the implementation of an intergovernmental agreement on the mutual recognition of visas. The number of Kazakhs who believe neighbouring Russia may invade the former Soviet republic has doubled over the past six months, an opinion poll by Kazakh researchers showed on Wednesday. The central Asian country of 20 million has close ties with Moscow but has maintained neutrality in the Ukrainian conflict, refusing to recognise Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annexations. Ukraine denied on Wednesday that a Russian hypersonic missile had destroyed a US-made Patriot missile defence system during an airstrike on Kyiv. Two US officials said a Patriot system had probably been damaged but did not appear to have been destroyed. The Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhiy Cherevatyi has claimed Ukrainians have made new advances in Bakhmut. Reuters quotes Cherevatyi saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are successfully conducting a defensive operation, counterattacking and during this day our units have penetrated up to 500 metres in some parts of the Bakhmut front.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/18/uk-police-chiefs-issue-assessment-of-violence-against-women-and-girls", "primaryCategory": "society", "title": "Police assessment places violence against women and girls on same footing as terrorism", "lead": "First official document on VAWG in England and Wales is similar to those used for threats such as serious organised crime, say chiefs", "author": "Kevin Rawlinson", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T17:49:43Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036414", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2dcda43a34c9b1dad3a2d29f61822b4c9096c60e/68_198_3365_2019/500.jpg", "body": "Police chiefs have issued the first official assessment of violence against women and girls in the UK, placing such offences on the same footing as terrorism and serious organised crime. The 230-page intelligence document outlining the crimes that pose the greatest threats to women and girls has been shared with all forces by the National Police Chiefs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Council (NPCC). The NPCC said it hoped the assessment would help forces better understand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the influences and levers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that contribute to the crimes. Campaigners welcomed the move on Thursday, but said it needed to come alongside far-reaching changes in policing itself before many women would feel able to trust the authorities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Violence against women and girls is rife and so many women we support tell us that they do not trust the police,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the head of policy at Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Aid, Lucy Hadley. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is important that violence against women and girls has been recognised as a strategic policing threat, however, Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Aid will hold forces to account for these promises: we need concrete action, not just rhetoric.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The new strategic threat and risk assessment of violence against women and girls (VAWG) is similar to the documents used by police tackling national threats such as terrorism and serious organised crime, the NPCC said. The offences it identifies as carrying the greatest threat to women are: Domestic abuse. Rape and serious sexual offences. Child sexual abuse and exploitation. Tech-enabled VAWG, such as online stalking and harassment. The NPCC said the document, which will be reassessed annually, did not contain analysis of police-perpetrated VAWG because that had been analysed separately as part of the performance report, which was published in March. It said some work based on that report was already under way and that it would include further insight into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153insider threat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in its next assessment. Hadley said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The strategic threat and risk assessment published today demonstrates the scale of change required \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the training and skills officers need, to investigations and protections for women, and of course the glaring issues of sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination within policing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pressing issue of tackling police perpetrators of violence against women and girls, and the severe problems with vetting and monitoring officers, are an urgent priority for improving trust and confidence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to hear from women who are too scared or distrustful to report because their perpetrator is a police officer; it remains essential that such cases are investigated by an independent force, or the Independent Office of Police Complaints, to ensure women can trust the process.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andrea Simon, the director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said she was pleased the threat was being taken seriously. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given we know that most victims of VAWG don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t report to the police at all, due to the poor and discriminatory treatment of women and marginalised communities, we know the true scale of VAWG is much higher than even what has been reported today. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If any of this is to improve, we first need better data on the experiences and justice outcomes of minoritised women, so that the police are accountable to those who are most harmed by their failings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The NPCC said it expected reporting of VAWG to continue to rise in the coming year. The deputy chief constable Maggie Blyth, the national policing coordinator for violence against women and girls, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The epidemic of VAWG that we are facing meant that it was imperative we took the time to analyse the greatest threats to women and girls.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/18/italy-disasters-floods-europe-climate-crisis", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disasters suggest the climate crisis is at the gates of Europe", "lead": "This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s floods are latest weather disaster to hit country, as policymakers finally begin to respond to crescendo", "author": "Damien Gayle Environment correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T17:41:34Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036417", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/775a0c6773db7b5cec7ea2dc7399462d6c537d64/0_0_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "This week, parts of northern Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Emilia-Romagna region received half their average annual rainfall in just 36 hours. Rivers burst their banks and thousands of acres of farmland lie submerged. By Thursday evening, an estimated 20,000 people had been left homeless and 13 were confirmed dead. It is just the latest weather disaster to hit the country. Six months ago, 12 people died on the southern island of Ischia in a landslide triggered by torrential rain. Eleven more were killed last September by flash floods in the central region of Marche. Last July, amid a heatwave and Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst drought for at least seven decades, an ice avalanche in the Italian Alps killed 11. It is too soon for an attribution study to determine how much worse, or more likely, this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s floods were made by human-caused global heating. But across Europe, as atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide increase, so too does extreme weather \u00e2\u20ac\u201c consecutive years of drought have afflicted farmers in Spain and southern France, while last year there were unprecedented heatwaves across the continent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Climate change is here and we are living the consequences. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t some remote prospect, it is the new normal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paola Pino d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Astore, an expert at the Italian Society of Environmental Geology (SIGEA), told Reuters. Experts say Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s geography makes it particularly vulnerable to climate disasters: its varied geology make it prone to floods and landslides, while rapidly warming seas either side make it vulnerable to increasingly powerful storms, amid rising temperatures. The frontlines of the climate crisis have hitherto been in the global south, leading to the oft-repeated refrain that those least responsible for the climate crisis are facing the worst effects. But for Italy now, and probably soon the rest of Europe, the enemy is at the gates. Last August, a weather station near Syracuse on the southern island of Sicily recorded 48.8C, which is thought to be the highest temperature ever measured in Europe. While the world fights a losing battle to keep the increase in global average temperatures below 1.5C, in Italy average temperatures over the past 10 years are already 2.1C higher than in pre-industrial times. Coldiretti, a national farmers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 group, says the number of extreme weather events recorded last summer, including tornadoes, giant hail stones and lightning strikes, was five times the number registered a decade ago. And, like in many parts of the world already feeling the impacts of climate breakdown, it is farmers suffering the most: last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s severe drought caused crop yields to fall by up to 45%. The environmental group WWF Italia said the elimination of water-absorbing forests and vegetation along riverbanks in Emilia-Romagna had amplified this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disaster. Twenty three rivers burst their banks. Experts say it is the result of years of often unregulated building and industrial-scale agriculture. Despite the crescendo of extreme weather disasters, Italian policymakers are only just beginning to intervene. The environment ministry published the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change in December 2022 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after almost four years of delay. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A climate change adaptation policy that goes beyond how to handle emergencies and considers the effects of ordinary planning is increasingly urgent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd WWF Italia said in a statement."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/18/chelsea-ruben-loftus-cheek-milan-aaron-ramsdale-arsenal-contract", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Chelsea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ruben Loftus-Cheek a target for Milan and keen to make move", "lead": "Milan are in talks to sign Ruben Loftus-Cheek from Chelsea and the midfielder is keen on the move as he searches for a fresh start away from his boyhood club", "author": "Fabrizio Romano", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T17:38:43Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036420", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a5c4b5a546f33e11402367ea25cf909d3b4be1ef/30_398_2845_1706/500.jpg", "body": "Milan are in talks to sign Ruben Loftus-Cheek from Chelsea and the midfielder is keen on the move as he searches for a fresh start away from his boyhood club.

What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more, you can see what he means. While a full-year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adjusted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd operating loss of \u00c2\u00a3419m at Royal Mail is nobody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea of a comfortable outcome, the number was no worse than advertised in January, which is something. Meanwhile, after a year of strife and strikes, a deal on pay and working practices has been agreed with the leadership of the Communication Workers Union. The union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s members have yet to vote on the proposal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and some on social media sound less than enthused \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but one assumes it will get over the line. The looming exit of the unpopular Royal Mail boss, Simon Thompson, may even be good for a few votes. Plain sailing from here, then? Not quite. Royal Mail still has to secure the operational gains from the deal with the CWU, and targeted savings have had a habit of not materialising fully. The planned return to operating profit, ignoring voluntary redundancy costs, in the 2024-25 financial year is not secure yet. But, yes, the position definitely looks better than it was two months ago. Do not, though, overlook two other factors that were subplots to the industrial dispute and have the potential to turn explosive in time. Neither has disappeared. First, Williams made clear on Thursday that the idea of breaking up International Distributions Services (IDS), as the parent company is now known, is still on the table. In other words, GLS, the successful Amsterdam-based international parcels operator, could still be demerged to leave Royal Mail as a standalone company. IDS could pitch a demerger as a plain-vanilla proposal since companies demerge all the time and GLS is Dutch, but, in practice, life probably would not be so straightforward. Political aggro in the UK would be the way to bet. Darren Jones, the Labour chair of the business select committee, was on the radio only this week sounding unhappy about the degree of internal separation and limits on cross-subsidy from GLS (profit-making to the tune of \u00c2\u00a3348m last year) to Royal Mail that has already taken place. After a demerger, note, GLS would be free to compete in the UK against Royal Mail and its Parcelforce unit. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear what IDS would regard as a trigger for a spin-off (the persistence of a mediocre share price?), but until it makes its intentions clear, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an issue that will bubble in the background. The other potential battle is one where the group definitely knows what it wants: it thinks the Universal Service Obligation (USO), the requirement on Royal Mail to deliver letters six days a week to every address in the land if necessary, needs reform. And it surely has a point. The USO, in its current form, was designed in an era before the volume of letters plunged, and many other European countries have watered down their equivalent regimes. About 97% of users in Ofcom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last survey said their postal needs would be met by a five-day-a-week letter service (Saturday would be the day dropped). And the savings, last estimated by the regulator to be \u00c2\u00a3125m-\u00c2\u00a3225m, might be usefully recycled in strengthening the parcel-related provisions of the USO. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problem, though, is that only parliament can change the USO, and the government has said it has no current plans, while Labour has said next to nothing. Royal Mail is also poorly placed to plead for relief while its reported delivery standards, now being investigated by Ofcom, are so far short of the mark. Sooner or later, though, the USO issue will come centre stage. Royal Mail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corporate life is not about to become dull."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2023/may/18/the-guardian-view-on-northern-irelands-elections-a-pivotal-moment", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "The Guardian view on Northern Ireland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections: a pivotal moment | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voting could have consequences for power-sharing and for Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to rebuild credibility in Europe", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T17:28:21Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036429", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/779911eee8771bca24c0affa34b9365523975781/0_103_5619_3371/500.jpg", "body": "All politics is local, or so it used to be said. But there was not much sign of that supposed neighbourhood granularity in England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local elections on 4 May. Instead, a majority of English voters appear to have gone to the polls determined to register a national protest against Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conservative government at Westminster. There has been even less deference to the parish pump in this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s local elections in Northern Ireland. The 11 so-called super district councils, all proportionally elected, were up for grabs on Thursday for only the third time since the reform of local government in 2014. However, the Northern Ireland campaign has been overwhelmingly focused on a bigger political picture too, in this case the future of power sharing at Stormont and the wider tensions caused by Brexit. None of this should imply that the Northern Ireland elections do not matter, despite an extremely lacklustre campaign. The results, which are due to be announced on Friday and Saturday, will at least produce local councils that are able to carry out their government functions in spite of the standoff at Stormont. Local democracy of that kind remains genuinely important. The results will also be studied, as ever, for what they say about the balances of political power within and between the two main traditions in Northern Ireland. They may also have something important to say about the health of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third tradition, the non-aligned. This group may outpoll both unionists and nationalists this week, yet it is blocked by the Democratic Unionist party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boycott of power sharing from putting its willingness to govern into practice. There can be no denying that these elections have also been a proxy referendum on the long stalemate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now lasting for more than two years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c caused by the DUP boycott. When the Windsor framework of amendments to the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol was agreed between Mr Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UK government and the European Union in February, the DUP refused to be stampeded into acceptance. This gave way to a tacit acceptance in London and Brussels that nothing would move on the issue until the local elections were out of the way. That point, however, has now been reached. Those who hoped that the completion of the campaign would allow a page to be turned could be in for a disappointment. If the DUP puts in a commanding performance among unionist voters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which polls suggest is unlikely \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the party will see the result as an endorsement of its hardline abstentionism and ramp up its demand for changes to the framework. But if the DUP does really badly, it will have little incentive to limp back into the power-sharing institutions in the shadow of Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in, which is predicted to be a big winner this week. This is therefore a pivotal moment for the credibility of the power-sharing institutions created by the Good Friday agreement, whose quarter century brought Joe Biden and many others to Northern Ireland last month. It is also a pivotal moment in Mr Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tentative attempts to rebuild other post-Brexit relationships with the EU. The Windsor framework was a necessary down payment to facilitate other agreements, like solving the car industry crisis that has been so dramatically highlighted this week. Now this too is in doubt. The uncomfortable truth is that, whatever the results this week, the DUP has its hand around the throat not just of Northern Ireland, but of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relationship with Europe."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2023/may/18/the-guardian-view-on-american-chinese-relations-looking-beyond-governments", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "The Guardian view on American-Chinese relations: looking beyond governments | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing imperil contact between citizens, but also make it more important", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T17:28:02Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036435", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ff60f884bc084409a12e727caceff6978535f7d6/21_358_3684_2210/500.jpg", "body": "Richer and more complex stories lie behind dominant narratives, as the British Museum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fascinating new exhibition, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hidden Century, reminds us.

As the American and Chinese scholars Scott Kennedy and Wang Jisi warn in a recent report on academic exchange, Breaking the Ice: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Less connectivity is not only a product of worsening ties, it also has contributed to the decline of relations ... A rise in estrangement reinforced fears about the other side\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motives.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gallup says that the proportion of Americans with a favourable view of China has plummeted from 38% in 2018 to just 15% this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a record low. While it is extremely hard to gauge public opinion in China, the business intelligence firm Morning Consult says it found that 66% of adults saw the US as an enemy or unfriendly, while 64% of Americans believed the same of China. A decade ago, 15,000 Americans were studying in China; in the 2020-21 academic year there were just 382. (The US has seen a less dramatic decline in Chinese students.) Severe pandemic restrictions were primarily responsible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but numbers were already dropping, and there is little confidence that they will return to anywhere near the old levels. China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detention of two Canadians after Ottawa arrested Huawei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, at the behest of the US, its sanctioning of academics over criticisms of human rights abuses in Xinjiang and the introduction of Hong Kong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s draconian national security law have made scholars and others understandably reluctant to travel there. Even businesses, which have often sought to push back against tougher US action, are having second thoughts. Economic stagnation and governmental attempts to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153derisk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd supply chains are key, but recent raids at high-profile consulting firms that help foreign businesses assess investments have highlighted concerns about staff safety. On the US side, the surge in anti-Asian hate, the targeting of Chinese scholars for scrutiny and now state legislation banning or restricting land purchases by Chinese nationals have all made it less attractive. Dr Kennedy and Prof Wang note that non-governmental exchanges are necessary though not sufficient to stabilise ties, and urge both sides to restore connections \u00e2\u20ac\u0153across the entire span of the two societies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The aim is laudable. It will, however, be extremely hard to realise. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Last-minute restrictions to the numbers of NGOs attending what the head of Unep described as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most important multilateral environmental deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a decade will exclude people from communities in developing countries harmed by dumping and burning of plastic waste as well as marginalised waste pickers, who are crucial to recycling, from fully participating, they said. The groups criticised the agency for publishing a report this week, before negotiations between 193 countries over 29 May to 2 June, which they claimed did not fully reflect the health and environmental effects of plastic pollution. The report said mismanaged plastic waste could be slashed by 80% by 2040. Scientists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty (Scept), representing 200 scientists who were invited to comment before the report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s publication, said their concerns and criticisms were ignored. Unep said it regretted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153due to a technical issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an email containing Scept comments was not received in time for publication. However, it said it received feedback from 75 experts from 39 organisations that were incorporated. It denied claims its report did not sufficiently reflect the health and environmental impacts of plastic. Rich Gower, a senior economist for Tearfund, an international NGO that provides advocacy and support to waste pickers, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This last-minute restriction locks out those who most need to be heard. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital that negotiators hear from those with firsthand experience of plastic pollution: waste pickers, communities harmed by dumping and burning, and those living near toxic production plants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without these groups\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 voices the treaty will fail to be the life-changing instrument we desperately need it to be.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Tearfund partner and campaigner Tiwonge Mzumara-Gawa, from Malawi, who will now share a pass with four colleagues after NGOs were told only one in five people would have access to negotiations, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153World leaders must hear real stories from people in countries where the plastics treaty could have a life-changing impact. In Malawi we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have organised public waste collection and many people are forced to either dump or burn their waste. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely disappointing that my colleagues and I will now have much less access to these talks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Therese Karlsson, a science adviser at International Pollutants Elimination Network and member of Scept, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were asked to review the report. Thirty scientists provided over 300 comments. We have several major concerns, one around the framing of the report, which is very focused on technological solutions in a very optimistic way, even although those technical solutions are not proven.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This creates a narrative that makes is easy to think we can fix our way out of this. But we need to talk about chemicals from plastics and decrease the use of plastics.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One concern, she said, was the inclusion of chemical recycling, which was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not recognised as environmentally sound management\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd under the Basel convention, as a possible interim solution. Bethanie Carney Almroth, a professor of toxicology at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden and a member of Scept, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For a group that have called on scientists, they have locked us out of the room and they have not registered our criticisms.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Andr\u00c3\u00a9s Del Castillo, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The headline figure of the Unep report predicts an 80% reduction of plastics pollution with the proposed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew plastics economy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This number does not represent a reduction, but rather a narrowing of the scope and definition of what is considered plastic pollution from a full life cycle perspective.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reduction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which refers to a decrease in plastic waste into the environment, did not count other elements of plastic pollution, such as upstream greenhouse gas emissions and toxic emissions, he said. NGOs have expressed concern over the report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inclusion of burning plastic waste in cement kilns as one of several strategies to address the plastics crisis. Dr Neil Tangri, the science and policy director at Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Burning plastic waste in cement kilns is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcget out of jail free card\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for the plastic industry to keep ramping up plastic production by claiming that the plastic problem can be simply burned away.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesperson for Unep said NGOs were informed at registration that the venue, which has a capacity of 1,500, had space constraints. However, 640 or 40% of attendees were from NGOs, it said. It denied claims its report insufficiently considered the health and environmental impacts of plastic pollution. It said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A large part of the economic costs associated with plastics pollution, assessed at the outset of the report, are due to human health impacts \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well over one-third of the estimated $300bn a year costs stemming from plastic pollution are related to exposure to hazardous chemicals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The report builds on this evidence to call for the need to completely transform the plastics economy. On waste management the report proposes changes that affect the whole life cycle, from raw materials extraction and processing, with a significant focus on design needs (design of both products and systems), use and reuse, and indeed highlighting the importance of strengthening waste collection and management.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unep denied the report presented chemical recycling and cement kilns burning plastic as fuel as part of the solution to plastics problem, saying they were simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153options when safe disposal facilities are to be used as a last resort to avoid plastic leaking into the environment and stresses the needs for emissions (and/or effluent) control and standards to assure safety. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The potential lock-in effect of purpose-built facilities such as incinerators and plastic-to-fuel plants is highlighted as something to be avoided,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/18/two-teenage-boys-life-sentences-stabbing-khayri-mclean-boy-15-death-huddersfield", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Khayri Mclean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother calls for end to knife violence after boys sentenced to life", "lead": "Charlie Mclean says she has lost a child and parents of teenage murderers have lost two sons", "author": "Mark Brown North of England correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T17:14:59Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036445", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/37d82fe11f54a773098595512a98e200c5bb5979/0_87_3000_1801/500.jpg", "body": "A mother has called for an end to teenage knife violence after two boys who murdered her 15-year-old son on his way home from school were given life sentences. Khayri Mclean was murdered as he walked with friends in Huddersfield at 2.50pm on 21 September last year. Cousins Jakele Pusey, 15, and Jovani Harriott, 17, had changed into black clothes and black balaclavas and were hiding, waiting to ambush him. Leeds crown court was played CCTV footage of them leaping out and stabbing Khayri before running away. Khayri was helped to his feet by his friends and started making his way back to school, but collapsed. Classes had ended and children were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153teeming out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as he lay bleeding on the pavement, the court heard. He was helped by a passing doctor and paramedics and was taken to hospital in Leeds, but died two and a half hours later. Sentencing the boys, Mrs Justice Farbey said she was not clear what the motivation was, but it may have been gang-related. The prosecutor Jonathan Sandiford KC suggested the motive was revenge. In a pre-sentence report, Jovani refers to a friend of Khayri\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breaking a window at his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house. Sandiford said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reason for targeting Khayri was that he had shared a video of that incident on social media.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jakele, who struck the fatal blow to Khayri\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chest, admitted murder. He was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years. Jovani, who stabbed Khayri in the leg, had denied murder, but was found guilty by a jury. He was sentenced to a minimum of 18 years. The court was read a victim impact statement from Charlie Mclean, Khayri\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, who described her son as a Manchester United fan who enjoyed playing rugby league. He wanted to be an engineer when he was older, she said. Khayri had been helpless when he was attacked, she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fear he went through when he realised he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been stabbed and was bleeding to death will stay with me for ever. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never got to say goodbye. I am living a nightmare. I can hardly function and I have changed as a person. When I wake up, on the occasions I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve managed to sleep, it hits me like a tonne of bricks again and again. I am in tears on a daily basis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said she asks herself what has been achieved by her son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What has my son died for? Nobody has won in this situation. I have lost a child and other parents have lost two sons. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This violence has to stop, carrying weapons has to stop. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lost my son. I would not wish this upon anyone else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jovani has denied being part of a gang, or that the murder of Khayri was gang-related. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153However, the crown submits those contentions are at odds both with the very nature of the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sandiford. He said the attack was premeditated and carefully planned, and involved the use of another schoolboy as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spotter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The court heard Jakele was shot by masked men in a gang incident when he was 12. He has flashbacks and nightmares and lost two years of schooling. His family had recently been evicted and he was living in a hotel. Jakele admitted to probation officers that he had a history of gang-related criminality. A report concluded that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153violence against opposing gang members was the norm \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the life he lived\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The defence counsel Mohammed Nawaz KC said his client Jovani was proving to be a model student in detention. He had has shown \u00e2\u20ac\u0153genuine and real remorse for this event\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Family and friends of Khayri sat in the jury box for the sentencing hearing on Thursday wearing matching T-shirts featuring his photo. The defendants have previously not been named because of their age. An application for anonymity orders to be lifted was granted following submissions from the Press Association and the BBC. The judge said the principles of open justice outweighed welfare arguments for the two defendants, both from Huddersfield. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Khayri was murdered, aged 15, in a public street near a school at the end of the school day when schoolchildren came teeming out. There is a strong public interest in the full reporting of a murder so close to a school.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Det Supt Marc Bowes, of West Yorkshire police, who led the investigation, said it was a crime that had shocked people across the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be hard for many of us to comprehend how what appears to have been a relatively low-level dispute has resulted in these males stabbing a fellow student to death at the end of an otherwise ordinary school day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/18/rmt-to-hold-rail-strike-across-england-on-eve-of-fa-cup-final", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "RMT to hold rail strike across England on eve of FA Cup final", "lead": "Latest action on 2 June comes between two days of strikes by Aslef and will bring further disruption to football final", "author": "Gwyn Topham Transport correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T17:05:27Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036448", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/05d96dcfd2e678cf9ef80043784e470f1fe962d3/964_801_3416_2050/500.jpg", "body": "The RMT has announced another rail strike on Friday 2 June, the day before the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FA Cup final, warning that the government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot wish the dispute away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. About 20,000 RMT members working for the 14 major rail companies in England will strike for 24 hours in the long-running dispute over pay and conditions. The stoppage falls between two days of strikes already called by the drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 union, Aslef, on 31 May and 3 June, compounding the disruption for passengers before the final at Wembley between Manchester City and Manchester United on the Saturday. The union said that while there had been contact with the train operators\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 body, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), since the last strike was called, there had been no new proposals. The package rejected in April had not significantly improved since the offer was rejected in February, a headline increase of 9% over two years but with conditions attached and only a short-term guarantee against job cuts. Train managers, catering crew and station staff in the RMT will go on strike. It is likely to have less overall impact on trains than the Aslef action, or earlier RMT strikes including Network Rail staff, but will significantly disrupt most services around England and some cross-border services into Scotland and Wales. The RMT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general secretary, Mick Lynch, blamed the government for refusing to allow rail negotiators to make an offer it could consider. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ministers cannot just wish this dispute away. They underestimate the strength of feeling among our members, who have just given us a new six-month strike mandate, continue to support the campaign and the action, and are determined to see this through until we get an acceptable resolution. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government now needs to unlock the RDG and allow them to make an offer that can be put to a referendum of our members.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An RDG spokesperson said it stood by its last offer, which it said was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agreed line by line with their negotiating team, which would have resolved this dispute and given our lowest paid staff a rise of up to 13%\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By calling more strike action the RMT leadership have chosen to prolong this dispute without ever giving their members a chance to have a say on their own offer. Instead, they will be subject to yet more lost pay through industrial action, customers will suffer more disruption, and the industry will continue to suffer huge damage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The RDG said it was willing to continue talks.

The 12-page reading test, featuring three substantial texts followed by 38 questions to be answered in an hour, was published on Thursday, once the assessment window had closed. The paper, which was sat last week by 10- and 11-year-old pupils in year 6 in England, was widely criticised by teachers and parents, who complained it was too difficult. Even children who excelled in practice papers were unable to finish. The paper was originally due to be released on Monday but was brought forward to Thursday \u00e2\u20ac\u0153due to public interest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Utterly miserable, scary and quite middle class\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was the verdict of Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson, the headteacher of Anderton Park primary school in Birmingham. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of my kids, English is not their first language, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re strong readers. They devour books, and yet this is how they will be judged,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said, with undisguised disappointment. Much of the content of the set texts was totally unfamiliar, she said. Many pupils could not finish in the allotted hour, some were reduced to tears, and it was not just the children who were confounded. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of my year 5 teachers said they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know what a sheep rustler is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you have some background knowledge of the subject, of course it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to put you at an advantage,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continued Hewitt-Clarkson, who said she was almost certain that none of her children had ever been camping. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve probably never seen a bat and they have certainly never been to Austin, Texas,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where, according to the second set text in the paper, more than a million bats live under the Congress Avenue Bridge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How utterly ridiculous,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said of the Bats Under the Bridge text, which was adapted from a 2016 New York Times article, A Summer Evening in Texas Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Complete Without a Bat Show, by JoAnna Klein. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That a text aimed at 10- and 11-year-olds is taken from something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s adult readership level. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We work so hard in schools finding fiction, nonfiction, poetry that are really interesting and diverse and inclusive, so our children can see themselves in texts, but there was nothing of that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a Royal Shakespeare Company associate school, Hewitt-Clarkson said her children were exposed to Shakespeare from nursery up, so it was not a question of the school shying away from difficult texts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there are not any year 6 teachers in the land who would have chosen those texts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added. Simon Kidwell, the principal of Hartford Manor primary school in Cheshire, complained the paper was too long. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The concern we have is the number of words in the paper this year, which were 35% more in the reading booklet than the previous year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first experience of a formal test at the age of 10 and 11, and if they have a poor experience, that can affect the rest of their school career in terms of their attitudes towards tests.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kidwell, who is the vice-president of the National Association of Head Teachers, was also concerned about the sequencing of the questions. Normally tests begin with easier questions to help children settle down, and gradually get harder. This paper, he said, opened with three more challenging questions, which required children to infer and explain, rather than simply retrieve answers from the text. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had a couple of children who got upset because they did not finish. And from parent feedback, children went home and did not think they had done very well. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knocked their confidence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The schools minister, Nick Gibb, has said he plans to look at the paper, after complaints from schools. Gillian Hillier, the chief executive of the Standards and Testing Agency, which developed the Sats tests over three years, said they had been trialled on thousands of pupils. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All the tests are mapped to the key stage 2 curriculum and information from the trials and reviews is used to ensure that each test is of similar difficulty to those in previous years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The first text about Priya and her friends camping near a farm was taken from Survival Squad: Night Riders (Book 3), an adventure book by Jonathan Rock. The third extract was taken from The Rise of Wolves, a mystery adventure by Kerr Thomson about a boy called Innis Munro on the island of Nin. QUESTIONS CHILDREN FOUND DIFFICULT Question: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She wriggled back inside the tent \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 What does this tell you about how Priya got inside the tent? Tick one. She ran quickly inside. She jumped through the flap. She had to squeeze in. She crept in quietly. Answer: She had to squeeze in, but teachers said many children chose she crept in quietly, which they felt was also valid. Question: In which American state is the Congress Avenue Bridge found? Relevant extract: By day the Congress Avenue Bridge in the city of Austin could hardly look more normal: a grey, dreary city-centre road bridge. By night, it plays host to one of the most amazing shows nature has to offer. The underside of the bridge is home to more than a million bats, and every evening in summer they all come swarming out at once, rising up into the city sky like a tornado before spreading out in all directions like plumes of smoke. Standing on the bridge, you might even feel the wind from their wings as they pass by. Austin is the capital city of the state of Texas in the USA, but it is also the bat capital of North America. The bats under the bridge attract thousands of visitors every year, and every August lovers celebrate Bat Fest on the bridge in their honour. Answer: Texas but many children, unfamiliar with the US states, put Austin."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/18/british-baby-cultural-marxism-conservatives-parenthood", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "The great British baby drought has a simple cause.

There is nothing rightwing about having children and raising them well, but her rightwing government has done everything it can to punish parenthood. Families can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manage on one income and childcare is astronomically expensive: the OECD says UK parents spend a third of their wages on it, double the average for western economies. The young are worse off than their parents were at baby-producing age, with higher rents and, lower incomes and burdened with debt. Very few under-35s can buy homes, unless they have parents to help. Yet there is no shortage of those who want more children: the tragedy is that so many are prevented from having children they long for, as the Social Market Foundation (SMF) reports in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Baby bust and baby boom: Examining the liberal case for pronatalism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Just as abortion is an absolute right, so should bearing children be a right. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as if they would choose large families, but possibly just enough for the 2.1-per-woman replacement rate. In a decade, the birthrate in England and Wales fell from 1.93 in 2011 to 1.61 in 2021, according to the latest figures available. But anti-natalist Conservative policy bars benefits to more than two children in a family on universal credit: those families, mostly in work, lose \u00c2\u00a32,800 for a third child, impoverishing 1.3 million children. Those babies (yes, from hard-working non-graduate families) get no mention from Cates. Indeed, when the Daily Mail reported on the baby drought, that familiar anti-baby Tory attitude spewed out in the Mail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment thread below: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, the usuals on state support will still churn them out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of those with children, shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Jeremy Kyles, the newcomers and deadbeat dads knock them out like there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no tomorrow, largely at others\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 expense\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with plenty of disgusting racism. The SMF warns falling fertility rates mean \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long-term economic stagnation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the ratio of workers to pensioners shrinks, to 3.5 retirees for every 10 workers by the next decade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Low fertility rates are set to shrink the workforce, stifle demand and slow innovation, suppressing GDP growth and stretching the public finances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That point about innovation is vital: if you think the environment requires fewer babies, be warned that an elderly conservative population wooed by the right cares less about the future than a society defined by the dynamism and social concerns of youth. The SMF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remedies for the baby bust include payments to parents, better parental leave and cheaper childcare with Whitehall officials adopting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153population test\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for every policy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effect on the birthrate. France, always pro-natalist, has a grant of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac950 (\u00c2\u00a3825) for each newborn, and a much higher birthrate. If Cates was serious, she would look at what worked, right here. When Labour inherited a falling birthrate in 1997, it welcomed babies with 3,500 Sure Start centres, free nursery education, childcare tax credits and a child trust fund endowing every newborn. Schools were rebuilt, education maintenance grants helped keep poor children in the sixth-form and wraparound breakfast and tea clubs in many schools made life easier for working parents. Good enough? No, but it was the beginning of a celebration of babies and childhood. What happened next? Two years after the Tories took power the birthrate began to plunge again, with George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity especially targeted on children and families. The number of babies born in 2019 fell a startling 12.2% from 2012. So we know how to make babies. And it has nothing to do with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cultural Marxism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The first match of the ban is effective immediately, meaning Klopp will be in the stands for Liverpool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final home game of the season, against Aston Villa on Saturday, while the second is suspended until the end of the 2023-24 season on condition he does not repeat the breach. Klopp must also cover the costs of the independent regulatory commission that heard the case on top of his \u00c2\u00a375,000 fine. Klopp celebrated Diogo Jota\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s injury-time winner by running up to the fourth official, John Brooks. The 55-year-old\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour then earned him a yellow card but did not give rise to the charge although his poor disciplinary record was taken into consideration for the sanction. Klopp \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who has appeared before commissions three times in the past five years and was banned and warned about his behaviour as recently as November \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been told any further breaches will result in more disciplinary action. The Liverpool manager accused Tierney of being biased against the club, and/or himself, in an immediate post-match interview with Sky Sports. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have our story, history with Mr Tierney. I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what this man has with us, I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 always will say there is nothing, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true.

I am really not sure if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s me because how he looks at me, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Klopp had also claimed that what Tierney said to him when showing the yellow card for racing up to Brooks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was not OK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The commission revealed a transcript of the exchange that led to Klopp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s booking. Brooks: J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Klopp has just run and celebrated in my face. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a yellow card mate, minimum. VAR: Confirming yellow card. Confirming yellow card J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Klopp. Paul Tierney: Right \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I have to show you yellow. It could be red, but I am going to show you yellow. He said yellow. We will give you the benefit of the doubt, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything more. The FA described Klopp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly improper and simply irresponsible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a particularly serious example of misconduct involving media comments about a match official.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It accepted Klopp had shown genuine regret in the aftermath and was proactive in addressing the matter at his next press conference and quick to admit the charge. In a letter submitted three days after the Spurs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 game, Klopp said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am sorry for my reaction in that immediate moment when I ran towards the fourth official, Mr Brooks, and I fully accepted a caution was justified. Equally I am sorry for some of the tone and content of my post-match interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although it was not my intention I accept now it appears that I was questioning Mr Tierney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s integrity.

Although not an excuse, I believe we have made up a high percentage of Mr Tierney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s matches this season? Something in the region of 20% of the matches he has officiated have involved my team. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do not offer this as a defence, rather it is an observation and could be a reason for both the buildup of frustration governed by an inadvertent accumulation of incidents over an extended period.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/may/18/daily-express-editor-gary-jones-was-involved-in-phone-hacking-court-hears", "primaryCategory": "media", "title": "Daily Express editor Gary Jones was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinvolved in phone hacking\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, court hears", "lead": "Current editor was prolific user of private investigators while working at News of the World and Daily Mirror, ex-reporter claims", "author": "Jim Waterson Media editor", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T16:46:55Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036473", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cf0b6e3603c1d079917e997b48e84fec45e438aa/1289_1035_4371_2622/500.jpg", "body": "The current editor of the Daily Express was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153involved in phone hacking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and other illegal activity in the 1990s and 2000s, the high court has been told. The trial of Prince Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phone-hacking claim heard on Thursday that Gary Jones was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a prolific user of private investigators\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while working at the News of the World and Daily Mirror. Although the court has heard allegations against many former editors, including Piers Morgan, this is the first time during this trial that a serving national newspaper editor has been accused of involvement in phone hacking. Graham Johnson, a former Sunday Mirror reporter, told the court that hundreds of people at Mirror Group Newspapers were involved in a cover-up of illegal behaviour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an investigation into an organised crime group, which is Mirror Group Newspapers. I investigated drug gangs in Liverpool, fraud factories in south-east London, and street gangs in Birmingham. The Mirror Group is no different from an organised crime group in that respect. This is a true crime story.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He claimed that Jones, who has been editor of the Daily Express since it was bought by the Mirror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company in 2018, handled hacked material relating to Sadie Frost while working as a reporter for the Daily Mirror. Johnson said Jones \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was a prolific user of private investigators\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and was also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153involved in phone hacking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while working with Greg Miskiw, who commissioned hundreds of hacks at the News of the World. Jones worked for Morgan at the News of the World in the mid-1990s, before following his boss to the Daily Mirror. Jones became a regular client of Southern Investigations, the private investigation firm heavily linked to police corruption and the unsolved murder of Daniel Morgan, allegedly using them to obtain Prince Michael of Kent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bank records. Johnson told the court it was noteworthy that Jones has not been called as a defence witness by the Mirror: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153None of these people will give evidence and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to know why. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like Mirror Group to answer that question. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to know why Piers Morgan isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t here to give evidence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked for comment on the allegation that the Daily Express editor once engaged in illegal activity, a spokesperson for Mirror Group Newspapers said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Where historical wrongdoing has taken place, we have made admissions, take full responsibility and apologise unreservedly, but we will vigorously defend against allegations of wrongdoing where our journalists acted lawfully.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prince Harry and more than 100 other claimants are suing Mirror Group Newspapers, alleging that the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror, and People engaged in widespread illegal behaviour and then covered up the evidence. Andrew Green KC, the Mirror\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barrister, suggested that Johnson, who made the allegations against Jones, was not an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153objective and independent witness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because he was working closely with the lawyers for Prince Harry and the other claimants. Johnson is a self-confessed phone hacker who accepts that he regularly commissioned illegal acts and fabricated stories while working as a tabloid journalist during the 1990s and 2000s. He was sacked from the News of the World after claiming he had found evidence of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beast of Bodmin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a mythical wild beast, on the loose in Devon. In reality he had photographed a tame puma in a wildlife park and carved scratch marks into a tree. The journalist said he realised the error of his ways after reading a philosophy book by Alain de Botton and had since dedicated himself to exposing wrongdoing in the media. Green told the court that Johnson had paid tens of thousands of pounds to people who made allegations of illegal behaviour at newspapers. The Mirror raised doubts about the source of this money, suggesting Johnson was not an independent journalist but a campaigner working in collaboration with the lawyers for the claimants. Johnson responded: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not objective and independent, in as much as I think it is wrong for organised crime to take place at your newspaper and other newspapers. I am very happy to help the victims of the organised crime at Mirror Group.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The court also heard evidence from the convicted private investigator Steve Whittamore, who said he illegally obtained records on behalf of Daily Mirror journalists and used the email address blag2049@hotmail.com. The court heard that his clients at the newspaper included Tom Newton Dunn, now a presenter on TalkTV, who was invoiced for identifying an individual based on a mobile phone number."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/18/peter-jones-obituary", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "title": "Peter Jones obituary", "lead": "<strong>Other lives</strong>: Artist and creator of Colourscape walk-in installations visited by thousands across the UK", "author": "Lynne Dickens", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T16:44:09Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036476", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/94422d6425ebe15f71f7e8255c49f73bb877ab15/0_104_788_473/500.jpg", "body": "My husband, Peter Jones, who has died aged 83, was a prolific artist of colour and light, best known for his Colourscape walk-in installations, each a series of interlinked chambers of translucent PVC, creating space with pure colour. He was also a mathematician and hang-glider pilot, and interested in science, meditation and spirituality. Following studies in the early 1960s at St Martin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s School of Art in London \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where he was influenced by the De Stijl movement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Peter made architectural constructions, which he termed Spaceplaces, within buildings and galleries, using coloured panels and rods. Working with his fellow artist Maurice Agis, he had shows at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and at the Stedelijk, Amsterdam, and in 1967 they jointly won the Netherlands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Sikkens prize for use of colour. They continued to collaborate until 1977. Wanting his art to be accessible to a wider audience, Peter began to work outside. He realised the powerful effect of daylight transmitted through primary-coloured material and experimented with air-inflated, interconnected domes that people went inside. He called this installation Spaceplace, Towards a Colour Village, and it was first exhibited outside the Serpentine Gallery, London, in 1971, followed by 25 shows touring the UK over three years. His work evolved in 1974 into Colourscape, with a long-running show at Battersea Park, London, in 1977 and 1978, as well as on Blackheath and in other parts of the UK. Peter and I met in the mid 1970s and became partners in 1977 (we married in 2011), moving to Wales the following year where we collaborated on much larger Colourscapes. Thirty-five structures were made by 2012, showing every year in the UK and internationally. Colourscapes have been visited by many thousands of people, the immersion in colour providing intense perceptual and emotional experiences. In 1989 we formed a partnership with the composers Simon Desorgher and Lawrence Casserly, creating the Colourscape music festivals and receiving commissions from the Arts Council. Together we developed the 1995 Colourscape of 100 chambers, Peter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest work, incorporating a cathedral-like performance space, where orchestras, dancers and musicians led the public on an extraordinary journey. This has continued annually on Clapham Common, in south London, and elsewhere. Other work involved making large geodesic spheres for performance, designing installations of colour and sound specifically for children with special educational needs, and developing experimental projects at Aberystwyth Arts Centre. Peter was born in Hilsea, Portsmouth, to Dorothy (nee Walters), who worked as a cashier in a butcher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shop, and Charles Jones, an RAF engineer. The family moved several times before setting in London where Peter went to Harrow grammar school and then Welbeck college in Leicestershire for the sixth form.

For decades the Gateways, a dingy basement off Kings Road, Chelsea, was the only place in London where lesbians could meet and be themselves. Dusty Springfield, Patricia Highsmith, Maggi Hambling and Sandi Toksvig all went there, as did I. The club was the setting for Maureen Duffy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1966 novel The Microcosm and was depicted in the 1968 Hollywood movie The Killing of Sister George. I first met Jill at the Foyles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 launch of her book in 2003. She published it under the pseudonym Jill Gardiner, out of deference to her parents who disdained the subject matter. Her mother, Elizabeth (nee Taylor), was a deputy head teacher, her father, Norman Longmate, a social historian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He had mistresses. She had God,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jill wrote of them. Jill was born in Kingston upon Thames, south London, and went to Richmond county school for girls. Like her mother, Jill read history at Somerville College, Oxford, then taught. She was head of politics at Haywards Heath College in the 1990s, wrote Women and Politics: Progress without Power? (1997) for the Politics Association and acquired a clutch of other degrees. Only after she settled in Brighton in 1983 did she feel able to be openly lesbian, immersing herself in the local scene. In 1992 she co-edited Daring Hearts: Lesbian and Gay Lives of 50s and 60s Brighton. Though Jill chronicled the lives of contemporary lesbians, her persona was Bloomsbury. Even indoors she wore a trademark wide-brimmed hat of the Vita Sackville-West sort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she was seldom seen bareheaded. She kept a daily diary, her emails to friends were the length of old-fashioned letters and Charleston was a favoured literary festival. She became chair of Brighton Poets in 1994. Her own love poems, With Some Wild Women: Poems 1989-2019, are romantic, whimsical and wayward. At the time of her death Jill was well into the writing of a biography of Duffy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with Maureen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cooperation. This unfinished work will be housed at King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College London. Jill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gateways research will go to the Bishopsgate Institute in London and her personal papers will be held at the Keep, a historical resource centre in Brighton. Her wide-brimmed floppy hat went with her into her grave. A legion of female friends became Jill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cherished family. She is survived by her partner of 31 years."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/18/lucy-letby-says-poisoning-of-two-babies-with-insulin-was-not-by-her-court-hears", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Lucy Letby tells court poisoning of two babies with insulin was not by her", "lead": "Nurse claims she was blamed by \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgang of four\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 consultants for alleged attacks on Child F and L at Countess of Chester hospital", "author": "Helen Pidd North of England editor", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T16:33:00Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036482", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/14666693782c348a511ea1af7be0078bd2399111/0_228_2016_1210/500.jpg", "body": "Lucy Letby, the nurse on trial for murdering babies in her care, has told a jury that two babies were deliberately poisoned with insulin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not by her. The premature babies, identified as Child F and L, both survived the alleged attacks at Countess of Chester hospital. Under cross-examination at Manchester crown court on Thursday, Letby also told a jury that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gang of four\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd consultants conspired to wrongly accuse her, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to cover failings at the hospital\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Letby, 33, denies murdering seven babies and attempting to murder 10 others on the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. None of the babies can be named for legal reasons. She is alleged to have intentionally added insulin to Child F\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intravenous feed bag on a night shift in August 2015, less than 24 hours after she allegedly murdered his twin brother, Child E. She is accused of trying to kill Child L in April 2016, around the same time she allegedly tried to murder his twin brother, Child M, by injecting air into his bloodstream. Nick Johnson KC, cross-examining Letby for a second day, asked her if she agreed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153someone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unlawfully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd given Child F and Child L insulin. She agreed, saying that the feeding bags must have been tampered with by either someone on the unit or before the bags arrived on the ward. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Insulin has been added by somebody \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how or who I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on, only that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that any member of staff on the unit would make a mistake and give insulin.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Letby was also asked why some of her colleagues on the neonatal unit suspected her of murder. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you suggesting there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some sort of agreement between medical staff to get you?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asked Johnson. Letby replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the consultants group, I do believe yes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked who, Letby named Dr Stephen Brearey, Dr John Gibbs, Dr Ravi Jayaram and one other doctor who cannot be named for legal reasons. Johnson replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Four doctors. A gang of four, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call them. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the conspiracy?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Letby replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have apportioned blame on to me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked for their motive, she replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe to cover failings at the hospital.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said staff failings had contributed to the death of one baby, Child A, because he had been left without fluids for four hours because of problems with his feeding lines. Jurors have been told that following her arrest a total of 257 shift handover sheets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some including the names of babies she allegedly harmed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were found at her then home in Chester and her parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 address in Hereford. Johnson said there were so many that if piled up they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost the size of a phone book\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She told the jury on Thursday that the sheets were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153insignificant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just bits of paper\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is the truth. They have no meaning to me at all. I have copious pieces of paper and cards that I have not thrown away my whole life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Letby admitted sometimes visiting the unit at night while not working a shift. She said this was to fill in paperwork or speak to colleagues and the night-time visits were owing to her shift patterns. The jury heard that she had gone to the unit on her day off when a baby girl, Child G \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whom she allegedly tried to murder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was seriously ill. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You had been having a look at her, hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you? Why are you looking at this child?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asked the prosecutor. Letby said she had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153checking on her\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, having come to the unit to complete paperwork relating to that baby. She also denied feeling \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a thrill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from photographing a sympathy card sent to the parents of Child I, a baby girl she allegedly murdered on the fourth attempt.

In an interview with US broadcaster NBC News, Tom Buda, president of Buda Security, conceded that the pursuit was not high speed, but did put the couple in danger. Harry and Meghan and the duchess\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother said on Wednesday they were involved in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153near-catastrophic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd two-hour car chase after being followed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The episode, which recalls the death of Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed when her car crashed while being followed by paparazzi in Paris in 1997, is said to have happened after the three attended an awards ceremony on Tuesday. The account has been disputed, however, with police confirming there had been no reported collisions, injuries or arrests, and one photographic agency denying that the paparazzi behaved aggressively, even suggesting that the Sussexes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 vehicle was driven erratically. A taxi driver briefly involved has also cast doubt on the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. However, on Thursday, Buda told NBC the group of photographers pursuing them were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153driving aggressively and badly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added that they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153following us to find out where we were staying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added that some cars were trying to leapfrog them and two cars ahead were working to slow traffic down. Although it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was not a high-speed pursuit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Buda said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was reckless by them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added that they went to the NYPD\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19th precinct station. The couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims were disputed by one of the picture agencies, Backgrid USA, which said in a statement that it had received photos and videos from four freelance photographers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They had no intention of causing any distress or harm, as their only tool was their cameras. A few of the photos even show Meghan Markle smiling inside a cab,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the statement said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The photographers report that one of the four SUVs from Prince Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security escort was driving in a manner that could be perceived as reckless.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A former bodyguard of Harry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has said the Sussexes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 security should have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153properly stage-managed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The protection team he has got at the moment has never dealt with such a high-profile celebrity as Harry and Meghan,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ken Wharfe told ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Good Morning Britain on Thursday, adding that he had some sympathy for the couple. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The whole point is you have to take advice on this, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know to what extent the New York police department were involved, but basically it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that needs to be properly stage-managed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/18/stark-before-and-after-images-reveal-the-obliteration-of-bakhmut", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "title": "Stark before-and-after images reveal the obliteration of Bakhmut", "lead": "High-resolution satellite imaging of city in eastern Ukraine lay bare its destruction after months of bombardment", "author": "Matt Fidler", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T16:31:42Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036488", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/29071d20ad867acea4ac515de878190634927f84/3_0_5900_3543/500.jpg", "body": "High-resolution satellite images published by Maxar provide stark insights into the destruction of the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, caused by months of bombardment and fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces.

There was no escaping it, not this time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This defeat was very, very deserved,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the midfielder admitted when at last it was over, which by then was all Real Madrid could aspire to. The night before the Champions League semi-final second leg, Carlo Ancelotti had gathered his players at the Etihad Stadium and told them there would be moments when they would have to hang on: 20 minutes, 25, maybe 30. It is their way, and Manchester City had made them suffer before, after all. Just not quite like this. Even half an hour turned out to be hopelessly optimistic. That mark had just been passed when Kroos crashed a shot against the bar. It was Real Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first, and the first time they had anything resembling possession. In the opening quarter of an hour they had averaged less than a pass a minute and it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t got much better. City had taken nine shots, and if they led only 1-0 it was because Thibaut Courtois had made two extraordinary saves. And yet in that moment, as the goal shook, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help wondering whether Madrid were going to go and do it again. Two minutes later, Bernardo Silva made it 2-0. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a no, then. Asked whether that shot might have changed things, Kroos conceded that it could have been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153different game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but preferred a broader analysis where the conclusions were clear. Half an hour? This was the whole night; City never loosened their grip, never allowed room for another miracle, and Madrid never found a way of wresting control, Juli\u00c3\u00a1n \u00c3\ufffdlvarez scoring the fourth in the 91st minute. The champions were out. No what ifs, just logic applied. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153City were superior,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Luka Modric said; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153better from start to finish,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dani Carvajal agreed. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football, it can happen, Ancelotti said, insisting there was no need to make a drama of defeat and responding sharply to suggestions that Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude had been off. But he is under no illusions as to where he is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c indeed, it has been part of his success \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is aware that defeat brings consequences, and knew he would be pressed about his future. He has been interrogated about it in each of the 100-plus press conferences this season; how could he not be now, after the game the entire season built towards, the match they kept saying would define his future? Ancelotti, constantly reminded of a supposed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unwritten rule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that says if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win the Champions League you get sacked, was asked whether he could understand the club having doubts about him continuing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one doubts: the president was clear a fortnight ago,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he replied. Back then, after Madrid had won the Copa del Rey and after months of speculation, Florentino P\u00c3\u00a9rez said he did not want to hear any more about Ancelotti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future: he had a contract until 2024 and that was that. And yet referring the question back to the president was deliberate, another hand played in a complex situation in which club and coach have worked themselves into an awkward stalemate that does not truly suit either party. Ancelotti would like to become Brazil manager, and suspects Madrid would like him to as well, conscious that belief in him is not unwavering. The sack, at one point anticipated, would not be entirely unwelcome to him; resignation would not be entirely unwelcome to them. But neither side want responsibility, so time and opportunities pass with both sides talking of continuity, if not with a huge amount of conviction. Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of institutional relations, Emilio Butrague\u00c3\u00b1o, on Wednesday night called Ancelotti a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stupendous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd coach, who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has a contract\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but stopped short of a guarantee that he does not have the authority to give, and the doubts are certainly there. Madrid have relinquished the league early, 14 points behind Barcelona, and this defeat was not so out of place with what happened last week or even last season, not such a dramatic collapse. That gets revisited now, a feeling that maybe this was due, bound to happen at some point. Last night Courtois talked about small things falling Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way last season and not this, while Pep Guardiola pointedly recalled how Kroos admitted that Madrid could have lost 10-1 in the first leg at the Etihad a year ago. As for the second leg, well, that remained hard to believe and still hurt: City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coach talked about the pain his team had carried, a desire for justice driving them. Nor had it been just the City games last year: in the Parc des Princes, PSG had racked up 22 shots to three, then another 21 at the Bernab\u00c3\u00a9u. Even at Stamford Bridge, Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best away performance, Chelsea had taken 20. Thomas Tuchel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team then had 29 at the Bernab\u00c3\u00a9u. City managed more than 30 across the two legs. And in the final, Liverpool took 23 to Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three, 9-1 on target. At times it defied analysis, the talk naturally of mystique and miracles, yet there was also a patience, a capacity for resistance.They may not be a systems team but Madrid do many things well, and one of them is to wait. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be times when you have to accept that your opponent is better,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kroos said, expressing a kind of humility to go alongside the supreme confidence that their moments would come and they had the quality and character to grab them. For as long as they found a way, fine. But this time they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. This time there was no way back, City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pressure suffocating them. This time some looked their age, or at least that became an inevitable theme in the wake of the 4-0, endlessly repeated last night: Luka Modric is 37, Karim Benzema 35, Kroos 33, Dani Carvajal 31. The talk now is of transition, a new generation and some of the talent is there: Eduardo Camavinga is 20, Vin\u00c3\u00adcius J\u00c3\u00banior and Rodrygo are 22, Aur\u00c3\u00a9lien Tchouam\u00c3\u00a9ni is 23, Federico Valverde 24, \u00c3\u2030der Milit\u00c3\u00a3o 25. They are confident of signing Jude Bellingham, who is 19. Kylian Mbapp\u00c3\u00a9, of course, did not come, when they thought he would. That evolution was already under way, which is not to say it is easy. Ancelotti says he has asked for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from his young players and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153understanding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from his older ones as opportunities are shared. Of 34 league games this campaign, Kroos has started 22, Modric 17 and Benzema 21, although the Frenchman has had injuries, far from last season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s form. Even in last season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Champions League, Camavinga was introduced in each of the second legs, decisive every time, and Valverde\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hybrid role brought energy to midfield. By the end of the City game, Casemiro, Kroos and Modric had been withdrawn. They were back for the final, which Madrid won. Back again this season, too, and deservedly. Now Madrid had reached a semi-final, an 11th in 13 years, in a season in which they scored six against Liverpool, four against Chelsea. Defeat tends to accelerate everything, especially one like this, so devastating, so definitive. Vin\u00c3\u00adcius insisted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen next year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And the temptation is to tear it all up. But that is their truth too. Just as it is true that the City team who were better than them at the Etihad Stadium are better than everyone else there too, scoring seven against Leipzig, six against Manchester United, four against Liverpool and Arsenal, three against Bayern. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to assimilate this loss first and then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get into more depth now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Modric said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When Real Madrid lose, everything is made very big: lots of analysis, lots of criticism. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to it, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sink us. This team still has much to give.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kroos said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that we had a bad Champions League campaign: we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve played many good games and we were just one game away from the final. As a coach or a player you sign for this club and you know they expect the maximum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fortunately, we have often done the maximum, but nor is it normal to win the Champions League all the time. Lots of teams would swap with us. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need defeat to appreciate what we did; I always knew that what we did was madness. The last time I heard it was the end of an era was 2019 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long time ago. So, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re OK.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/18/harry-meghan-get-to-a-place-of-safety-ex-royal-bodyguard-on-paparazzi-chases", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGet to a place of safety\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: ex-royal bodyguard on paparazzi chases", "lead": "Former royal protection officer advises how Harry and Meghan should respond when harassed by press photographers", "author": "Jamie Grierson", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T16:15:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036498", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ae656ae695967d22be5f03958b5f8dbdd1646ca1/0_265_3973_2384/500.jpg", "body": "When Simon Morgan was bodyguard to members of the British royal family, paparazzi pursuits were an almost daily occurrence. But Morgan, who served with the elite SO14 royalty personal protection unit within the Metropolitan police, said he would never advise a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cat and mouse chase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a fleet of photographers hellbent on snapping the picture that could make their fortune. He told the Guardian the frenzied climate that fuels the sort of paparazzi pursuits that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said they experienced in New York on Wednesday was worse than it was when Diana, Princess of Wales died nearly 30 years ago. Now a director of operations and training at Trojan Consultancy, a personal protection firm based in west London, Morgan, who served as a personal protection officer to the late Queen among other senior royals, said he would always attempt to engage with the paparazzi. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I was with royal protection it was almost a daily occurrence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your first port of call is always communication \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you see the paparazzi outside a restaurant or outside a nightclub or whatever, engagement is always the first positive step. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Explain to them that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re part of a police protection operation and happy for them to take pictures but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take them on your terms: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou snap there, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t chase the car and block cars in\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and so on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Morgan said requests for cooperation would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fall on deaf ears\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but a chase was not an option that should be considered as a police officer or a private operator. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because, as has been highlighted in this case [Harry and Meghan], it then becomes a public safety issue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In a heightened state of awareness driving cars at potentially speed through narrow, populated streets, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re now the cause potentially of what could be a fatal accident. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to get into that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Morgan said law enforcement was invariably called for backup, which was easier for members of the police service but still possible as a private operator if it had good relations with the authorities. If this is not available and a chase unfolds, then a place of safety must be sought, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The chase is taking place because of you, so you ask: can you get to your residence, can you get to your place of safety \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we always used to favour a police station \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can you get to the police station and seek refuge there and let the incident die down? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are different strategies you can use, but playing that cat-and-mouse game is one that is fraught with danger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd All royal protection officers are required to complete the national police protection drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 course, and at royalty protection level officers already have to be a class one police driver. Subsequently, they are put on the protection officers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 course, which covers areas such as anti-hijack driving. Having a qualified security driver is a vital part of any protection operation, Morgan said. As the duke and duchess have been at pains to emphasise, the attention from the paparazzi takes a significant toll on their wellbeing. This is not lost on royal protection officers, Morgan says, who see an element of pastoral care towards his clients, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153principals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as part of the job. In the case of the Duke of Sussex, he will be dealing with the incident at hand but also the stress of past trauma from the death of his mother, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The duke firmly blames the paparazzi for that relentless pursuit of his mother that ended in her death. For him, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just the incident [this week], it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the trauma of previous incidents that would have come back to him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Morgan said reassuring the principal was one of the many roles of the protection officer and part of that was making sure the team was fully qualified. Looking ahead, Morgan does not see the paparazzi picture changing soon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about supply and demand. There is a demand for these images. People want to know what celebrities are up to, what high-profile people like the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are up to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Police protection officers have an understanding of the legislation available to them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but so do the paparazzi, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have to be clear with your principal that we will not be playing a cat-and-mouse game with the press,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will not be driving through the streets of London, Paris, Rome, whatever the case may be. We will stop and get out, and we will go to a place of safety.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/18/hillsong-church-documentary-carl-lentz-scandal", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy do pastors keep falling?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: inside the shocking downfall of Hillsong church", "lead": "In a new docuseries, the glamorous, Instagram-friendly church is put under the spotlight with new scandalous revelations", "author": "David Smith in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T16:15:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036501", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d662d768f628e4b38a3ca8eb7c24c6a8811197e6/120_0_3600_2160/500.jpg", "body": "Before the Hot Priest in the BBC comedy series Fleabag, there was Carl Lentz. For a time the young, tattooed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hype-priest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was the face of the global megachurch Hillsong, preaching a cool brand of Christianity to sports stars and celebrities such as Justin Bieber. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carl was incredibly charismatic, an insanely good speaker, able to break down the Bible in relevant, almost street terms,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains the film-maker Stacey Lee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He was funny, he was vulnerable, he just gave so much of himself. He unto himself became his own celebrity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But to paraphrase John Milton, Lentz dropped from the zenith like a falling star when an extramarital affair came to light and he was fired from Hillsong. The fact that he has now broken his silence in a frank, expansive interview with Lee has made headlines this week. But Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four-part documentary series, The Secrets of Hillsong, based on original reporting by the Vanity Fair magazine journalists Alex French and Dan Adler, is about more than one turbulent priest. Lentz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scandal was just the first layer of an onion of allegations of child abuse, sexual assault, racial discrimination and labour exploitation that left Hillsong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation in tatters. At the centre is Brian Houston, a New Zealand-born pastor and evangelist who prayed for Donald Trump during a visit to the White House, the culmination of a journey that had begun in a small church in Sydney back in 1983. When Houston founded Hillsong with his wife, Bobbie, it shook up staid old ways of worship with vibrant services and creative sermons. In the 1990s Hillsong Music, the church\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s music ministry, began producing and releasing worship albums such as Shout to the Lord and The Power of Your Love that took off in churches worldwide, fuelling the growth of the brand. Hillsong expanded its reach by establishing campuses and affiliate churches overseas, starting in London in 1992. The turning point for its ambitions in America came in 2010. On 6 October that year, the photo and video sharing social networking service Instagram was born; on 17 October, HillsongNYC in New York was launched. They were a perfect match for each other and for millennials. Lee, who was born in New Zealand and is in her 30s, explains: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a church that was perfect Instagram fodder: a pastor [Lentz] in a leather jacket hangs out with Justin Bieber; churches in a nightclub. Every week there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a plethora of Instagram worthy moments that you can document. You can see how the church was able to cultivate a very public image and infiltrate the pop culture world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hillsong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style of mass gatherings, slick online reach and Grammy-winning Christian rock music spread to Los Angeles, Paris, Moscow, Cape Town, Buenos Aires and other cities. More than 100,000 people were attending weekly services at Hillsong in about 20 countries, including over 10,000 at several locations in the US. But for all the energy and enterprise, Hillsong ran into scrutiny and controversy over its theology, financial practices and leadership structure. Rapacious growth had become an end in itself. Speaking via Zoom from Joshua Tree, California, Lee says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was so much murkiness in the mission that the original goals of the church somehow got lost. The goal of this church from the very outset was reaching as many people as possible and, as our religious historian says in the documentary, in their desire to grow, they never stopped to think if they should. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The whole point of church is to protect the people within but what happened with Hillsong is that got turned around: let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just keep getting more and more and more rather than taking care of the people that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already got within your own walls. Ultimately that model, replicated across countries, across decades, turned out to be not the best model after all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lentz, of HillsongNYC, was a charismatic, larger than life figure. He spun yarns about how he baptised Bieber in the New York bathtub of the basketball veteran Tyson Chandler in the middle of the night (Bieber has since denounced the church). His marriage to Laura, a fellow pastor whom he met when they were students at Hillsong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s training college in Sydney, was part of the mythology. Lee reflects: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Laura is not just his wife. She was Hillsong royalty well before Carl came along. She was epicentre of this church and the origins of this church so ultimately there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a double betrayal that happens here: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just her husband in this insanely public way, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the church.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lentz had an extramarital affair with Ranin Karim, a designer in New York. In 2020 he acknowledged on Instagram that he had cheated on Laura, meaning that both were rapidly forced out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She lost everything at that exact same moment that her husband does. Again, this role of a church, a place of safety, of refuge, of support in your worst moments, and this church was not there in that moment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just go straight to the systemic issues. You have to build up their story as well in order to understand how deep those ties were to the origin and how cut-throat, perhaps, that action to excommunicate them was.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The affair and marital strife is recounted in painful detail in the second episode of Secrets of Hillsong through the first major interviews with Lentz and Laura since they left the megachurch. Lentz prays aloud on camera, describes how Hillsong\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fast growth led him to take excessive amounts of medication and admits that he was unfit to lead by the end. He also reveals that he had another affair with the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nanny, who was also a member of the church. He says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I did those things. Those are on me. I take responsibility for those, and for the rest of my life I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be making amends where I can.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite everything, the Lentzes are still together and living in Sarasota, Florida, where he now works in advertising. Their candour was the result of months of patient trust-building by Lee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can feel that and the gravity of Carl sitting down at the end of episode one. Like, where to begin? I try to see the human side of every subject. I wanted to be able to evolve the conversation: why do pastors keep falling? This is not the first time and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly not going to be the last. But why does this keep happening? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is it about his life and the position he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s put in that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enable him to reach out to someone and say, hey, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not qualified for this anymore, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m stepping back? There were no people around. There were no structures or systems of accountability that were happening for him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There were no support around them for the marriage and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an excuse but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the structure of the church. So what happens when things start to go wrong? Who do they turn to? Who pastors the pastor?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see a lot of those conversations. This was about being able to understand the systematic mechanisms at place within Hillsong and what was happening with the leadership when other issues were coming up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we know, as the documentary talks about, is this system of controlling the narrative, covering up where you need to cover up, slicing someone off over here, being able to ultimately protect the church instead of protecting the congregants of the church.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Secrets of Hillsong gives a voice to survivors and victims. For all its modernity, the church was corrosively traditional in its attitudes toward women, people of colour and the LGBTQ+ community. Senior positions were dominated by white men. Five female congregants in New York wrote a letter in 2017 alleging inappropriate sexual behaviour between staff and interns; all five have since departed. In 2015 a royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse found that Houston had failed to alert police about allegations his father, Frank, had sexually assaulted children. Houston has pleaded not guilty to a charge of concealing the crime until his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death in 2004. The case remains before the courts, with hearings to resume next month. The documentary also explores allegations that Houston himself made sexually suggestive remarks to a woman at a conference in 2019. He claims the incident was the result of accidental mix of alcohol and anxiety medication. Before he stepped down as Hillsong leader last year, Houston had enjoyed political cover for much of his career. He took great pride in visiting Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a US president eager to garner support from Christian evangelicals despite his own unbiblical behaviour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in 2019 when he could be seen telling supporters that he was in the cabinet room and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just had the chance to pray for president Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Lee comments: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hillsong comes from Australia so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very intertwined there, but what we started to witness at the end of Brian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reign was that, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to make it big on a global scale, you also have to make it big within political America and he was certainly making inroads at that point in time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we are witnessing within modern religion is not just this institution that exists within its own silo but has fingers in many pies. The moral majority and all the rest of it: that history of religion and politics being intertwined goes back a long way, even though there are laws supposedly to protect against that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What was so shocking about the roots of Hillsong is not just within the political system but within the judicial system. Why are the accounts of child sexual abuse victims not being heard? These are violent criminal acts against children. Where is everybody? That is the part we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to untangle. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just the power structures within celebrity but where does it get more dangerous? Where does it get more problematic?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Secrets of Hillsong is available on Hulu on 19 May with a UK and Australia date to be announced"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/18/events-marking-queen-elizabeths-death-cost-the-public-161m-figures-show", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Events marking Queen Elizabeth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death cost the public \u00c2\u00a3161.7m, figures show", "lead": "Critics say the extravagance is inappropriate when people are struggling with the cost of living crisis", "author": "Kevin Rawlinson", "datePublished": "2023-05-18T16:10:43Z", "dateScraped": "2023-05-19 14:09:14.036504", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c2c4621c5e86bede741e58abd5b70a4fd9fdbe53/0_345_5208_3125/500.jpg", "body": "The events to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II last year cost the public \u00c2\u00a3161.7m, according to a Treasury estimate. A 10-day period of national mourning, culminating in the monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funeral, was announced after her death on 8 September last year. About 250,000 people attended the lying in state, while official audience data showed that more than 29 million people in the UK watched the funeral on television. Critics said the extravagance of the event was inappropriate at a time when many people were struggling with basic needs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is an assumption that these things have to be done on this scale and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an assumption that needs to be questioned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in the middle of a cost of living crisis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the chief executive of Republic, Graham Smith. Government ministers have argued that the commemorations needed to reflect the national importance of the event. But Smith said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When people can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put food on the table \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though they are in work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they would probably derive more from a hot meal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than from the pageantry surrounding the queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funeral. Events were held across the UK, and the chief secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, laid out the estimated cost of \u00c2\u00a3161.7m in a written statement to parliament. The biggest spenders were the Home Office, which paid out \u00c2\u00a373.7m, followed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which paid \u00c2\u00a357.4m, and the Scottish government, with costs of \u00c2\u00a318.8m. Glen broke down the cost to each department. Department for Culture, Media and Sport: \u00c2\u00a357.4m Department for Transport: \u00c2\u00a32.6m Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office: \u00c2\u00a32.1m Home Office: \u00c2\u00a373.7m Ministry of Defence: \u00c2\u00a32.9m Northern Ireland Office: \u00c2\u00a32.1m Scottish government: \u00c2\u00a318.8m Welsh government: \u00c2\u00a32.2m Glen said the costs included only money spent specifically on events, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as opposed to costs that would have been incurred in any case\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said the Treasury had paid to meet some those costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fully refunding the Scottish government, Welsh government and Northern Ireland Office for their respective costs, which in turn they were able to repay to partners who also incurred costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Downing Street said the money was used to facilitate the smooth running of the event and ensure mourners from the UK and across the world could visit and take part safely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, a major international event of this scale, we wanted to ensure that we could enable people to pay their respects,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a No 10 spokesperson said. Glen added that the events were of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge national significance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153During this period, many hundreds of thousands of people came in person to pay their respects, at the lying at rest in Edinburgh, the lying in state in Westminster, as well as in London and Windsor for the state funeral on 19 September. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many more people also came out to support His Majesty the king and other members of the royal family as they travelled around the UK during this time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priorities were that these events ran smoothly and with the appropriate level of dignity, while at all times ensuring the safety and security of the public. According to estimates from the website FactCheck, the most expensive state events in recent decades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c adjusted for inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were the funerals of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the queen mother, and the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which cost between \u00c2\u00a37m and \u00c2\u00a38.4m each. The site said Margaret Thatcher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funeral cost about \u00c2\u00a33.8m by today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prices, while the funeral of Winston Churchill was nearer to \u00c2\u00a31m. Speaking at the time, officials said the logistics of the commemorations were equivalent to organising hundreds of state visits all at once. The Foreign Office assigned hundreds of staff to work on the task, and the mixture of security, diplomacy, protocol and logistics was regarded as probably the most extensive piece of short-term planning to face the diplomatic service since Churchill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funeral."}]
