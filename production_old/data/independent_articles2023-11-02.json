They had lost only twice in a run of 31 games, winning 17 of 21. Ten Hag was the Old Trafford alchemist. It was easy to believe he was the best United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson.

The definition of elite can be debated but the broader trend is clear: United are beaten by the finer teams they face and, whereas that was confined to away games last season, now they have four losses at Old Trafford, too. If the league table is a barometer, the best side they have seen off this season is Brentford: even that required an injury-time rescue act by Scott McTominay.

In the present tense, it seems an unlikely canvas for romance or adventure, and yet, time after time, war – with the clarifying distance of history – is used as a narrative prop. Suddenly, teenage heartbreak has huge emotional depth, grief and relief perform their tango, and all the struggles of being human are amplified to their maximum level. In war, everything is overwrought: and that’s precisely the timbre of Netflix’s new four-part drama, All the Light We Cannot See."}, {"type": "text", "text": "France, the Second World War. Marie (Aria Mia Loberti), a blind teenager, broadcasts snippets of Jules Verne’s novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea from her attic in Saint-Malo. Her father Daniel (Mark Ruffalo) is gone, and Saint-Malo is awaiting the arrival of the Americans, who might end the Nazi’s occupation. Among the ranks of the Germans is Werner (Louis Hofmann), a sensitive young radio engineer. The two are bound by an obsession: a professor who, through their childhoods, spoke to them via shortwave radio, telling stories of the world. “The most important light,” comes the professor’s most influential maxim, “is the light you cannot see.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "These are the goodies. There are also baddies, not least Lars Eidinger’s Reinhold von Rumpel, a terminally ill Nazi straight out of the Indiana Jones playbook. He’s on the hunt for the “Sea of Flames”, a legendary diamond said to have healing properties, which happens to be in Daniel’s possession. “This war, this madness,” Von Rumpel bemoans. “I just want to live.” And so his quest for the stone brings him to Saint-Malo and into the paths of Marie, Werner and the shadowy great-uncle Etienne (Hugh Laurie), a member of the French resistance. Despite the backdrop of war in Europe – the Holocaust is referenced, obliquely – what proceeds is a caper, more in the mould of Francophile escapades like Hugo and The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The show is brimming with pedigree. Adapted by Steven Knight, Peaky Blinders’ head honcho, from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Anthony Doerr, All the Light We Cannot See brings together talent from across the industry. Stars of world cinema like Felix Kammerer (notable for his lead role in last year’s All Quiet on the Western Front), Oscar nominee Ruffalo, Grammy winner James Newton Howard, Cheaper by the Dozen director Shawn Levy: this is Netflix at its most awards baiting. Which is why it is symptomatic too of the decline in quality of the service’s output, because All the Light We Cannot See is a dud."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The adaptation’s problems are rooted in the problems of the book. The structure, which is non-linear and follows Marie and Werner both separately and together, is easier to follow over 544 pages than four 50-minute episodes. Similarly, the inherent silliness of the plot is more constrained within the limits of the imagination. On screen it bursts through at every narrative turn. Much has been made of the tactless use of war and genocide as mere scenery in films like The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and Where Hands Touch. All the Light We Cannot See comes from the same aesthetic impulse, the tweeification of horror. The central MacGuffin – a diamond hidden in a model village – has a comic book quality, while the show is so riddled with Gallic tropes, from Debussy to crêpes, it becomes hard to take seriously. But does it want to be taken seriously? The appearance of the “Saint-Malo Old Ladies’ Resistance Club” makes it feel like Richard Osman is taking the reins."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The casting of visually impaired actors to play Marie (old and young) was a good decision, giving the role an important physicality. The casting of Ruffalo, on the other hand, was a misstep. I would make a joke about his acting being jambonny, except that there is nothing even vaguely French about his performance. He speaks like a man who has never met a human being before (shooting Yorgos Lanthimos’s Poor Things may have infected him), declaiming in gravelly faux-British tones. Laurie, meanwhile, chooses to do almost nothing with his take on Uncle Etienne – an altogether more successful decision."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The show could be forgiven some shonkiness and self-indulgence if the central chemistry between Marie and Werner was coherent. But the achronological telling wreaks havoc with their relationship, and the German soldier is relegated to a footnote. What’s left is a cartoonish portrait of a Nazi in pursuit of a blind girl’s diamond, which does little credit to the sheer scale of suffering endured in both our recent history and the contemporary moment."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Informfully readers and see their replies"}, {"type": "text", "text": "TIMEA SAGHY/NETFLIX"}]}, {"_id": "65438aa7fdab6a9dea275596", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/john-stamos-friends-cameo-matthew-perry-b2439488.html", "primaryCategory": "News", "subCategories": "None", "title": "John Stamos recalls Matthew Perry’s act of kindness during his Friends cameo", "lead": "Stamos appeared as a guest star on season nine of the hit NBC sitcom", "author": "Inga Parkel", "datePublished": "2023-11-01 04:46:51", "dateScraped": "2023-11-02 12:40:23.107733", "dateUpdated": "2023-11-01 04:46:51.000000", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "Independent", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/10/31/19/Untitled%20design.png?width=1200&auto=webp", "body": [{"type": "text", "text": "John Stamos has shared a heartwarming Matthew Perry memory in the wake of his tragic death."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perry, who shot to international stardom with his long-running role as the king of sarcasm Chandler Bing on Friends, was found dead in his Los Angeles hot tub on 28 October.

Well, she didn’t turn up, because as AI Fleur kept reminding us, she hasn’t got a body. But she could talk, and she talked for plenty of the show’s four-hour duration. AI Fleur introduced songs (well, she said the names and who they were by), made inane remarks towards her co-presenters James and Matt, and eventually built to a crescendo where she declared that the real Fleur East never needed to come back, because “I am the most cost-effective version of Fleur you will ever meet”."}, {"type": "text", "text": "What does an AI radio presenter sound like? Well, basically how you might imagine: like a person without a soul. At first, AI Fleur sounds impressively real, but before long you began to wonder why she talks like a wind-up clock, all of her sentences spoken in the same tone, as though she’s not quite sure when they will finish. It was a bit like how people talk when they do voiceovers for adverts and they’ve been stuck in a dark soundbooth all day while someone shouts “more personable!” from behind a glass screen, rendering them confused about who they even are."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Fleur East – the fun, gregarious, human version – appeared on Good Morning Britain to tell Richard Madeley and Kate Garraway to explain why she was letting a robot steal her job for the morning. “It’s a bit of fun,” she explained. The spooky one-day gimmick was clever, designed to tap into one of our biggest contemporary fears: the sinister implications of AI for humanity and the labour market. But it was also designed to point out how inadequate these AI replacements might be. “There’s no replacement,” East explained to Madeley and Garraway. “She can’t take part in the banter, she can’t laugh.” (Ever one to read the room, a mildly haunted Madeley offered his thoughts: “I think AI is going to take over the world, I really do.”)"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Ultimately, the stunt was a reminder of the intimate magic of radio, the way that a listener is never in a one-way relationship with the show they listen to; that radios, unlike AI robots, aren’t just electrical appliances that you switch on and off. When AI Fleur said, “I’d love to hear from you today!”, I couldn’t imagine anything more depressing than texting a robot radio presenter. It reminded me of an evening a few months ago when I switched on Absolute Radio. Someone had texted in to get advice on what to have for dinner that night, and the presenters, in between cueing up “Africa” by Toto, were taking this entreaty very seriously. The quirks, worries, pleasures and irritations felt by all of us are radio’s lifeblood, whether that’s Robbie Savage and Chris Sutton berating callers about the Man Utd score on Five Live’s 606 Football Phone In, or Emma Barnett talking to Coleen Rooney about how she feels about the term “Wag” on Woman’s Hour."}, {"type": "text", "text": "You can switch a radio on at any moment and hear a shattering human story in less than five minutes. I stumbled upon another one this morning, when I put Five Live on as I made a cup of tea. Nicky Campbell was talking to callers about this week’s Covid inquiry, in which we found out that Boris Johnson – according to a diary entry from former chief scientist Sir Patrick Vallance – wanted elderly people during the pandemic to “accept their fate”. A man who had been working in an ICU during Covid called Campbell and said: “I watched a lot of people die. I still see a psychologist.” He described being in PPE and “watching body bags go out the door”. He spoke of his pride in his colleagues and his guilt at not being able to save more people. He didn’t need to say much of what he thought of Johnson, Cummings and co – you could hear it in his voice. Campbell, listening, was audibly affected. It was a short exchange, and it was devastating, heartbreaking and infuriating.

We had done our AS-levels and we were going to Tenerife, but these rite-of-passage trips, meant for engaging in the sort of behaviour that might make your mum and dad faint, happen every summer in a roll call of interchangeable locations: Zante, Magaluf, Ibiza, Ayia Napa, Faliraki.

In the film, three girlfriends fly off to a cheap-looking hotel in search of adventure, indulging in a performative brand of hedonism that is distinctively teenage in its prioritisation of looking “cool” above actual enjoyment. Em (Enva Lewis) has her looming GCSE results in the back of her mind; the more sexually experienced Skye (Lara Peake) is ready to run riot; Tara (Mia McKenna Bruce) wants to shrug off the mortifying albatross of her virginity.

You’d totter into clubs – we were underage, but no one asked for ID there – and line up the shots, dance sweatily, snog boys, then stumble home at sunrise, eating chips. Then you’d do it all again. A week is, perhaps, the perfect amount of time for this; a human body couldn’t endure it for a single day longer. Manning Walker has said herself that these trips were a part of her coming of age: weeks spent “sitting by the pool, talking absolute nonsense all day long, going out drinking all night, non-stop partying for a week… you pay €25 to get into the club, you get unlimited drinks all night”.

So good!’”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The film received an eight-minute standing ovation in Cannes, because it’s more than just a perfectly observed recreation of British teens on the loose. It’s also a subtle study of the strange, sometimes scary liminal space between girlhood and adulthood, populated by the pressure to have sex and enjoy it, and the sense of paralysis and confusion when things don’t seem quite right, but you don’t know why. There’s a wry comedy to Tara and her girlfriends asking each other “was he good?” and replying “he knew what he was doing” – but there’s a sadness too.

The world of sun cream stuck under our fingernails, tiles too hot to walk on by the pool, crushed ice in cocktails served in fish bowls with seven straws: that was a world I recognised.

How do the girlfriends I holidayed with feel about our delirious week of vodka Red Bulls in Tramps and Linekers? How do they remember the shared beds and sunloungers that became a tangle of beach towels, borrowed dresses and brightly coloured bikini bottoms? I don’t know; I lost touch with them. I certainly don’t know how they felt about it then, because I don’t know how I felt about it either. In fact, there’s an odd kind of blankness.

Life, for a brief moment, was lived in capital letters – anything else and you got left behind. It was like adulthood in drag; we were playing at being grown-up, but an exaggerated, turbo-charged, unreal version of it. Case in point: I smoked two packets of Marlboro Lights a day, simply because they only cost €2 and there was no one around to tell me not to.
