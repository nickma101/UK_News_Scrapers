He cites the example of the Eredivisie: the clubs produce roughly 97,000 tonnes of CO2 per year, around 0.05 per cent of the nation’s emissions. But the fans who follow the Eredivisie clubs are, in their daily lives, responsible for around 50 per cent. Rather than overly focusing on how a club can reduce its own impact, then, they should be trying to engage their community – local area, supporters – to understand the landscape and equip people to take change."}, {"type": "quote", "text": "“There is a need to move urgently on the climate crisis and few cultural entities have the reach of football, into every community of every corner of the planet” McCabe says. “I’ve been working for a long time before this and been a football fan for a long time too. I think people see that there is a real opportunity that we can come up with solutions that are meaningful, that work for the community, and that we’ll be able to spread faster than most organisations.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "But it isn’t easy. You do struggle to convince people."}, {"type": "quote", "text": "“Clubs can get shy about going into communities, because they are afraid of being called hypocrites,” McCabe says. “It’s the greatest paradox we could find ourselves in: everyone wants a case study for a transition that has never been done before. I think that’s partly because the environmental movement has had a bad habit of preaching and talking down. Most of the advice is punitive: shorter showers, turning off heating.”"}, {"type": "quote", "text": "“We can come up with strategies that bend the emissions curve, but if those strategies heap misery on those who are struggling they will only last a short period of time. Those people will despair at the change and they will vote in someone who vows to do away with it all. Over the last ten years we have seen all the evidence we need that people will vote for those who trick them into believing that they are on their side. So long term action has to tend to a community’s needs: clean cities, warmer homes, cheaper electricity, safer streets.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The answer, becoming a theme by now, is about engagement. If people in your community believe that you want the best for them, they will follow you down the road.

As ever, the locals all mucked in to get it ready."}, {"type": "quote", "text": "“A survey that we put out with the European Football For Development Network highlighted that football fans trust clubs more than they trust politicians,” McCabe says. “That’s important here and how we use that trust. If we preach, if we talk down, if we create false solutions, if we tell them to do small things that make their life harder while large entities are polluting en masse, people see through that nonsense. So we have to be smarter and treat that trust as sacred and use it to better the lives of people who we are engaged with.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The great tenet of being a humanitarian football club is universal inclusion. The moment you exclude – implicitly or otherwise – any element of your community then your entire model begins to crumble. There cannot be a choice.

It is led by community director Tommy Hynes, another within that emotionally invested Rolodex. Hynes had worked with the homeless in America and heroin addicts in Dublin before he took on this volunteer role."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The initiative involved running a mini-league within Mountjoy, often mixing up the teams between prisoners on different landings to promote greater integration. Talks were given about the importance of integration through sport and education. Over time, Hynes and other volunteers worked out that the rate of reoffending amongst those who played sport within their initiative was far lower than the average. Some of them began playing for local clubs and stuck with the game."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Other ideas became action: a 5k Park Run in the prison to bring competition and motivation to exercise; comedy and entertainment shows; a sign language course that Hynes says has been very successful; another Christmas routine, in which prisoners cook dinner for the elderly amongst the community at the football club. The most important are the talks in schools about education, sport and community. Prevention is far preferable to cure."}, {"type": "quote", "text": "“We wanted to know why people were staying away from crime,” says volunteer Jeff Conway, Hynes’ nephew who has a masters in criminology. “The answer was obvious: meaningful relationships, at home and in community. Participating in community events, building that trust between both parties. These people were disconnected, born into disconnection and grew up there. We just showed them different sides of life. It might sound obvious, but all they knew is to do what they had to to survive.”"}, {"type": "quote", "text": "“At one of those Christmas dinners,” says Hynes, “we sit everybody next to each other to talk. One of the prisoners came to be and said that he really hoped that he hadn’t stolen from the person he sat next to. One of the older people said that if she had had that boy’s life, she would probably have ended up doing the same thing. That’s what matters here: understanding and empathy.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The ideal is that those relationships remain meaningful long after they have existed in person because they act as emotional pathways to the future.

Some might not get out of that cycle, but some will.”"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Another fascinating aspect of Bohs – and one we’ve deliberately left until last – is how the football team interacts with these initiatives. One accusation against the club (although it’s hardly damning) could be that they are less of a football team and more of an activist organisation that happens to have 11 players on the side."}, {"type": "text", "text": "That criticism would ignore all the participation in the game of the youth and children’s teams and beyond, but you take the point: if Bohemians can be successful on the pitch, it makes that cynicism invalid. It also creates a symbiosis between the two pillars of this club that will make it more powerful. When the team is doing well, the community will feel more engaged with it and so buy-in is easier. When buy-in is easier, the club has more power to engage and inspire. When the club engages, it is more likely to attract more members and so grow."}, {"type": "text", "text": "That goes the other way too. The League of Ireland has rich owners and is awash with private investment. That undoubtedly makes life harder for Bohs.

They buy presents for kids and offer free tickets, but also aid a nationwide campaign to end direct provision. They have games of football with prisoners but also have a strategy to prevent crime at source. They engage with the local community on climate change but also work with vast organisations to lead the same message across the game."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It would be very easy, and forgivable, to focus on Dublin 7.

But the fans who follow the Eredivisie clubs are, in their daily lives, responsible for around 50 per cent.
