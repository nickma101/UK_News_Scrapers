I have seen the train tracks to Auschwitz- Birkenau and so have they; they know what is there. Don’t weaponise the Holocaust, people say. Quite so. But don’t forget it either. Most of them want two states in Israel and Palestine, and an end to the occupation in the West Bank, as I do.

How dare people in a western liberal democracy wish murderous theocracy on Israelis — and Palestinians, who they claim to support?
