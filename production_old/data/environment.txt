The climate crisis is the biggest single threat we face as a global community. In turn, meeting the goals of the Paris agreement and realising the opportunities of climate action is the task of the 21st century. No single government can address this alone. Together, we can rise to the challenge. When leaders gathered in Bretton Woods in 1944 as the second world war was winding to its close, they set themselves a formidable task. Their job was to design an international financial system that would reduce global recessions and instability, and lead to a steadier international political environment than the one which bedevilled the first half of the 20th century. The result was imperfect, but nonetheless astounding. The creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund was played an important role in supporting a more stable period through the second half of the 20th century. If a new Bretton Woods system was being thrashed out today, there would no doubt be agreement that the present task is even greater than that of the 20th century – building a global financial architecture that helps the world stay as close as possible to 1.5C of warming. We, the climate change ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, hold hope that it is still possible to urgently correct course and see deep, rapid emissions reductions across all sectors and systems. But it is critical we create the right conditions for all nations to thrive, and not be left behind. We need a global financial architecture that helps address the existential threat of climate change, while supporting countries’ development ambitions, responding to the millions slipping back into poverty and maintaining stability in the global financial system. Pacific and Caribbean Island nations are showing us the way. Their leadership has been instrumental in driving global climate ambition, including to advocate for adequate and predictable flows of climate finance. The prime minister of the Cook Islands and chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, Mark Brown, recently called for “transformation in our multilateral development funds and institutions”. This reflects the shift that we agree is necessary. We are also inspired by the leadership of Barbados, whose prime minister, Mia Mottley, is a tireless advocate for international financial architecture reform to support the most climate-vulnerable nations. This includes small island states who face multiple, cascading challenges to their economic prospects because of climate change. Growing debt burdens are limiting the ability of developing countries to absorb the costs of addressing the devastating impacts of climate change on their own. That’s why we recognise the need to increase support for adaptation and the response to climate impacts in the developing world. We also call for developing countries to be directly engaged in these reform efforts. Our climate and development goals must be pursued in lockstep. Given their important role, multilateral development banks are uniquely placed to demonstrate leadership and our three nations welcome the delivery of initial reforms including the recent announcement to unlock US$50bn in lending capacity over the next 10 years at the World Bank. However, there is much more to do. Considering how urgent it is to provide climate finance at affordable rates, we need to make it a collective effort to ensure climate change becomes a bigger factor in the balance sheet of each multilateral development bank, recognising the importance that the banks retain their preferred creditor status and AAA credit rating. The reality is that climate finance from these multilateral institutions continues to be patchy and at times inaccessible to the nations that need it most – particularly those in the Pacific, and small island states around the world. We must change that. Climate finance that is inaccessible has little value. Multilateral development bank portfolios should increase alignment with the Paris agreement and scale up the provision of concessional finance. That means integrating climate risk considerations and impacts across their activities. It means strengthening efforts to leverage and unlock greater private sector investment off the back of interventions as well as streamlining access, eligibility and delivery of projects and programs. Now is a time of both challenge and opportunity. The summit for a new global financing pact is under way right now and it presents a time to focus on pathways to advance climate and nature-positive reforms across global financial architecture. So too, the World Bank and IMF annual meetings in Marrakech in October represent an opportunity to formalise the evolution of the World Bank, which we hope will deliver meaningful action. We also extend our support to the United Arab Emirates as the Cop28 president, expressing our joint ambition to work closely with UAE to make multilateral development bank reform a key focus of their presidency agenda. We all need to be “all in”. And that includes all international financial institutions. Chris Bowen is Australia’s climate change and energy minister. Steven Guilbeault is the Canadian minister of environment and climate change. James Shaw is New Zealand’s climate change minister.'}, {'_id': '649409de51ac334b7fd25f88', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/22/country-diary-a-scarlet-shimmer-of-poppies-irresistible-to-bees', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: A scarlet shimmer of poppies, irresistible to bees | Paul Evans', 'lead': '<strong>The Marches, Shropshire:</strong> On a bright day after a thundery night, the bees are sometimes three or four to every flower', 'author': 'Paul Evans', 'datePublished': '2023-06-22 04:30:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:44:14.222644', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/ad1555a3a4e6e654fb1b228f55b17e5916f6b9b1/0_164_4000_2400/500.jpg', 'body': 'Scarlet flags unfurl and bees dance in revolutionary fervour. The flags are petals of an oriental poppy, Papaver orientale, in the Goliath group of species that may be called “Brilliant” or “Prince of Orange”. Depending on the intensity of light, it can flash through fiery red and sunset orange at the same time. The oriental species comes from the Caucasus, Iran and Turkey, and has appeared in gardens for centuries. These flowers are an explosion – dangerous, erotic, visionary. Oriental Poppies, painted by Georgia O’Keeffe in 1928, was groundbreaking, not just for its intense colour but for the textures of the flowers and their sense of movement. Maybe it also speaks of opium and sex magic, but it is a mesmerising image. It certainly has that effect on bees too. On this bright day in “flaming June”, after last night’s thunderstorm, the poppy flowers are full of garden bumblebees, Bombus hortorum, sometimes three or four in the same flower. Furry black-and-gold striped with white bums, the bees collide into the scarlet shimmer. Pulled by the visual lure of black patches inside the flower that give the illusion of dark, cavernous spaces, they crash into the rings of paddle-like stamens that carry a sable-purple pollen. These stamens skirt the curious seedhead structure with stigma of spidery, sticky-felt black arms, the diadem of the Mycenaean poppy goddess. The bumblebees have individual, high-pitched whines, like a kind of alarm or a magical note. Their wings vibrate the stamens at a certain frequency until the pollen baskets attached to their legs are full. The bees pull out of the flower to return to the nest. The pollen is potent enough and the bees do not receive nectar from the poppy. Like many bees, garden bumblebees have a cuckoo bee – an impostor species that steals the bee’s identity so that it can gain access to its nest to predate or exploit its colony. Bombus barbutellus looks very similar to Bombus hotorum, but has no pollen baskets on its legs; it steals from the labours of garden bumblebees. In the afternoon sun, the bees leave the poppies to their flames of riot and resurrection. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '649409de51ac334b7fd25f8a', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/22/thames-water-pipe-leaks-at-highest-level-in-five-years-foi-reveals', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Thames Water pipe leaks at highest level in five years, FOI reveals', 'lead': 'Water company to have regular meetings with environment secretary after failing to meet promised targets to fix leakage rates', 'author': 'Sandra Laville and Damian Carrington', 'datePublished': '2023-06-22 04:00:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:44:14.222682', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/85747d40c0697998a5065e077ec6407e36d53cde/0_257_4800_2881/500.jpg', 'body': 'The leakage rate from Thames Water pipes is the highest for five years and the company will not meet its target to plug them this year, according to information released under freedom of information laws. The company, which serves 15 million customers across London and Thames Valley, has to have regular meetings with the environment secretary because it is considered to be lagging in its performance. Details of letters released under freedom of information laws between the CEO, Sarah Bentley, and Rebecca Pow, the environment secretary, reveal that Thames is not fixing its leaks as it has promised. Bentley told Pow: “Right now, we have the highest leakage rate since 2018. Consequently, we have already signalled to Ofwat that we are behind on our 2022/23 leakage performance and our target this year will now be very challenging to achieve. “As annual leakage targets are based on a three-year rolling average, the impact of this year will be felt, not just this year but for the next two years’ performance.” Thames is proposing controversial measures to tackle drought in the future, including a “recycling” scheme in which up to 100m litres of treated sewage from the Mogden sewage works will be pumped into the River Thames at Teddington, south-west London. This will replace 100m litres abstracted from the Thames to tackle water shortages. The project raises environmental concerns including increased water temperatures and a change in the salinity of the river, which will affect fish and biodiversity. It also involves digging three to four 10.5-metre shafts within a protected nature reserve, Ham Lands, a site of importance for nature conservation (SINC), according to Thames documents. The company is also proposing to transport 155m litres of water a day from Wales, in another sensitive policy to try to tackle water shortages in London and the south-east. But its failure to fix its own leaks – which are estimated to be 630m litres a day – is likely to make it more difficult for Thames to get approval for these proposals in its draft water resources management plan. Bentley blamed the hot, dry weather last summer, followed by a wet winter, for exacerbating leaks from the network and from customers’ homes. “The hot and dry summer created an unprecedented ‘soil moisture deficit’, with ground drying out and causing leaks in our pipes and customers’ pipes,” she said. “It also led to large increases in demand from our customers [in some areas and at sometimes up to 50% more during the summer]. This drove up ‘unmeasured consumption’ and the need for us to pump more water through our pipes at higher pressure to satisfy demand that in turn also led to more leaks from our pipes. “The re-wetting of the ground later in the autumn then caused further movement and more leaks in our pipes and customers’ pipes. More recently, the freezing temperatures before Christmas, followed by a speedy thaw, has resulted in a new surge of leaks – both on our water supply network and on our customer’s pipes.” Thames, like other water companies, has a target to cut its leaks by 50% by 2050. But the Environment Agency has called for the company to increase this target. The EA says the company needs to do more to tackle leaks before suggesting schemes including the Teddington water recycling plan and the transport of water from Wales. It has said the security of water supply to the south-east and London will be at risk if the company does not tackle its leaks and reduce customer demand for water. Bentley told Pow in her letter dated January this year that Thames was running a £1m communications campaign to highlight the challenges “we all face” and educate customers on what they can do to help make sure there is enough water for everyone. The government has set a target of reducing individual daily water use from about 144 litres a day to 110 litres a day by 2050. On its website, Thames Water admits it is not acceptable that so much water is being lost. It said it is doing all that is reasonably practical to reduce leakage but it will miss its 22/23 target, and that will affect future years. However, the company is working to improve its “leakage transformation plan”. A Defra spokesperson said: “We have been very clear to water companies that we expect them to deliver on their commitments – including targets to reduce leakage by 30% by 2032. “The government is taking a number of actions to improve water supply through our Plan for Water, as well as taking action to clean up our water through more investment, stronger regulation and tougher enforcement.”'}, {'_id': '649409de51ac334b7fd25f94', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/22/woodside-has-huge-plans-to-drill-for-oil-and-gas-and-to-meet-its-climate-targets-how-does-it-do-it', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Woodside has huge plans to drill for oil and gas – and to meet its climate targets.

How? Woodside has said it “aims to thrive through the energy transition by building a low-cost, lower-carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio”. It has a 60% stake in the development, known as Trion, alongside Mexico’s state-owned oil exploration and production company, Pemex. Pemex discovered the oil and gas 2.5km deep, about 180km off shore in the Gulf of Mexico. There will be 24 wells and Pemex and Woodside are planning for the first oil to be pumped in 2028. Announcing the investment, Woodside pointed to analysis carried out for the UN’s climate science panel that it said showed there were “a range of future energy transition pathways” that allowed for new supply of fossil fuels while keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5C. Drilling for all this oil and gas in a new development would not even compromise the company’s climate targets, it said. But analysts told Temperature Check the Trion project would lead to the release of about 365m tonnes of CO2-equivalent over its lifetime – equal to about 80% of Australia’s annual emissions. How can Trion fit into Woodside’s climate targets? Most of the greenhouse gases from Trion will come when the oil and gas is burned and Woodside has no targets covering those emissions. Instead, the company says it will invest up to US$5bn in “new energy products and low-carbon services” by 2030. But that pledge is dwarfed by the money it is spending on fossil fuel production. Before announcing the US$4.8bn spend on Trion, the company said it planned to spend another US$6bn or so on an oilfield in Senegal and its Scarborough LNG project in Western Australia. Woodside does have targets for the emissions from its own operations (before the fossil fuels are sold and burned) but the company allows itself to buy offsets to meet them, which it did last year to turn a 3.5% rise in emissions into an 11% fall. Woodside thinks Trion will be financially “resilient” in a decarbonising world because it would make a quick return on investment and two-thirds of the fossil fuels would be extracted “within 10 years of start up”. The company said in its announcement it would use the cash from Trion to help fund “future developments in oil, gas and new energy” – a further pointer to the company’s hopes to keep exploiting fossil fuels. Woodside pointed to work done for the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that produces scenarios of how the world will decarbonise. Some of these show there will be a demand for oil in 2030 that is not met by existing fossil fuel projects. But the chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, says many of the modelled scenarios with higher levels of fossil fuel use also need “much higher levels of carbon dioxide removal that is likely unachievable and unsustainable”. Hare says Trion would release about 365Mt of CO2-e. A briefing document released by Woodside about the Trion project refers to the International Energy Agency’s scenario for how economies can reach net zero – but that analysis gives no room for new fossil fuel developments. The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, has pointed to a “black and white” contradiction for fossil fuel companies who claim increasing their production is in line with the Paris agreement. Hare tells Temperature Check: “Developing new oil and gas fields is completely inconsistent with getting to 1.5C and requires an almost infinite level of gullibility, wilful or otherwise, from investors and banks to believe and invest in this kind of magical thinking that sets aside as irrelevant or immaterial the increasingly strong analysis and messages from the world’s premier – and legendarily conservative – International Energy Agency.” Renewable coal? Climate activists have blockaded ports in Newcastle, Brisbane and Melbourne this week trying to disrupt the coal trade, causing some traffic jams and delays. Sky News Australia host Peta Credlin described it as “export terrorism” and suggested the government should ban the activists from accessing welfare. On Credlin’s show, the former Howard government minister Gary Hardgrave was confused about why protesters would be targeting coal. “Coal is a great renewable resource because the trees suck it out of the sky – that carbon dioxide – every night and turn it back into oxygen,” he said. The protesters should have sat with him in grade 6 where children “would have known how the balance of nature works”. “These people are unhinged. Simple,” Hardgrave said. One might ask why, if trees are sucking all coal’s carbon dioxide out of the sky, the gas continues to accumulate in the atmosphere, adding unfathomable amounts of extra heat to the oceans and driving worsening fire conditions in forests (where magic trees grow).'}, {'_id': '649409de51ac334b7fd25fd6', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/aristocrat-forced-to-open-part-of-estate-to-public-after-council-ruling', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Aristocrat forced to open part of estate to public after council ruling', 'lead': 'Hertfordshire council rules area of land on Hatfield House estate – owned by Marquess of Salisbury – is common land', 'author': 'Helena Horton Environment reporter', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 15:42:05', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:44:14.224098', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/eae213cc652dcfa0d4632262639cdef80c800075/0_187_5616_3370/500.jpg', 'body': 'The aristocrat who owns the country manor Hatfield House has been forced to allow the general public to walk on part of his estate after the local council ruled that it was common land. Earlier this year, the Marquess of Salisbury, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, opposed an application by the Open Spaces Society (OSS) to register a 1.8-hectare (4.45-acre) area of land on his estate as a common. Gascoyne-Cecil is a Conservative politician, once an MP and minister, and now sits in the Lords as a hereditary peer. Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, which was built by Gascoyne-Cecil’s ancestor the 1st Earl of Salisbury in 1611, is one of the UK’s biggest country homes. Some of its gardens are open to the paying public, and prices to visit start at £8 for the day. However, some land on the estate is now freely accessible after Hertfordshire county council granted a request to register it as common land. The area was determined to be common because it counts as “waste land of a manor” and under the law this means the public has access rights. The land, which comprises a mixture of grass, shrub and trees, has now been added to the common-land register, and the public has the right to walk there. Although it is almost 4 miles (6km) from his home, Gascoyne-Cecil objected to the application. Frances Kerner, the OSS’s commons re-registration officer, said: “I am delighted that the land at Wildhill Road has been added to the register of common land and that the public will be able to enjoy its beauty. “Ironically, the marquess recently hosted Future Countryside, an important conference tasked with discussing the many challenges faced by people who live in, work in and visit the countryside. Disappointingly, the society was not invited to the conference, but we hope that any future events held by the organisation will include the society and others who champion access to our splendid countryside.” In 1969, the land was provisionally registered as common but, according to the OSS, following an objection that year, the provisional registration was cancelled. It then was too late to register the land under the Commons Registration Act 1965. However, the Commons Act 2006 reopened the opportunity to rescue lost commons. Under paragraph 4 of schedule 2 to the Commons Act 2006 the excluded land became eligible for re-registration. The application, made by the society, to register the land duly provided evidence that the excluded land is waste land of a manor, which means that it can be registered as common land. According to the OSS, waste land of a manor is land of poor quality, which the lord or lady of the manor could not cultivate, and under the law this has been counted as common land. The council found that the tests in the 2006 Act had been met, and that the objection did not overcome these tests, and on that basis it amended the register. Hatfield House and the marquess declined to comment.'}, {'_id': '649409de51ac334b7fd25fe8', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/climate-campaigner-sarah-finch-takes-surrey-oil-drilling-case-to-supreme-court', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Climate campaigner takes Surrey oil drilling case to supreme court ', 'lead': 'Sarah Finch’s challenge to plans to allow oil well hinges on wider environmental impact of fossil fuels', 'author': 'Damien Gayle', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 14:32:56', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:44:14.224471', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e39c627cb529d7bbcbd10b10c30681b44caca896/0_197_5896_3538/500.jpg', 'body': 'Climate campaigners have begun a supreme court challenge to plans to drill for oil in Surrey, in a case they hope could set a precedent restricting plans for future fossil fuel projects in the UK. Sarah Finch is challenging Surrey county council’s decision to extend permission for a well at Horse Hill, near Gatwick airport in the Surrey countryside, which taps a subterranean reservoir developers believe may contain millions of barrels of oil. The case turns on the interpretation of rules surrounding planners’ drafting of environmental impact assessments. The campaigners argue that the planning committee that granted permission for the drilling erred because it only accounted for emissions arising from the drilling site itself, rather than those from the oils’ end use, when it is burned and most of the emissions produced. She has already lost in the high court and the court of appeal. On Wednesday morning, five supreme court justices, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt, Lady Rose, and Lord Richards, began hearing the case. A victory would have serious implications for future plans for oil and gas wells and coalmines in the UK, forcing planners to take into account the total emissions from any fossil fuels extracted, rather than merely the emissions from the extraction. Ahead of the case, Finch said: “The biggest climate impact from fossil fuel projects occurs when the fuel they produce is eventually burned. “It’s unbelievable that these ‘downstream’ GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions are ignored when planning decisions are made. I hope that the supreme court will give a clear ruling and end the dangerous lack of clarity on this point.” The proposed expansion of the Horse Hill site would include five drilling cellars, four hydrocarbon production wells, four gas-to-power generators, a process, storage and tanker loading area, seven 1,300-barrel oil tanks, and a 37-metre drill rig. Altogether, they would allow for the large-scale production of up to 3.3m tonnes of crude oil, for sale and use as transport fuel for the next 20 years. “It’s difficult to overstate the importance of this case,” said Rowan Smith, a solicitor with Leigh Day, who is representing Finch. “The supreme court will rule conclusively on whether or not the climate change impact of fossil fuel development in the UK must be taken into account before planning permissions are granted. There is a huge amount at stake for the future of the planet and the UK’s ability to meet its carbon reduction targets.” Lawyers for Surrey county council dispute Finch’s claim, arguing her approach to the interpretation of environmental impact requirements was “misguided”. Mr Justice Holgate considered the case in 2020 and dismissed Finch’s claim for a judicial review of planning permission granted by Surrey county council. Lord Justice Lewison, Sir Keith Lindblom and Lord Justice Moylan dismissed Finch’s appeal in 2022. Such is the significance of the case, West Cumbria mining, the company behind plans for a controversial new coalmine in Cumbria, has submitted its own intervention. The outcome of Finch’s case could seriously affect the future of the proposed mine, which as yet does not include downstream emissions in its impact assessment. Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Office for Environmental Protection have also intervened, on Finch’s behalf. Outside the supreme court on Wednesday, Danny Gross, a climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said the case was part of a long struggle to hold the fossil fuel industry to account. “It will set a crucial precedent that before any fossil fuel project goes ahead the full climate impacts need to be taken into account, because the emissions from extracting the fossil fuels are tiny in comparison to the emissions from burning them,” he said.'}, {'_id': '649409de51ac334b7fd25ff5', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/orca-rams-yacht-off-shetland-first-such-incident-northern-waters', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Orca rams into yacht off Shetland in first such incident in northern waters', 'lead': 'Cetacean exhibits same behaviour towards vessel in North Sea that has been seen in Iberian orca population', 'author': 'Philip Hoare and Jeroen Hoekendijk', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 13:27:45', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:44:14.224703', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/200f4e2bb0b1c109698da48bccd73a273410292a/275_0_4140_2484/500.jpg', 'body': 'An orca repeatedly rammed a yacht in the North Sea off Shetland on Monday, in a concerning development following previous interactions between the cetaceans and vessels in the strait of Gibraltar and Portugal. Dr Wim Rutten, a 72-year-old retired Dutch physicist and experienced yachtsperson, was sailing solo from Lerwick to Bergen in Norway. He was fishing for mackerel, with a single line off the back of the boat, when the orca suddenly appeared in the clear water, and hit the stern of the seven-ton boat. “I said: ‘Shit!’” Rutten, who said he had heard about the “Portuguese accidents”, told the Guardian. The whale hit again and again, creating “soft shocks” through the aluminium hull. “What I felt [was] most frightening was the very loud breathing of the animal,” he said. The orca stayed behind the boat “looking for the keel. Then he disappeared ... but came back at fast speed, twice or thrice ... and circled a bit. “Maybe he just wanted to play. Or look me in the eyes. Or to get rid of the fishing line.” This is the same behaviour that has been seen in the Iberian orca population, but it is the first time it has been known to happen in northern waters. Highly social cetaceans, orcas use complex vocalisations to communicate and to hunt for food, from small fish to blue whales. They learn matrilineally, and post-menopausal females assume the greatest importance in individual pods. “Grandmothers” in the Iberian population of whales have been seen observing during the interactions with yachts and other vessels. Experts believe this could be play among juvenile whales. Dr Alfredo López, of the Grupo de Trabajo Orca Atlántica in Portugal, said: “We know that many boats use fishing lines from the stern to fish and it is a motivation for orcas, they come to examine them.” But the focus on boats’ rudders may come from adult whales who have developed an aversion towards boats, perhaps because they “had a bad experience and try to stop the boat so as not to repeat it”. Most surprising is the fact that this learned behaviour should have appeared nearly 3,000 miles (4,800km) from Gibraltar. Dr Conor Ryan, a scientific adviser to the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, who has studied orca pods off the Scottish coast, said: “I’d be reluctant to say it cannot be learned from [the southern population]. It’s possible that this ‘fad’ is leapfrogging through the various pods/communities.” Ryan suggests there may be “highly mobile pods that could transmit this behaviour a long distance”. López thinks, however, “that human activities, even in an indirect way, are at the origin of this behaviour”.

The climate crisis is the biggest single threat we face as a global community. In turn, meeting the goals of the Paris agreement and realising the opportunities of climate action is the task of the 21st century. No single government can address this alone. Together, we can rise to the challenge. When leaders gathered in Bretton Woods in 1944 as the second world war was winding to its close, they set themselves a formidable task. Their job was to design an international financial system that would reduce global recessions and instability, and lead to a steadier international political environment than the one which bedevilled the first half of the 20th century. The result was imperfect, but nonetheless astounding. The creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund was played an important role in supporting a more stable period through the second half of the 20th century. If a new Bretton Woods system was being thrashed out today, there would no doubt be agreement that the present task is even greater than that of the 20th century – building a global financial architecture that helps the world stay as close as possible to 1.5C of warming. We, the climate change ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, hold hope that it is still possible to urgently correct course and see deep, rapid emissions reductions across all sectors and systems. But it is critical we create the right conditions for all nations to thrive, and not be left behind. We need a global financial architecture that helps address the existential threat of climate change, while supporting countries’ development ambitions, responding to the millions slipping back into poverty and maintaining stability in the global financial system. Pacific and Caribbean Island nations are showing us the way. Their leadership has been instrumental in driving global climate ambition, including to advocate for adequate and predictable flows of climate finance. The prime minister of the Cook Islands and chair of the Pacific Islands Forum, Mark Brown, recently called for “transformation in our multilateral development funds and institutions”. This reflects the shift that we agree is necessary. We are also inspired by the leadership of Barbados, whose prime minister, Mia Mottley, is a tireless advocate for international financial architecture reform to support the most climate-vulnerable nations. This includes small island states who face multiple, cascading challenges to their economic prospects because of climate change. Growing debt burdens are limiting the ability of developing countries to absorb the costs of addressing the devastating impacts of climate change on their own. That’s why we recognise the need to increase support for adaptation and the response to climate impacts in the developing world. We also call for developing countries to be directly engaged in these reform efforts. Our climate and development goals must be pursued in lockstep. Given their important role, multilateral development banks are uniquely placed to demonstrate leadership and our three nations welcome the delivery of initial reforms including the recent announcement to unlock US$50bn in lending capacity over the next 10 years at the World Bank. However, there is much more to do. Considering how urgent it is to provide climate finance at affordable rates, we need to make it a collective effort to ensure climate change becomes a bigger factor in the balance sheet of each multilateral development bank, recognising the importance that the banks retain their preferred creditor status and AAA credit rating. The reality is that climate finance from these multilateral institutions continues to be patchy and at times inaccessible to the nations that need it most – particularly those in the Pacific, and small island states around the world. We must change that. Climate finance that is inaccessible has little value. Multilateral development bank portfolios should increase alignment with the Paris agreement and scale up the provision of concessional finance. That means integrating climate risk considerations and impacts across their activities. It means strengthening efforts to leverage and unlock greater private sector investment off the back of interventions as well as streamlining access, eligibility and delivery of projects and programs. Now is a time of both challenge and opportunity. The summit for a new global financing pact is under way right now and it presents a time to focus on pathways to advance climate and nature-positive reforms across global financial architecture. So too, the World Bank and IMF annual meetings in Marrakech in October represent an opportunity to formalise the evolution of the World Bank, which we hope will deliver meaningful action. We also extend our support to the United Arab Emirates as the Cop28 president, expressing our joint ambition to work closely with UAE to make multilateral development bank reform a key focus of their presidency agenda. We all need to be “all in”. And that includes all international financial institutions. Chris Bowen is Australia’s climate change and energy minister. Steven Guilbeault is the Canadian minister of environment and climate change.

The flags are petals of an oriental poppy, Papaver orientale, in the Goliath group of species that may be called “Brilliant” or “Prince of Orange”. Depending on the intensity of light, it can flash through fiery red and sunset orange at the same time. The oriental species comes from the Caucasus, Iran and Turkey, and has appeared in gardens for centuries. These flowers are an explosion – dangerous, erotic, visionary. Oriental Poppies, painted by Georgia O’Keeffe in 1928, was groundbreaking, not just for its intense colour but for the textures of the flowers and their sense of movement. Maybe it also speaks of opium and sex magic, but it is a mesmerising image. It certainly has that effect on bees too. On this bright day in “flaming June”, after last night’s thunderstorm, the poppy flowers are full of garden bumblebees, Bombus hortorum, sometimes three or four in the same flower. Furry black-and-gold striped with white bums, the bees collide into the scarlet shimmer. Pulled by the visual lure of black patches inside the flower that give the illusion of dark, cavernous spaces, they crash into the rings of paddle-like stamens that carry a sable-purple pollen. These stamens skirt the curious seedhead structure with stigma of spidery, sticky-felt black arms, the diadem of the Mycenaean poppy goddess. The bumblebees have individual, high-pitched whines, like a kind of alarm or a magical note. Their wings vibrate the stamens at a certain frequency until the pollen baskets attached to their legs are full. The bees pull out of the flower to return to the nest. The pollen is potent enough and the bees do not receive nectar from the poppy. Like many bees, garden bumblebees have a cuckoo bee – an impostor species that steals the bee’s identity so that it can gain access to its nest to predate or exploit its colony. Bombus barbutellus looks very similar to Bombus hotorum, but has no pollen baskets on its legs; it steals from the labours of garden bumblebees. In the afternoon sun, the bees leave the poppies to their flames of riot and resurrection. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a914', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/22/thames-water-pipe-leaks-at-highest-level-in-five-years-foi-reveals', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Thames Water pipe leaks at highest level in five years, FOI reveals', 'lead': 'Water company to have regular meetings with environment secretary after failing to meet promised targets to fix leakage rates', 'author': 'Sandra Laville and Damian Carrington', 'datePublished': '2023-06-22 04:00:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560339', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/85747d40c0697998a5065e077ec6407e36d53cde/0_257_4800_2881/500.jpg', 'body': 'The leakage rate from Thames Water pipes is the highest for five years and the company will not meet its target to plug them this year, according to information released under freedom of information laws. The company, which serves 15 million customers across London and Thames Valley, has to have regular meetings with the environment secretary because it is considered to be lagging in its performance. Details of letters released under freedom of information laws between the CEO, Sarah Bentley, and Rebecca Pow, the environment secretary, reveal that Thames is not fixing its leaks as it has promised. Bentley told Pow: “Right now, we have the highest leakage rate since 2018. Consequently, we have already signalled to Ofwat that we are behind on our 2022/23 leakage performance and our target this year will now be very challenging to achieve. “As annual leakage targets are based on a three-year rolling average, the impact of this year will be felt, not just this year but for the next two years’ performance.” Thames is proposing controversial measures to tackle drought in the future, including a “recycling” scheme in which up to 100m litres of treated sewage from the Mogden sewage works will be pumped into the River Thames at Teddington, south-west London. This will replace 100m litres abstracted from the Thames to tackle water shortages. The project raises environmental concerns including increased water temperatures and a change in the salinity of the river, which will affect fish and biodiversity. It also involves digging three to four 10.5-metre shafts within a protected nature reserve, Ham Lands, a site of importance for nature conservation (SINC), according to Thames documents. The company is also proposing to transport 155m litres of water a day from Wales, in another sensitive policy to try to tackle water shortages in London and the south-east. But its failure to fix its own leaks – which are estimated to be 630m litres a day – is likely to make it more difficult for Thames to get approval for these proposals in its draft water resources management plan. Bentley blamed the hot, dry weather last summer, followed by a wet winter, for exacerbating leaks from the network and from customers’ homes. “The hot and dry summer created an unprecedented ‘soil moisture deficit’, with ground drying out and causing leaks in our pipes and customers’ pipes,” she said. “It also led to large increases in demand from our customers [in some areas and at sometimes up to 50% more during the summer]. This drove up ‘unmeasured consumption’ and the need for us to pump more water through our pipes at higher pressure to satisfy demand that in turn also led to more leaks from our pipes. “The re-wetting of the ground later in the autumn then caused further movement and more leaks in our pipes and customers’ pipes. More recently, the freezing temperatures before Christmas, followed by a speedy thaw, has resulted in a new surge of leaks – both on our water supply network and on our customer’s pipes.” Thames, like other water companies, has a target to cut its leaks by 50% by 2050. But the Environment Agency has called for the company to increase this target. The EA says the company needs to do more to tackle leaks before suggesting schemes including the Teddington water recycling plan and the transport of water from Wales. It has said the security of water supply to the south-east and London will be at risk if the company does not tackle its leaks and reduce customer demand for water. Bentley told Pow in her letter dated January this year that Thames was running a £1m communications campaign to highlight the challenges “we all face” and educate customers on what they can do to help make sure there is enough water for everyone. The government has set a target of reducing individual daily water use from about 144 litres a day to 110 litres a day by 2050. On its website, Thames Water admits it is not acceptable that so much water is being lost. It said it is doing all that is reasonably practical to reduce leakage but it will miss its 22/23 target, and that will affect future years. However, the company is working to improve its “leakage transformation plan”. A Defra spokesperson said: “We have been very clear to water companies that we expect them to deliver on their commitments – including targets to reduce leakage by 30% by 2032. “The government is taking a number of actions to improve water supply through our Plan for Water, as well as taking action to clean up our water through more investment, stronger regulation and tougher enforcement.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a915', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/22/woodside-has-huge-plans-to-drill-for-oil-and-gas-and-to-meet-its-climate-targets-how-does-it-do-it', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Woodside has huge plans to drill for oil and gas – and to meet its climate targets.

How? Woodside has said it “aims to thrive through the energy transition by building a low-cost, lower-carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio”. It has a 60% stake in the development, known as Trion, alongside Mexico’s state-owned oil exploration and production company, Pemex. Pemex discovered the oil and gas 2.5km deep, about 180km off shore in the Gulf of Mexico. There will be 24 wells and Pemex and Woodside are planning for the first oil to be pumped in 2028. Announcing the investment, Woodside pointed to analysis carried out for the UN’s climate science panel that it said showed there were “a range of future energy transition pathways” that allowed for new supply of fossil fuels while keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5C. Drilling for all this oil and gas in a new development would not even compromise the company’s climate targets, it said. But analysts told Temperature Check the Trion project would lead to the release of about 365m tonnes of CO2-equivalent over its lifetime – equal to about 80% of Australia’s annual emissions. How can Trion fit into Woodside’s climate targets? Most of the greenhouse gases from Trion will come when the oil and gas is burned and Woodside has no targets covering those emissions. Instead, the company says it will invest up to US$5bn in “new energy products and low-carbon services” by 2030. But that pledge is dwarfed by the money it is spending on fossil fuel production. Before announcing the US$4.8bn spend on Trion, the company said it planned to spend another US$6bn or so on an oilfield in Senegal and its Scarborough LNG project in Western Australia. Woodside does have targets for the emissions from its own operations (before the fossil fuels are sold and burned) but the company allows itself to buy offsets to meet them, which it did last year to turn a 3.5% rise in emissions into an 11% fall. Woodside thinks Trion will be financially “resilient” in a decarbonising world because it would make a quick return on investment and two-thirds of the fossil fuels would be extracted “within 10 years of start up”. The company said in its announcement it would use the cash from Trion to help fund “future developments in oil, gas and new energy” – a further pointer to the company’s hopes to keep exploiting fossil fuels. Woodside pointed to work done for the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that produces scenarios of how the world will decarbonise. Some of these show there will be a demand for oil in 2030 that is not met by existing fossil fuel projects. But the chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, says many of the modelled scenarios with higher levels of fossil fuel use also need “much higher levels of carbon dioxide removal that is likely unachievable and unsustainable”. Hare says Trion would release about 365Mt of CO2-e. A briefing document released by Woodside about the Trion project refers to the International Energy Agency’s scenario for how economies can reach net zero – but that analysis gives no room for new fossil fuel developments. The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, has pointed to a “black and white” contradiction for fossil fuel companies who claim increasing their production is in line with the Paris agreement. Hare tells Temperature Check: “Developing new oil and gas fields is completely inconsistent with getting to 1.5C and requires an almost infinite level of gullibility, wilful or otherwise, from investors and banks to believe and invest in this kind of magical thinking that sets aside as irrelevant or immaterial the increasingly strong analysis and messages from the world’s premier – and legendarily conservative – International Energy Agency.” Renewable coal? Climate activists have blockaded ports in Newcastle, Brisbane and Melbourne this week trying to disrupt the coal trade, causing some traffic jams and delays. Sky News Australia host Peta Credlin described it as “export terrorism” and suggested the government should ban the activists from accessing welfare. On Credlin’s show, the former Howard government minister Gary Hardgrave was confused about why protesters would be targeting coal. “Coal is a great renewable resource because the trees suck it out of the sky – that carbon dioxide – every night and turn it back into oxygen,” he said. The protesters should have sat with him in grade 6 where children “would have known how the balance of nature works”. “These people are unhinged. Simple,” Hardgrave said. One might ask why, if trees are sucking all coal’s carbon dioxide out of the sky, the gas continues to accumulate in the atmosphere, adding unfathomable amounts of extra heat to the oceans and driving worsening fire conditions in forests (where magic trees grow).'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a916', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/21/aristocrat-forced-to-open-part-of-estate-to-public-after-council-ruling', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Aristocrat forced to open part of estate to public after council ruling', 'lead': 'Hertfordshire council rules area of land on Hatfield House estate – owned by Marquess of Salisbury – is common land', 'author': 'Helena Horton Environment reporter', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 15:42:05', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560381', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/eae213cc652dcfa0d4632262639cdef80c800075/0_187_5616_3370/500.jpg', 'body': 'The aristocrat who owns the country manor Hatfield House has been forced to allow the general public to walk on part of his estate after the local council ruled that it was common land. Earlier this year, the Marquess of Salisbury, Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, opposed an application by the Open Spaces Society (OSS) to register a 1.8-hectare (4.45-acre) area of land on his estate as a common. Gascoyne-Cecil is a Conservative politician, once an MP and minister, and now sits in the Lords as a hereditary peer. Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, which was built by Gascoyne-Cecil’s ancestor the 1st Earl of Salisbury in 1611, is one of the UK’s biggest country homes. Some of its gardens are open to the paying public, and prices to visit start at £8 for the day. However, some land on the estate is now freely accessible after Hertfordshire county council granted a request to register it as common land. The area was determined to be common because it counts as “waste land of a manor” and under the law this means the public has access rights. The land, which comprises a mixture of grass, shrub and trees, has now been added to the common-land register, and the public has the right to walk there. Although it is almost 4 miles (6km) from his home, Gascoyne-Cecil objected to the application. Frances Kerner, the OSS’s commons re-registration officer, said: “I am delighted that the land at Wildhill Road has been added to the register of common land and that the public will be able to enjoy its beauty. “Ironically, the marquess recently hosted Future Countryside, an important conference tasked with discussing the many challenges faced by people who live in, work in and visit the countryside. Disappointingly, the society was not invited to the conference, but we hope that any future events held by the organisation will include the society and others who champion access to our splendid countryside.” In 1969, the land was provisionally registered as common but, according to the OSS, following an objection that year, the provisional registration was cancelled. It then was too late to register the land under the Commons Registration Act 1965. However, the Commons Act 2006 reopened the opportunity to rescue lost commons. Under paragraph 4 of schedule 2 to the Commons Act 2006 the excluded land became eligible for re-registration. The application, made by the society, to register the land duly provided evidence that the excluded land is waste land of a manor, which means that it can be registered as common land. According to the OSS, waste land of a manor is land of poor quality, which the lord or lady of the manor could not cultivate, and under the law this has been counted as common land. The council found that the tests in the 2006 Act had been met, and that the objection did not overcome these tests, and on that basis it amended the register.

Sarah Finch is challenging Surrey county council’s decision to extend permission for a well at Horse Hill, near Gatwick airport in the Surrey countryside, which taps a subterranean reservoir developers believe may contain millions of barrels of oil. The case turns on the interpretation of rules surrounding planners’ drafting of environmental impact assessments. The campaigners argue that the planning committee that granted permission for the drilling erred because it only accounted for emissions arising from the drilling site itself, rather than those from the oils’ end use, when it is burned and most of the emissions produced. She has already lost in the high court and the court of appeal. On Wednesday morning, five supreme court justices, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt, Lady Rose, and Lord Richards, began hearing the case. A victory would have serious implications for future plans for oil and gas wells and coalmines in the UK, forcing planners to take into account the total emissions from any fossil fuels extracted, rather than merely the emissions from the extraction. Ahead of the case, Finch said: “The biggest climate impact from fossil fuel projects occurs when the fuel they produce is eventually burned. “It’s unbelievable that these ‘downstream’ GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions are ignored when planning decisions are made. I hope that the supreme court will give a clear ruling and end the dangerous lack of clarity on this point.” The proposed expansion of the Horse Hill site would include five drilling cellars, four hydrocarbon production wells, four gas-to-power generators, a process, storage and tanker loading area, seven 1,300-barrel oil tanks, and a 37-metre drill rig. Altogether, they would allow for the large-scale production of up to 3.3m tonnes of crude oil, for sale and use as transport fuel for the next 20 years. “It’s difficult to overstate the importance of this case,” said Rowan Smith, a solicitor with Leigh Day, who is representing Finch. “The supreme court will rule conclusively on whether or not the climate change impact of fossil fuel development in the UK must be taken into account before planning permissions are granted. There is a huge amount at stake for the future of the planet and the UK’s ability to meet its carbon reduction targets.” Lawyers for Surrey county council dispute Finch’s claim, arguing her approach to the interpretation of environmental impact requirements was “misguided”. Mr Justice Holgate considered the case in 2020 and dismissed Finch’s claim for a judicial review of planning permission granted by Surrey county council. Lord Justice Lewison, Sir Keith Lindblom and Lord Justice Moylan dismissed Finch’s appeal in 2022. Such is the significance of the case, West Cumbria mining, the company behind plans for a controversial new coalmine in Cumbria, has submitted its own intervention. The outcome of Finch’s case could seriously affect the future of the proposed mine, which as yet does not include downstream emissions in its impact assessment. Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Office for Environmental Protection have also intervened, on Finch’s behalf. Outside the supreme court on Wednesday, Danny Gross, a climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said the case was part of a long struggle to hold the fossil fuel industry to account. “It will set a crucial precedent that before any fossil fuel project goes ahead the full climate impacts need to be taken into account, because the emissions from extracting the fossil fuels are tiny in comparison to the emissions from burning them,” he said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a918', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/orca-rams-yacht-off-shetland-first-such-incident-northern-waters', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Orca rams into yacht off Shetland in first such incident in northern waters', 'lead': 'Cetacean exhibits same behaviour towards vessel in North Sea that has been seen in Iberian orca population', 'author': 'Philip Hoare and Jeroen Hoekendijk', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 13:27:45', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560433', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/200f4e2bb0b1c109698da48bccd73a273410292a/275_0_4140_2484/500.jpg', 'body': 'An orca repeatedly rammed a yacht in the North Sea off Shetland on Monday, in a concerning development following previous interactions between the cetaceans and vessels in the strait of Gibraltar and Portugal. Dr Wim Rutten, a 72-year-old retired Dutch physicist and experienced yachtsperson, was sailing solo from Lerwick to Bergen in Norway. He was fishing for mackerel, with a single line off the back of the boat, when the orca suddenly appeared in the clear water, and hit the stern of the seven-ton boat. “I said: ‘Shit!’” Rutten, who said he had heard about the “Portuguese accidents”, told the Guardian. The whale hit again and again, creating “soft shocks” through the aluminium hull. “What I felt [was] most frightening was the very loud breathing of the animal,” he said. The orca stayed behind the boat “looking for the keel. Then he disappeared ... but came back at fast speed, twice or thrice ... and circled a bit. “Maybe he just wanted to play. Or look me in the eyes. Or to get rid of the fishing line.” This is the same behaviour that has been seen in the Iberian orca population, but it is the first time it has been known to happen in northern waters. Highly social cetaceans, orcas use complex vocalisations to communicate and to hunt for food, from small fish to blue whales. They learn matrilineally, and post-menopausal females assume the greatest importance in individual pods. “Grandmothers” in the Iberian population of whales have been seen observing during the interactions with yachts and other vessels. Experts believe this could be play among juvenile whales. Dr Alfredo López, of the Grupo de Trabajo Orca Atlántica in Portugal, said: “We know that many boats use fishing lines from the stern to fish and it is a motivation for orcas, they come to examine them.” But the focus on boats’ rudders may come from adult whales who have developed an aversion towards boats, perhaps because they “had a bad experience and try to stop the boat so as not to repeat it”. Most surprising is the fact that this learned behaviour should have appeared nearly 3,000 miles (4,800km) from Gibraltar. Dr Conor Ryan, a scientific adviser to the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, who has studied orca pods off the Scottish coast, said: “I’d be reluctant to say it cannot be learned from [the southern population]. It’s possible that this ‘fad’ is leapfrogging through the various pods/communities.” Ryan suggests there may be “highly mobile pods that could transmit this behaviour a long distance”. López thinks, however, “that human activities, even in an indirect way, are at the origin of this behaviour”. Increased marine traffic, dwindling food sources, warming seas and noise pollution could all play a part. Rutten added: “Maybe the universe knows.

Onboard the ship was an array of scientific monitoring equipment, cameras and a sleek, 22ft-long submersible named Titan. The passengers onboard the chartered Polar Prince vessel were excited at the prospect of reaching the final resting site of the RMS Titanic, even if it meant cramming themselves inside the hollow body of Titan. But the small carbon fibre craft disappeared on Sunday, nearly two hours after it dipped below the surface, en route to the remains of the sunken ocean liner. The disappearance has prompted a frantic international search, with Canada and the US marshalling all available resources in a race against time. The Titanic never reached its destination of New York City. But along the east coast of Canada, the legacy of the doomed ship still looms large more than a century after it sank. More than 120 victims of the disaster are buried in the Fairview cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia – at the time the city nearest to the sinking with rail and shipping connections. The city’s Museum of the Atlantic showcases artifacts from the ship, including a deck chair, personal effects and wreckage, as well as the white canvas mortuary bags used for the victims. St John’s, Canada’s easternmost city in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, remains the closest city to the liner’s final resting place and has become the launching site for expeditions traveling to the wreck site, nearly 400 miles (650km) away – and more than 12,000ft (3,800m) below the surface of the ocean. On Tuesday, the city, known for its brightly coloured “biscuit box” houses, was blanketed in a thick haze of fog and rain as residents made sense of the news. “To hear that there are people in distress possibly and not knowing where they are and if we’re ever going to find them … it’s heart-wrenching,” said Anne Simmons, operations manager at a local tour company. “The whole world is watching because it’s the Titanic. Everybody knows about it.” On April 1912, the Titanic received warnings of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Hours later, a remote Marconi wireless station on the south-east tip of the island received the Titanic’s first distress call. St John’s is also home to Memorial University and the world-class Marine Institute research centre, which recently announced a partnership with OceanGate, the American company behind the missing submersible. Friday’s mission was the company’s fifth Titanic expedition. Onboard were Hamish Harding, 58, a British explorer and pilot who has previously taken a suborbital spaceflight; British Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48; and Dawood’s son Suleman, 19. “Due to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023. A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow,” Harding posted on Instagram on Saturday. “We started steaming from St John’s, Newfoundland, Canada, yesterday and are planning to start dive operations around 4am tomorrow morning. Until then we have a lot of preparations and briefings to do.” Paul Henri Nargeolet, a deep diver, submersible pilot, former French navy commander and a leading authority on the Titanic wreck site, is also believed to have been onboard alongside Stockton Rush, the founder of OceanGate. On Tuesday, St John’s harbour was blanketed in a thick cover of fog. Out on the ocean, challenging conditions have hampered the search efforts. “I don’t believe anybody should just be able to build their own submarine and head off into the world without the skills or talents to do so because then you know tragedies like this do happen,” said resident Ashton Quinn. “I feel very bad for the families of the people involved.” As the search intensifies, there is collective hope the vessel can be located. The province is no stranger to disaster – it took in 75 airplanes when airspace was closed during 9/11, an act of generosity celebrated in the hit Broadway musical Come From Away – nor is it a stranger to loss. Generations of fishers have left the rocky shores of the region, only to be lost at sea. “I kind of feel for the people’s family and for what they may be going through right now. It’s really really a tough circumstance,” said resident Bruce Keating. “The natural instinct for everybody here … is just to rally around and provide whatever support they can, [knowing] how dangerous the ocean can be.” • This article was amended on 21 June 2023 to correct the spelling of Suleman Dawood’s name; and to clarify that 75 airplanes landed in Newfoundland on 9/11, not 38 as an earlier version had it.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a91a', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/are-debt-for-nature-swaps-way-forward-for-conservation-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Are debt-for-nature swaps the way forward for conservation?', 'lead': 'Agreements to reduce developing countries’ debt burden in exchange for spending on nature will be on the agenda at a finance summit in Paris this week', 'author': 'Patrick Greenfield', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 06:30:05', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560495', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/6935d962ef10c358fb1c61dbcfa0e7af1fac257c/0_280_9504_5702/500.jpg', 'body': 'After decades in the wilderness, and familiar to only those in the know, “debt-for-nature swaps” are becoming one of the hottest things in conservation finance. Last month, Ecuador struck the biggest deal of its kind: refinancing $1.6bn (£1.3bn) of its commercial debt at a discount in exchange for a consistent revenue stream for conservation around the Galápagos Islands. Other nature-rich countries that are struggling to pay their debts have taken notice and deals are rumoured in Gabon and Sri Lanka. The market for debt-for-nature swaps is poised to exceed $800bn, according to Bloomberg, prompting fierce competition between banks as demand for green investments increases. Debt-for-nature swaps mean reducing a developing country’s debt burden in exchange for guaranteed finance for nature. Supporters of the concept – which has its roots in the 1980s debt crisis and an idea from the late “father of biodiversity”, Thomas Lovejoy – say it is a win-win for financiers, countries and conservationists. This week, the subject will be on the agenda at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris, spearheaded by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Barbados entered into its own $150m debt-for-nature deal in 2021. “The world is facing a biodiversity, climate and debt crisis, which is even more pronounced in the developing world,” says Slav Gatchev, managing director of sustainable debt for the Nature Conservancy (TNC), which is often involved in facilitating deals. “There is an overlap between biodiversity hotspots in the tropics and excessive levels of debt,” he says. “Typically, countries approach us because they’ve seen that these deals can be done at scale. “You can move the needle in terms of financial pinch points, resolving liquidity constraints before they become solvency problems and, because of our role as a conservation organisation, we can be an honest broker when it comes to implementing these programmes on the ground.” But detractors of the deals warn of greenwashing, and have criticised agreements in which banks often take large fees with comparatively small amounts going to conservation. In a note to investors in January, Barclays questioned the green credentials of debt-for-nature swaps – often sold as ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments – because only a small fraction of the deal size ends up with conservation. This claim is strongly disputed by the banks involved. Separately, Daniel Ortega Pacheco, a former Ecuadorian environment minister, is concerned about the potential implications of the agreements for sovereignty. Last month’s Galápagos agreement requires Ecuador to provide about $18m a year to conserve waters near the islands, mostly for a new Hermandad marine reserve that hosts whale sharks, blue whales and leatherback turtles. “When you take a closer look at nature-for-debt swaps, Moody’s actually says they count as a default. [A deal] might prejudice developing countries in the long term and there are restrictions on how the money can be spent. Even after the second world war, Germany was free to decide where to invest,” he says. The concerns are echoed by Katie Kedward, a UCL research fellow, who says the agreements do not go far enough. “The pandemic has brought debt restructuring back into the conversation. In terms of sovereign debt burdens, those constraints are preventing countries from investing in conservation and adaptation to the increased risks of climate change. “I would argue that we need to go further and look at debt forgiveness. I am hugely sceptical about how debt-for-nature swaps are being implemented in practice,” she says. Gatchev says these concerns are unfounded, pointing to case studies by TNC of deals in Belize and Barbados, which he says show that the benefit accrues to the countries. The deals are specific to the requirements of each country and try to anticipate potential problems. The Belize agreement includes natural disaster insurance, intended to avoid the scenario where the country is forced to pay for conservation instead of rebuilding after a hurricane. The reasons for entering the agreements bear striking parallels to the arguments of Lovejoy in 1984, when the idea was first developed. “As debtor nations cut back on government spending, programmes for protecting natural resources are among the first to go,” Lovejoy wrote in the New York Times at the time. “Costa Rica’s superb national park system cannot be staffed or enlarged without private donations from outside the country. “Brazil’s equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency can do little more than pay the salaries of its employees; when fires recently broke out in its national park system, there were few guards around to fight them,” he said. In Paris, Mia Mottley’s Bridgetown agenda will attempt to reform global finance for the environmental crises of the modern age. For some, the nature-for-debt swap is part of the answer.

It found people recently exposed to dirtier air before contracting the illness spent four days longer in hospital, the same impact as on those 10 years their senior. The Belgian study also showed that air pollution levels measured in patients’ blood were linked to a 36% increase in the risk of needing intensive care treatment. A separate study in Denmark showed air pollution exposure was linked to a 23% increase in the risk of death from Covid-19. In both studies, the level of air pollution was below legal EU standards. Previous research suggested that air pollution worsened Covid outcomes but, rather than assessing groups of people together, the new studies followed individual patients and therefore give much more confidence in the results. Air pollution is known to be a major risk factor in aggravating respiratory diseases. It increases inflammation in the lungs and weakens immune defences, and causes pre-existing lung problems that worsen the outcomes of new infections. The new research shows cutting air pollution is a crucial measure for reducing illness and deaths during future outbreaks of respiratory diseases, including the annual flu season. Cleaner air brought health benefits almost as great as some of the medical treatments given to the Covid-19 patients, the research showed. “Reducing air pollution, even when at relatively low levels, increases the health of the population and makes them less susceptible to future pandemics,” said Prof Tim Nawrot, at Hasselt University in Belgium. “The pandemic placed an enormous strain on doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers. Our research suggests that air pollution made that burden even greater.” Dr Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and senior author of the Danish study, said: “These results show how air pollution can compromise our immune system and leave us vulnerable. Reduction of air pollution should be at the heart of preventive measures for current and future pandemics, as well as a strategy for dealing with seasonal influenza pandemics.” Many previous studies assessing the link between Covid and air pollution were what epidemiologists call “ecological studies”, which assess the relationship using averaged data for a whole population. These could be completed quickly and some factors that may influence the link could be taken into account. But hidden factors could not be ruled out and the variation of air pollution over short distances could not be accounted for. In contrast, the new studies followed the illness and air pollution exposure in individual people. The Belgian study, published in the European Respiratory Journal (ERJ), followed more than 300 patients who were hospitalised with Covid-19 between May 2020 and March 2021. Data on the levels of three pollutants – fine particles, nitrogen dioxide and soot – at the patients’ homes were gathered and the amount of soot in the patients’ blood was also measured. Other factors known to affect Covid-19 disease, such as age, sex and weight, were taken into account. The difference in air pollution used in the studies to assess the impact on Covid-19 was based on the range of pollution levels recorded. The higher level used was midway towards the top of the range – at the 75% mark – and the lower level was towards the bottom of the range – at the 25% mark. The researchers found people exposed to the higher level a week before hospital admission went on to spend about four more days in hospital. They also found the lower level of air pollution resulted in health improvements equivalent to 40-80% of the benefits of medicines used to treat Covid, such as remdesivir. The Danish study, also published in the ERJ, used Denmark’s national Covid-19 surveillance system to follow all 3.7 million people in the country aged 30 or older over the first 14 months of the pandemic. It found patients exposed to the higher level of small particle air pollution in 2019 were about 23% more likely to go on to die from Covid-19. A similar recent study in New York City found the increased risk of death was 11%. Prof Charlotte Suppli Ulrik, head of the European Respiratory Society assembly on the environment and epidemiology, said: “We are finding more and more evidence that breathing polluted air is contributing to lung diseases, including infections. Although the Covid-19 global health emergency is over, the impact of pollution on our health is continuing and we need governments to take action for the sake of our health and our health services.” Prof Jordi Sunyer and Dr Payam Dadvand, at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health and commenting on the Belgian study, said it showed that cutting air pollution would be “a very effective way to protect our population” from Covid-19 and other respiratory infections. “Despite the evidence, the air quality standards are still above harmful values and even these rather lax standards are still not met in most cities in the world, including many European cities,” they said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a91c', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/country-diary-the-hay-harvest-has-begun-and-the-air-is-vanilla-sweet', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: The hay harvest has begun, and the air is vanilla-sweet | Kate Blincoe', 'lead': '<strong>Caistor St Edmund, Norfolk:</strong> We badly need rain on the farm, just not for the next five days', 'author': 'Kate Blincoe', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 04:30:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560554', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e8098e8ee7e7c58e366f73886e119f15004f6ee6/0_605_4032_2419/500.jpg', 'body': 'Like sentinels guarding a spot, three red kites slowly stir in the sky. My eyes trace downwards to a cloud of dust swirling up like a portal. A neighbouring farm has started cutting the long grass to make hay. As the habitat is razed, wildlife will be scattering – voles, mice, deer, hares. Back at High Ash farm, my brother consults the forecast. Should he too be cutting the hay? It’s a high-risk crop. Most harvests remove the produce off the land the second it is cut, safely into the barn. With hay, you leave it on the ground at the mercy of the weather, where it requires five sunny days to dry out fully. Overnight, the dismal grey cloud that has shrouded Norfolk vanishes. The decision is made to cut a few fields and the machinery roars into action. Wildlife here takes precedence. All the wildflower “pollen and nectar” mixes will be left untouched until late August. Early cutting of hay is not ideal from a wildlife perspective, but nature-friendly mowing practices help reduce the impact. This includes cutting the field from the centre outwards, and having other uncut fields where animals can flee to. By contrast, in my dad’s boyhood, terriers and lurchers would have been on hand to catch escaping creatures. Later, as I stroll across the freshly mown field, just a solitary red kite overhead, I inhale that distinctive sweet, almost vanilla hay aroma that epitomises summer. The scent is known as “coumarin” and is found in sweet vernal grass. It becomes more aromatic as it dries. Coumarin has even been synthesised for use in best-selling designer fragrances. Going back a century or so, half this farm was hay crop, grown to fuel the working horses that laboured on the land. Today, it is needed for leisure horses. The irony is that many owners will need to soak the nutritious, energy-rich hay to remove sugars and avoid overweight horses. This summer, we’re heading into drought conditions, with young trees already dead or showing signs of stress. But just for a few days we stop hoping for rain.

The research, which measured benzene levels in 87 homes in California and Colorado, found that gas and propane stoves frequently emitted benzene at rates well above healthy benchmarks set by the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Leaving a single gas hob on for 45 minutes raised benzene levels to above that found in secondhand tobacco smoking, or at the boundary of oil and gas plants, with emissions 10 to 25 times higher than that from electric coil stoves. Even low-burning hobs, or gas oven use, emit significant levels of benzene. Induction stoves emit no benzene at all, the researchers found. The peer-reviewed study, led by scientists at Stanford University, is the first to use new monitors to effectively measure benzene indoors. Even low doses of airborne benzene raise the risk of a variety of cancers, including lymphomas and leukemia, by damaging people’s bone marrow. Elevated levels of benzene can linger for six hours throughout a house or apartment after a gas stove is turned off. “I’m hard-pressed to think of a more powerful chemical cause of leukemia than benzene,” said Jan Kirsch, a California-based oncologist who said that people had in their homes a “very potent” cause of blood cell cancers. “People have died, undoubtably, from exposure to benzene in their homes and unless this problem is ameliorated people will continue to do so,” Kirsch said. “The idea is not to cause panic, but there are risks and we want to reduce them. It’s important this message is carried to the public, so we can understand and act on it.” More than a third of households in the US use gas stoves, although many lack adequate ventilation to help reduce dangerous levels of benzene, the researchers said. Range hoods, even when they are used, often just circulate air around a dwelling rather than expel the harmful chemicals. The result is indoor air hazards that often rival, or even exceed, the sort of outdoor air pollution that has been reduced through clean air regulations over the past 50 years. Gas stoves “are the only common fossil fuel appliance to vent pollution indoors”, said Rob Jackson, a scientist at Stanford who helped lead the new research. “We would never willingly stand over the tailpipe of a car, breathing in its pollution, but we do willingly stand over our stoves, breathing in the pollution they emit,” he added. Decades of previous research has highlighted the dangers posed by a stew of different emissions, including carbon monoxide and formaldehyde, that come from the burning of gas indoors. A study from earlier this year found that gas stoves are responsible for more than 12% of all childhood asthma cases in the US, with separate research discovering that a series of different pollutants are expelled from gas stoves, even after they are turned off. Joe Biden’s administration has attempted to formulate efficiency standards for new stoves to lower such pollution, with around half of all stoves currently sold likely to fail the proposed safeguards. Several states, such as New York, have moved to phase out gas appliances in new buildings, too. This has provoked a furious political backlash, however, with Ron DeSantis, the Republican presidential hopeful, seeking to prevent any sort of gas stove ban in Florida, the state in which he is governor. Republicans in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate, meanwhile, have pushed forward legislation that would prohibit the banning of gas stoves. “Nothing is off limits to the radical left’s Green New Deal agenda,” said Markwayne Mullin, a Republican senator who signed onto the bill last week to “get Washington out of our kitchens and our pocketbooks”. Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat from West Virginia, has joined with the Republicans, complaining last week that the “federal government has no business telling Americans how to cook their dinner”. Stanford’s Jackson pointed out that there is no proposal to remove people’s existing gas stoves but that it made sense to encourage the adoption of cleaner-burning appliances when stove purchases are made in order to protect public health. “We should incentivize the use of induction stoves, particularly in lower-income communities,” he said. “We stopped cooking over coal a century ago in the US because gas is cleaner and today I believe we should eventually stop cooking over gas because electricity is cleaner. We have a cleaner technology available today.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a91e', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/rewetting-englands-lowland-peat-could-help-meet-emissions-target-says-study', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Rewetting England’s lowland peat could help meet emissions target, says study', 'lead': 'Thinktank suggests projects could deliver one-fifth of savings needed from farming, but agriculture experts cast doubt on idea', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-20 14:00:35', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560602', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/53c18e87cb1df442c896c30ca2d4d2a79dc0a25d/0_425_3500_2100/500.jpg', 'body': 'Rewetting about half of England’s lowland peat would be enough to deliver a fifth of the greenhouse gas emissions savings needed from the country’s farming by 2030, research suggests. Rewetting peat would also help restore habitats for birds, wildlife and plant species. But farming experts strongly dispute the potential for such projects. Food grown on lowland peat in England has a much higher carbon footprint than imports of soya from Brazil, according to the research, from the Green Alliance thinktank. That is because wet peat sequesters carbon, but when peat is drained and farmed it emits about 19 times as much carbon as non-peat cropland. The Green Alliance said the findings showed that rewetting peat, through removing drainage or building dams to retain water on the land, should be a government priority. Lowland peat occupies only about 1% of the UK’s farmland, so even if half were rewetted it would have little impact on land availability, according to the analysis, but make a substantial contribution to the UK’s efforts to reach net zero. However, farmers said drained peatlands – including the fens of East Anglia – were some of the UK’s most productive farmland, so a simple comparison of land area would not reflect their true value. Farming is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions but so far government efforts to reduce agricultural emissions have not produced the changes needed. Farmers could be given stronger incentives to rewet lowland peat on their farms through the government’s environmental land management schemes, as current incentives appear ineffective, according to the Green Alliance analysis. Lydia Collas, the author of the research at Green Alliance, said: “In its natural form, lowland peat can support a huge range of wetland species and absorb significant rainfall, preventing flooding downstream. “Everyone knows that clearing Brazilian rainforest for soya production is a disaster for the climate and for nature, but we’re sabotaging our own environment by growing grain on lowland peat.” Farmers were unconvinced, however. Aidan Gill, an environment policy adviser at the National Farmers’ Union, said the impacts on food of rewetting peat could be substantial, depending on the areas affected. “The highly productive East Anglian fens produce more than 7% of England’s total agricultural production, worth £1.2bn, so rewetting peat soils [there] would be quite a significant land use change and have a big impact on UK food security,” he said. He added that there were many practical obstacles, as fields could not be rewetted in isolation, and there was a risk of flooding to surrounding areas. Gareth Morgan, the head of farming policy at the Soil Association, also urged caution. “The fens are crucial for rural communities and domestic food production, supplying a third of British-grown vegetables. “A poorly thought-out change in land management on the fens could increase reliance on imports, weakening the resilience of our local food systems, and contributing to emissions and habitat loss abroad,” he told the Guardian. He said the Soil Association agreed that rewetting peat in some areas was needed but called on the government to “work with local farmers and use their expert knowledge of the land to adopt a mosaic approach that maintains nature-friendly farming in the most suitable areas while rewetting and restoring peatlands in others”. “A one-size-fits-all approach will be inappropriate,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We made clear in our plan for water that reducing emissions from peatlands will require rewetting – and are committed to working with farmers and other land managers to halt the degradation of our lowland peat soils. “Later this year, we will launch a £6.6m lowland peat research and development programme to help us identify the best way to reduce emissions from peatlands.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a91f', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/uk-supermarket-suppliers-chickens-given-antibiotics-critical-for-humans', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'UK supermarket supplier’s chickens given antibiotics critical for humans', 'lead': 'Investigation of meat sourced by Polish firm that sells frozen poultry to Lidl, Asda and Iceland raises superbug concerns', 'author': 'Misbah Khan, Andrew Wasley and Agata Skrzypczyk', 'datePublished': '2023-06-20 12:00:33', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560630', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/40d9bdb5a994c76c561d43c26072cdfbd5b99f3c/0_76_5520_3312/500.jpg', 'body': 'A major supplier of chicken to UK supermarkets is sourcing birds dosed with antibiotics “critical to human health”, according to a new investigation, as concerns grow about the spread of deadly superbugs. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) found that the Polish meat business SuperDrob, which sells frozen poultry products to Lidl, Asda and Iceland, is sourcing chicken from farms that use fluoroquinolone antibiotics, classified as “critically important for human health” by the World Health Organization (WHO). Fluoroquinolones are often used to treat serious salmonella infections in humans. Giving antibiotics to animals has come under increasing scrutiny, as scientists highlight the risks of potentially lethal bacteria developing antibiotic resistance, meaning drugs may no longer work to treat human infections. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria – known as “superbugs” – are a growing threat to human health, leading to an estimated 1.2 million deaths globally in 2019. There are growing concerns that farmers giving these critically important antibiotics to their animals may contribute to the problem. To reduce the risk of superbug outbreaks, the EU tightened up laws about the use of antibiotics on farms last year. Yet it appears that the use of drugs critical for human health on farms in Poland, Europe’s biggest producer of poultry meat, has soared in recent years. Sales of fluoroquinolones have increased by more than 70% in the country. Data shows even larger increases in the sales of colistin, a last-resort drug used to treat serious infections that have not responded to other medicines. The WHO classifies both as critically important for human health. SuperDrob is one of Poland’s leading poultry producers and more than 50% of its revenue is from exports. Three sources, including a farmer who supplies chicken to SuperDrob and a vet who serves supplying farms, confirmed that fluoroquinolone antibiotics were being used, according to interviews conducted by the BIJ. There is nothing unlawful about this but testing undertaken by the BIJ, overseen by an Oxford University academic, in May discovered bacteria resistant to fluoroquinolones in samples of waste collected from a number of Polish poultry farms that are understood to have supplied SuperDrob. SuperDrob said the drugs were in use, but that it had firm policies in place to ensure they were only used when justified. It said: “Where there is a veterinary need for medical treatment, then it is used under the supervision of veterinarians.” The company also said it was reducing the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics and would phase them out by 2025. Tim Walsh, a professor of medical microbiology at Oxford University, said he believed there had been a failure at an EU level to monitor antibiotic use in Poland, and that the country’s soaring sales of high-priority antibiotics should have raised alarm bells. But the European Commission said that measures taken in Poland since a UK salmonella outbreak in 2020, including improved biosecurity on farms and better hygiene in meat plants, had resulted in a reduction of salmonella contaminations. Although fluoroquinolone antibiotics are legal to use on chicken farms in the UK and EU under veterinary supervision, their use is now tightly controlled by regulators and they are not allowed to be used preventively on healthy animals. SuperDrob said its policies did not permit the use of antibiotics for prophylactic purposes and such behaviour was also prohibited for SuperDrob’s suppliers. The Polish chief veterinary inspectorate said the prophylactic – or preventive – use of antibiotics was not common practice in Poland. In 2020, EU and UK authorities identified SuperDrob meat plants and farms as the main source of the UK salmonella outbreak that infected more than 400 people. The BIJ looked at genetic sequences from bacteria responsible for the outbreak and found that most were resistant to fluoroquinolones and in some instances, samples were also found to be resistant to multiple drugs, making infections even more difficult to treat. SuperDrob said that at the time of the outbreak the industry was supervised by the state, but that it had introduced its own system for the control of salmonella which had been developed by poultry disease and quality department specialists. It said it had also varied the contracts with its breeders to ensure that these systems were in place at their facilities. No similar instances had been detected in its products since March 2021. Asda said all its imported frozen poultry products went through rigorous safety and quality checks. Iceland Foods said it prohibited its suppliers from prophylactically using antibiotics that were critical for treating diseases in humans. Lidl also said its suppliers were prohibited from using antibiotics as a preventive measure. Asda said customers should always thoroughly cook frozen chicken products to reduce the risk of getting ill.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a920', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/climate-crisis-hit-poor-countries-should-have-debt-relief-says-imf-chief', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Debt relief urgent for poor countries hit by climate shocks, says IMF chief ', 'lead': 'Exclusive: Kristalina Georgieva calls for ‘debt for climate swaps’ ahead of world summit on new global financial pact', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-20 11:06:35', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560657', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0661f22fe3cf9a98ccf71c323608d45abffe9315/0_186_5568_3341/500.jpg', 'body': 'Poor countries hit by climate disaster should not be forced to struggle with crippling debt payments, the head of the International Monetary Fund has urged before a global summit on climate finance. Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, said providing debt relief to countries suffering from extreme weather was a matter of urgency. Extreme weather is hitting harder around the world, and countries already facing debt mountains cannot afford to service their debts, particularly at a time of high interest rates. “Timely debt relief is essential,” she said. “Vulnerable countries hit by the impacts of climate change need urgent assistance to be able to address new pressing needs, while remaining able to to meet their obligations [on debt repayments]. This is a challenge we are rallying all key parties - including official and private sector creditors - to address as quickly as possible.” She called for more action, including “debt for climate swaps”, by which donors forgo some of their interest or repayments and the money is diverted to actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or improve countries’ resilience to climate shocks. She said that finance for poor countries to cope with the climate crisis was severely lacking. “We [as a world] are way behind in terms of reducing emissions, and way, way behind in mobilising finance for emerging markets and developing economies, where the growth in emissions is most significant,” she told the Guardian. On Thursday and Friday this week, Emmanuel Macron of France will host a summit of more than 50 world leaders in Paris to discuss a new global financial pact, covering climate and development. Under discussion will be the potential for reform of the World Bank and its fellow institutions, including the IMF, and ways of expanding the amount of climate finance available for developing countries from billions to trillions of dollars a year. Georgieva, who has held the top role at the IMF since 2019, after a spell as chief executive and acting president of the World Bank and as a European commissioner, will play a key role in the Paris conference. Under her leadership, the IMF hasincreased its involvement in climate finance. “Developing countries are very aware of the climate crisis. I don’t think I have met a head of state or senior minister from Africa who did not want to talk about the climate crisis. It was very different even five years ago, when the climate was perceived to be very much a rich countries’ agenda,” she said. “Now it is very much a developing country priority.” The IMF has also changed in response to these needs, she added, and was aiming for a 50% increase in its core climate finance next year. “The fund is in a very different place now.” Suggestions likely to be brought up at the talks include tripling the finance that can be provided by the World Bank and putting a global tax on shipping to raise money to help countries worst hit by climate loss and damages. But Georgieva also favours quicker wins that are less complex and politically fraught. For instance, providing more finance to poor countries in local currencies, rather than relying on dollars or other main world currencies, would substantially cut the cost of their borrowing, at a time of high interest rates. “Lots of finance is provided in foreign currency, but needs to be in local currency,” she said. The IMF forecasts inflation will not come under control until 2024 or 2025, meaning problems with high interest rates are likely to persist for some time. “So debt will be even higher,” she said. “Debt resolution is a huge and pressing issue for the poorest.” Bond contingent clauses are another area she hopes could bear fruit. “We have been working intensively to analyse such clauses that could be provided [in case of] high risk climate-related events,” she said. Countries meeting in Paris will also discuss ways to make climate finance more accessible to developing countries, removing the barriers that inhibit lending, especially to poorer countries considered high risk by conventional investors. Many civil society groups have called for finance to be provided in grants rather than repayable loans. However, Georgieva defended the use of loans: “As much as possible, climate finance in the form of grants of course helps. But long-term concessional finance also helps. Loans can create better prospects for sustainable growth, if the money is used to drive economic productivity.” She added: “Debt per se is not bad, it can create opportunities for a more productive economy. Debt is bad when the money is wasted, or provided at a non-sustainable level [such as at too high an interest rate]. The more you provide grants to low income countries the better, but the more we can provide highly concessional long-term loans the better, too.” She called on all development banks and other institutions, public and private, to step up their engagement on climate finance, which has become a big stumbling block to putting the world on track to meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “Every one of us have to do as much as we can, as fast as we can,” she said. • This article was amended on 21 June 2023 to clarify the way the IMF is responding to debt relief for vulnerable countries hit by climate disasters.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a921', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/what-it-felt-like-to-seal-historic-cop15-biodiversity-deal-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘I still can’t get over the fact we did it’: what it felt like to seal historic Cop15 deal', 'lead': 'The global agreement to protect nature was signed in Montreal in December.

They include goals to protect 30% of the planet for nature by 2030, reform $500bn (£395bn) of environmentally damaging subsidies, and restore 30% of the planet’s degraded terrestrial, inland water, coastal and marine ecosystems. During the once-a-decade summit in Montreal, it seemed as if the process might fall apart amid walkouts over money, geopolitical tensions and mistrust between the global north and south stemming from last November’s Cop27 climate talks in Egypt. In the end, participants reached an agreement in the early hours of 20 December. The Guardian has spoken with some of the key figures about how they felt when the deal was sealed and what needs to happen now. Steven Guilbeault, Canada’s environment minister “I suspect that Cop15 will be a high point in my professional and personal life,” says Guilbeault who, alongside the summit president, China’s environment minister, Huang Runqiu, helped to guide negotiations. “To be able to play the role I was playing in Montreal, working with the international community, working very closely with China – a country with whom we’ve had challenging diplomatic relations, to say the least – and to be able to do this on my home turf, was an incredible experience.” Virginijus Sinkevičius, EU environment commissioner “It was a true win for multilateralism, at a time when we need it the most, and a historic outcome for nature and people,” says Sinkevičius, who was the EU’s representative at the summit. “When I look back, I’m truly proud of what we have achieved in Montreal. We now have the targets and timetables we need to pull nature back from the brink, and to help keep the 1.5C goal alive. But we have to be brutally realistic. Success is not guaranteed by an international agreement.” Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde, head of the Brazilian delegation Just hours after the deal had formally passed, it came close to falling apart. Ève Bazaiba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s environment minister, threatened to throw the integrity of the agreement into doubt after China’s summit president appeared to ignore DRC’s objections to the text and forced it through. But the international debut of the negotiating coalition between Brazil, Indonesia and the DRC – the “Opec of rainforests” – helped to avert disaster hours later, with De Athayde helping coordinate a symbolic handshake between Bazaiba and Huang Runqiu. For many, this was the moment the agreement was truly struck. “There had been disappointment within the developing-country community about the outcome on money. Some were still reluctant to agree to the package. We were happy to be able to help,” says De Athayde, recalling the moment when the DRC dropped its opposition, to the applause of the negotiating hall. “[The handshake] felt very good. In the end, our delegation was both happy to have contributed to a deal and also very relieved that Cop was over.” Basile van Havre, co-chair of the negotiations The path to Cop15 was heavily disrupted by the pandemic. At points, it looked like it would never happen. The summit was meant to take place in October 2020 but was repeatedly pushed back and eventually moved to Montreal from Kunming due to China’s Covid rules. Van Havre, who co-chaired the process with Francis Ogwal, oversaw days of slow talks from 2020 to 2022 and tried to keep momentum in the process over Zoom calls, with some negotiators having to get up in the early hours to participate. “I still can’t get over the fact we did it,” he says. “My wife was reminding me that she came to see me for a few days in Montreal. One night, I was crawling into bed around 3.30am and she asked how it’s going. I said: ‘Not well.’ Which is very unusual for me. I really thought we were not going to get there. And in the end we did and it was an incredible, incredible accomplishment.” Li Shuo, Greenpeace policy expert Now, there is the difficult task of implementing the goals. Governments have never met a single target they have set for themselves on avoiding biodiversity loss. Changing that has to be the focus, according toLi. “The success of Cop15 is defined by what happens afterwards. It is not just what governments say that matters, but what they will do to implement the global biodiversity framework. Six months after the monumental nature summit in Montreal, much remains to be done to sustain the momentum.” David Cooper, acting UN biodiversity chief Cooper, who says Cop15 was an “all-consuming” experience, is hopeful that this decade will mark a change in how governments approach nature. “I don’t have to explain what the agreement means, even with the business community. There’s an interest by all of these constituencies to be part of it. “The biggest thing we need now is courageous governance. The actions that are needed will impact all sectors. Of course, we believe that they’ll benefit them all in the medium to longer term. But in the short term, there’s going to be cost and there’s going to be vested interest fighting back. So this will only succeed with leadership.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a922', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/beyond-montreal-six-months-after-deal-to-halt-biodiversity-loss-where-are-we', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Beyond Montreal: six months after deal to halt biodiversity loss, where are we?', 'lead': 'There have been gains and losses since the Cop15 agreement was signed in December, with key moments still to come ahead of the next biodiversity Cop in Turkey in 2024', 'author': 'Patrick Greenfield and Phoebe Weston', 'datePublished': '2023-06-20 10:00:31', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560714', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/1eafd5f07fe5199c64aceafa49480bf895e226be/0_0_5327_3196/500.jpg', 'body': 'In the six months since the Cop15 summit, some significant environmental agreements have forced nature up the international agenda, but there have also been setbacks to achieving the aims of the ‘historic’ deal to halt the loss of biodiversity agreed in Canada last December. An informal check-in is expected between environment ministers at the climate Cop28 in Dubai later this year before the next biodiversity Cop in Turkey in 2024. The good news: oceans, plastic and migratory species In March, governments reached a deal to protect the high seas after nearly two decades. The agreement is crucial for the flagship Cop15 target of protecting 30% of land and sea as it paves the way for the creation of more marine protected areas. Earlier this month, countries moved forward on creating a legally binding treaty to regulate plastic waste, with pollution one of the five main drivers of biodiversity loss. In October, an international summit on protecting migratory species such as elephants, grey whales and swallows will be held in Uzbekistan. Brazil: the Amazon, Cerrado and Indigenous rights The return of the Lula government has already had early success at reducing deforestation in the world’s largest rainforest, with the Brazilian president moving to expand protections to other biomes, such as the Cerrado. His government is pushing to host a pan-Amazon summit in August as part of an effort to permanently halt the destruction of the ecosystem, which is critical to climate and biodiversity targets. But plans to better protect Indigenous rights – a key principle of the Cop15 agreement – have been trampled on in Brazil by members of the country’s conservative-dominated lower house, who approved controversial legislation that would damage human communities and the environment if the senate approves it. National strategy plans Before next year’s Cop16 summit in Turkey, countries are required to release their national biodiversity strategies and action plans – which show how a country is helping meet the overall agreement. Japan, Rwanda and Canada have all taken steps to release strategies, and Spain will updates its plan in late January. EU nature restoration In Europe, efforts to introduce legally binding targets on nature restoration have become embroiled in political controversy, with the European parliament’s largest group – the centre-right European People’s party (EPP) – refusing to back the proposals. It is currently hanging by a thread. If the law does not pass, it would be a major blow to meeting the targets agreed at Cop15. Funding biodiversity Divisions over money were the most complicated issue at Cop15, threatening to derail the agreement even after it had formally passed, with Democratic Republic of the Congo and many other developing countries wanting to see the creation of a standalone fund for biodiversity. Instead, a fund-within-a-fund was the compromise solution, alongside $30bn for biodiversity by 2030 with $20bn needed by 2025. This month, the UN’s main biodiversity fund – the Global Environment Facility – will meet in Brazil to approve its creation. It is expected to launch in August at the GEF’s assembly in Vancouver. After that, the focus will be on the scale of contributions from donors. Debt-for-nature swaps As part of efforts to increase funding for biodiversity, a growing number of developing countries have entered into “debt-for-nature swaps”. Ecuador recently agreed the largest ever deal – a debt purchase that will generate lifetime savings of $1.1bn – to help fund conservation in the Galápagos Islands. Belize and Barbados already have them, and more are expected. Creative financial deals for biodiversity will be on the agenda at a global finance summit in Paris on 22-23 June, jointly hosted by the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Corporate responsibility For companies, which are required to identify and disclose which parts of their operations affect and depend on nature, progress has been made on the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures. Co-hosted by Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, who was the UN biodiversity chief at Cop15, it will publish its recommendations in September. The Science-Based Targets Network has also released initial guidance for companies measuring how they contribute to land degradation, and the use and pollution of freshwater. The role of banks Central banks have also been discussing the risk of biodiversity loss. This month, research by the European Central Bank found that the EU’s economy was highly dependent on nature, and its collapse could cause instability. Similar assessments have been carried out in Malaysia and Singapore, according to the Financial Times, but the US central bank has stayed away from the subject. Action on species loss Researchers continue to raise the alarm about species decline. A paper published by the Royal Society in April found that without ambitious action, targets to stop wildlife declines by 2030 (as agreed at Cop15) could be slipping out of reach. This research was based on the principle of ecological lag, which is the time delay between the environmental change (such as a change in temperature or land use) and the time it takes for wildlife to respond to it. The study warns that up to 2050, wildlife populations will still be responding to environmental change that happened before 2010. “Even radical land restoration efforts may therefore fail to end population declines by 2030,” say the authors.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a923', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/nature-at-risk-of-breakdown-if-cop15-pledges-not-met-world-leaders-warned', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Nature at risk of breakdown if Cop15 pledges not met, world leaders warned', 'lead': 'Author of landmark UK review into the economic value of nature joins UN environment chief in calls for ‘action, not just words’ on biodiversity goals', 'author': 'Patrick Greenfield', 'datePublished': '2023-06-20 05:00:33', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560734', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/045c97fc9b16b3dac742bf38b34270e0e7edc502/0_67_3460_2076/500.jpg', 'body': 'Humans are exploiting nature beyond its limits, the University of Cambridge economist Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta has warned, as the UN’s environment chief calls on governments to make good on a global deal for biodiversity, six months after it was agreed. Dasgupta, the author of a landmark review into the economic importance of nature commissioned by the UK Treasury in 2021, said it was a mistake to continue basing economic policies on the postwar boom that did not account for damage to the planet. Speaking to the Guardian six months after Cop15, where countries agreed this decade’s targets to protect nature, Dasgupta cautioned that a headline goal to protect 30% of land and sea should not lead to the destruction of the remaining 70%. He reiterated a recommendation from his 2021 report that companies must disclose the parts of their supply chain that rely on nature, so governments can take action on halting biodiversity loss. Since the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework was agreed in December 2022, there has been a deal to protect the high seas and first steps towards a legally binding UN treaty to regulate plastic waste. The first few months of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s presidency in Brazil has seen reductions in deforestation in the Amazon, although nature has become a culture wars issue in the EU, with proposals on restoration and pesticide reduction facing fierce opposition. An informal update on progress towards reaching the 23 targets and four goals included in the Montreal agreement is expected to be made at Cop28 in Dubai amid continuing scientific warnings about the health of the planet. “It is a truism: if the demand for nature’s products and services continues to exceed its ability to supply, then there is going to be a breakdown,” said Dasgupta. “It is a finite resource. We know when fisheries are depleted by continuous overfishing, it leads to the destruction of a fishery. Now try to imagine that at the scale of the biosphere. “This excess demand [for nature] is only about 50 years old. There’s been a great acceleration in that demand since the second world war. This experience is guiding policy and it’s a real mistake because it has come at a big expense to natural capital. The decline has not been recorded in statistics. It doesn’t show up in national accounts,” he added. “As an economist, I like to look at small societies as a prototype of the world economy. Studying poorer village economies tells you a lot: they are deeply dependent on natural capital. Many such societies have fallen under. We’ve seen this in Sudan with rainless areas, skinny cattle and people migrating miles and miles. It is not as if we don’t know what happens when nature breaks down.” Among the targets and goals agreed in Montreal by all governments, except the Vatican and the US, were aims to protect 30% of the planet for nature by the end of the decade, reform $500bn (£410bn) of environmentally damaging subsidies and restore 30% of the planet’s degraded terrestrial, inland water, coastal and marine ecosystems. Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN environment programme, said now was the time for action from governments and businesses to make the agreement reality. “We should be very proud of what was achieved. It is words on a piece of paper. We need to make them real. Everyone needs to adjust their targets and move this beyond the environment ministry to all sectors. It needs the whole of society. Action now has to be seen, not just in words,” she said. Dasgupta’s 2021 report, inspired by the 2006 Nicholas Stern review that transformed economic understanding of climate breakdown, found the world’s economies are being put at “extreme risk” by the failure to account for the state of the natural world, and called for radical reform. “I know there is a target to protect 30% of the planet in the [Cop15] deal. But the trouble with that is what happens to the other 70%. If you don’t have a policy for protecting the other 70%, you’re going to have huge pressure on it. It’s an interrelated biosphere. The 30% and the 70% are not disconnected. There are no big barriers – there’s not a Donald Trump wall between them,” he said. As part of the Cop15 agreement, large companies around the world are required to disclose the parts of their supply chains that rely on nature and take actions to mitigate any destruction, echoing a key recommendation of the Dasgupta report. “As citizens, we all want actions: what should the government do? What should the citizen do? What should the company do? What laws should be passed? We should insist on company disclosure of what’s happening in their supply chain. By doing so, you are sending a signal to your investors. And if they care about the fact that you’re trashing the rainforest in Brazil, they’ll punish you for it. But if they never know that you’re doing it, they won’t,” he said.

Normally a bioblitz involves identifying as many life forms as possible in one place over one day. Since the owners of this 30-acre former farm have an inventory of 1,100 fellow residents already, our goal was more modest: 10 new species for their list. Some additions were admittedly less than exciting. Traps set the night before yielded several of a moth family called “the pugs”: 50 tiny elongated flakes of greyness with lines of minute dark-grey dots. They have names like grey pug, plain pug, shaded and mottled pug, but ours was perhaps the masterpiece in anonymity – common pug. Yet it was new and thus equal in bioblitz status to more noteworthy finds, including a speckled bush cricket. This extraterrestrial beast possesses an inner-body glow of fluorescent lime and manoeuvres on six stilt-like legs twice the length of the ink-freckled abdomen. Equally, an arachnid named the “cucumber spider” needs little further gloss to convey its own thrilling colours. As in all natural history work, it wasn’t what we set out to achieve that moved me most, but a realisation that crept up sideways as we went about the task. Cosford has been in a countryside stewardship scheme for three decades, and it’s astonishing how far it has journeyed towards its present wild conditions. Where once were arable crops propped up with fertilisers and pesticides are now 10,000 globes of golden yellow spread over the rolling terrain by a flower called creeping cinquefoil. Among this was a busy weave of five bumblebee species. In one 5 metre by 5 metre plot, we counted 112 bee orchids and as many pyramidal orchids. All this is in a habitat that attracts the least subsidy support, yet yields to this country possibly more biodiversity than any other – scrub. That indefinable mix of young tree and thorn bush within a scrappy mosaic of flower-rich turf. Scrub needs a rebrand more urgently than the bioblitz, but bring the two together and you have something like an English version of wildlife heaven. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a925', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/mysterious-pile-of-dumped-ppe-angers-people-in-calmore-new-forest-hampshire', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Mysterious pile of ‘dumped’ PPE angers people in New Forest', 'lead': 'Inquiry launched by Environment Agency into huge pile of medical aprons found in Calmore, Hampshire', 'author': 'Emine Sinmaz', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 19:00:37', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560786', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/15539605c634edd5b26265c9a176714b3f2e5f30/0_174_5264_3158/500.jpg', 'body': 'The “dumping” of hundreds of thousands of pieces of unused personal protective equipment near a nature reserve on the edge of the New Forest has mystified and angered local people. But the council has revealed the giant pile of boxes containing medical aprons in Calmore, Hampshire, will be recycled into plastic bags. Councillors said they reacted with horror after the discovery was made public at a Hampshire county council (HCC) meeting last week. It is not yet known if the items are linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, but the council has asked the Environment Agency to investigate. The large-scale discovery in Calmore, near Testwood Lakes Nature Reserve, came after an investigation by New Forest District Council (NFDC) into use of land at Little Testwood Farm Caravan Park. A report from HCC’s regulatory committee said: “It became apparent that thousands of packs of medical aprons had been dumped on the land with no obvious signs that they were being protected or stored for some future use. The concern is that they have been dumped with no intention of removal to a proper facility. “The Environment Agency have been contacted to see if they can determine where the PPE originated and whether it was discarded by a health trust as substandard during the Covid procurement.” Councillor Peter Latham, the committee chair, said: “It was a surprise, to put it mildly – a reaction of horror – that something like that could have happened in Hampshire and nobody knew about it.” Councillor Neville Penman said: “I’m totally amazed at how much has been dumped. I just can’t believe it because somebody must have seen it being put there, but I’ve never seen so much waste in all my life … To be honest with you, I’m distraught over it.” A report last year revealed that protective clothing worth £4bn bought early in the pandemic was set to be burned because it was substandard. The Commons public accounts committee’s report said the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had so much unneeded PPE that it had appointed two commercial waste firms to help it dispose of 15,000 pallets a month “via a combination of recycling and burning to generate power”. On Monday, thousands of boxes – some labelled “apron” and “made in China” – containing more than 100 units apiece remained piled on pallets near the caravan park. People living near the site said they did not see the pallets being unloaded and did not know how long they had been there for. But one man who lives in the caravan park said he was shocked by the amount of waste. The man, who did not want to be named, said: “It’s just a load of crap dumped there. Taxpayers’ money just dumped there. I’m shocked.” A nurse who lives nearby added: “I am surprised because I work as a nurse and I know during the pandemic how we didn’t have enough PPE and how difficult it was to find it. It’s shocking to find out some has been dumped here.” A NFDC spokesperson said the discovery was made after an inspection at the caravan park on 4 April. “This inspection revealed that a large quantity of PPE was being stored on the land in contravention of the caravan site licence conditions. The council, in its licensing capacity, has requested that the stored items be removed from the land,” they added. “Subsequent inspections have been carried out by Hampshire county council and The Environment Agency. All the material is packaged and palletized and is due to be removed from the site for processing and recycling into plastic bags over the coming weeks. The Environment Agency will continue to carry out further enquires as to source of the material and how it came to be present on the land.” An inspector from The Environment Agency was seen taking samples of the equipment on Monday. A spokesperson added: “While any investigation is ongoing, we are unable to comment further in order to not prejudice any investigations or subsequent enforcement decisions.” HCC confirmed it was working with the agency to investigate.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a926', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/quite-weird-sea-temperature-rise-in-north-east-of-england-worrying-for-residents', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Quite weird’: sea temperature rise in north-east of England worries residents ', 'lead': 'Mixed reactions greet dramatic fluctuation in sea temperatures in Tynemouth', 'author': 'Mark Brown North of England correspondent', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 17:15:23', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560806', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/851f0c38ebf4690e4fef4424ca30ad3903024a01/0_153_4582_2750/500.jpg', 'body': '“I’ve never felt the sea this warm in June, it is quite weird,” said retired nurse Val Hedley as she finished her regular paddle along the picture-postcard golden sands of Longsands beach in Tynemouth. “Often here you will get a cold bit of the sea, then it gets warmer and then it gets cooler again. But today everything seems to be the same which is unusual … it’s all evenly warm. “It is worrying but then other strange things are happening like seaweed accumulating in places it doesn’t normally accumulate. I don’t know what’s going on … it must be climate change, mustn’t it?” Hedley, who lives in Wylam, Northumberland, was speaking on the day scientists revealed an “unheard of” marine heatwave which has pushed up sea temperatures in the North Sea and north Atlantic. The temperature rise for the north-east of England is particularly striking and it was concerning for swimmers and surfers out on the beach on Monday lunchtime. But most admitted they have yet to fully notice it. “It has felt as cold as normal, if I’m honest,” said 23-year-old Nathan Henderson, an instructor at Tynemouth surf company who has been surfing off the coast of north-east England since he was nine. “The sea here does gradually get warmer from April and the hottest month of the year, in the water, is September. That’s just how it works round here. I’ve not felt the sea getting warmer recently but it’s a worry if it is.” Most people braving the Tynemouth sea on Monday did not dip in above their knees. There was a lot of running in boldly and running out frantically. One fearless soul was Henry Harvey, a 19-year-old footballer for Blyth Town, who was in the sea with two friends. “It was really cold”, he said. “But it’s always cold. It’s never warm … you jump headfirst in and it’s a shock, but it’s good for you.” Barry Henderson has owned Longsands surf school for 12 years and is in the sea practically every day. “We surf all year and it’s always the same. In winter you surf with boots, gloves and a hood on and as you come into the warmer weather you want to take your boots and gloves off as quick as you can because it’s nicer to surf. “Maybe this year a couple of the younger lads probably had their gloves off quite early but it still has felt bloody freezing. It hasn’t felt massively different. “Some days I’ve gone in and thought the sea’s warming up. I’ve never gone in and thought, ‘it’s warm’.” That’s not to say he hasn’t noticed dramatic, apparently unexplainable, changes in temperature over the years. One August the temperature felt as high as 16 degrees, he said, and then suddenly it wasn’t. “It never came back up to that temperature … it’s strange how it can change like that.” His surf school overlooks the abandoned wreck of Tynemouth outdoor pool, a place which was notoriously freezing in its heyday because it was filled up with sea water. Henderson has memories of badgering his mother to go in the pool when he was six. “I think it was two pence and I dived straight in and it was just so cold, my breath just completely left me. It was so, so cold.” For many years there has been a campaign to bring back Tynemouth outdoor pool, which opened in the 1920s and closed with the rise of package holidays in the 1970s. There is much goodwill behind the campaign with support for many predicated on one central part of the proposal: it will be heated.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a927', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/is-that-you-migaloo-tourist-captures-video-of-familiar-looking-whale-over-great-barrier-reef', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Is that you, Migaloo?

A tourist flying over the Great Barrier Reef filmed what appeared to be a white humpback whale swimming north, as thousands of humpbacks make their annual migration from Antartica to warmer waters to breed. But scientists cautioned it might not be Migaloo. “It’s clear from the footage it’s unmistakably a white whale but there is always an element of doubt, which is why we can’t confirm until we’re 100%,” said Vanessa Pirotta, a whale expert at Macquarie University. “If it is him it would be incredible that this one iconic whale has avoided being seen for so long along one of the busiest coastlines in the world.” Migaloo, the only known albino humpback whale in Australia’s east coast population, was first spotted in 1991 at Byron Bay when he was estimated to be around two years old. He has been spotted occasionally in intervening years since, with the last sighting in 2020 off the coast of Port Macquarie. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In 2004, tissue samples collected from Migaloo, which is a First Nations word for “white fella”, confirmed its lack of pigmentation was due to albinism. Pirotta said other whales in the population that are predominately white or are swimming on their backs with their white belly pointed to the sun can sometimes be mistaken for Migaloo by observers. “It’s one of the beautiful things about this population that have such variation in the way that they look,” she said. “Migaloo looks like an iceberg under the water.” Dr Wally Franklin, director of the Oceania Project, said Migaloo has two telltale bumps on his back where his backbone protrudes and unique serrations on the outer side of his tail fluke. “Last time we sighted him in Hervey Bay was in 1998 when he was around nine years old. He was singing and we recorded his song,” Franklyn said. “He’s quite a superb singer.” Frankyln said there was a low probability that Migaloo would pass his albinism on to his offspring given both he and the female would need to carry the gene. Pirotta encouraged anyone else who thinks they spot Migaloo to send the information to the White Whale Research Centre. “The sighting is truly a great example of citizen science and people capturing information helps us learn more about one of the most famous whales in the world,” she said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a928', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/australians-far-less-aware-of-biodiversity-loss-than-climate-crisis-research-finds', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Australians far less aware of biodiversity loss than climate crisis, research finds', 'lead': 'However, a majority of Australians think more money should be spent on the environment', 'author': 'Lisa Cox', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 15:00:15', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560869', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/cda14f773a1cbac9797abd59e3b1aeaba88aae4b/0_149_4471_2683/500.jpg', 'body': 'Half of Australians are unaware of the extent of the nature crisis despite agreeing governments need to do more to support the environment, research by the Biodiversity Council suggests. Graeme Samuel, the former competition watchdog head who chaired a 2020 review of Australia’s environmental laws, says a campaign is needed to bring public awareness of biodiversity decline in line with the understanding of the climate crisis. The Biodiversity Council, which is a partnership between 11 Australian universities, surveyed people about their attitudes to nature. The online poll of about 4,050 people found although most (63%) understood how unique Australia’s wildlife was and 83% rated looking after nature as important to them, many were not aware of the extent of biodiversity loss in Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The research found that fewer than half (43%) were aware Australia had one of the highest rates of mammal extinction in the world and just more than half (54%) knew most of Australia’s forests had been lost since colonisation. Awareness of climate change and how it affected nature was much higher, with 74% indicating they understood global heating was having a direct impact on wildlife and ecosystems. Winnifred Louis, professor of psychology at the University of Queensland and one of the report’s authors, said there were many psychological biases that could lead to a gulf between the state of the environment and how people perceived it. Louis said when changes in the environment were gradual it could be difficult for people to notice. “People’s opinions can be influenced by a few key species, so if they see whales they feel the oceans must be doing OK, even if many other species are missing and if whales are in much smaller numbers than in past decades,” she said. “Without specialist training, people may not recognise the difference between environments that are green and full of diverse native plants, and environments that are green and full of weed species.” Louis said much reporting and discussion on the state of nature was focused on “big ticket” species, such as bilbies or koalas, rather than things people could relate to in their local area. Samuel’s 2020 review of national laws found Australia’s environment was in unsustainable decline and successive Australian governments had failed to protect the country’s unique species and habitats. He said the public’s understanding of the nature crisis was years behind the level of awareness of the climate crisis. He called for a shift in focus from individual charismatic species – such as the koala – to flora and fauna generally and what they mean for people. “I think we need a major awareness campaign to bring people up to the same level of awareness and sensitivity to biodiversity as they have for climate change,” he said. “We’ve got a lot to do to raise awareness. It is so important.” The Biodiversity Council’s survey found the majority of respondents were concerned for Australia’s biodiversity, with at least two-thirds very or extremely concerned about waste and pollution, land-clearing, extinction of species and the loss of pollinator species and natural places. About three-quarters (72%) said more money should be spent on the environment. Scientists have estimated about $2bn is needed annually to recover Australia’s full list of almost 2,000 threatened plants, animals and ecological communities. Brendan Wintle, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Melbourne and lead councillor at the Biodiversity Council, said about half of Australia’s economy relied on natural systems. He said the loss of biodiversity would have serious consequences for clean air, food and water, human health, Indigenous culture and national identity. “Many people would be shocked if they realised the actual state of Australia’s biodiversity,” Wintle said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a929', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/wealth-tax-help-poorer-countries-tackle-climate-crisis-economists', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'A wealth tax could help poorer countries tackle climate crisis, economists say', 'lead': 'Taxing world’s wealthiest people could help poorer countries shift economies to low-carbon and recover from climate damage', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey in Edinburgh', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 10:40:45', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560888', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0d3cbddc74942aed16f5a5d2c657172a34fa1dd0/0_267_4003_2402/500.jpg', 'body': 'Tax extreme wealth to pay for the climate-related damage to the poorest, a group of more than 100 leading economists have urged. A wealth tax on the fortunes of the world’s richest people would raise trillions of dollars that could be spent on helping poorer countries shift their economies to a low-carbon footing, and on “loss and damage”, the rescue and rehabilitation of countries stricken by climate disaster. A 2% tax on extreme wealth would yield about $2.5tn a year, by recent estimates. The economists, including the prominent degrowth advocate Jason Hickel, have written a letter to world leaders before a global summit on finance this week. They are calling for a tax of 1.5% for 1.5C to help ensure the world limits global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The world’s wealthiest people are responsible for an outsize proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, with the richest 1% responsible for double the carbon emissions of the world’s poorest half, according to Oxfam, but there are few constraints on them. Recent research suggests if the combined emissions of wealthy countries was counted against the destruction that the climate crisis is wreaking in poorer countries, the rich would owe the poor $6tn a year in “reparations” for the damage caused. Mark Paul, of Rutgers University, and a signatory of the letter, which was spearheaded by the campaigning group Oil Change International, said rich countries were not facing up to their responsibilities. “Global north leaders saying they can’t afford to address global crises is the oldest excuse in the book, and simply put, a lie. What’s truly unaffordable is the status quo. The truth is there is no shortage of public money that can be dedicated to the cause, only a lack of political will – but that must change.” In the letter, the economists also call for an end to harmful subsidies of fossil fuels, and the forgiveness of debts for some of the poorest countries. Alex Lenferna, of Nelson Mandela University and the Climate Justice Coalition, one of the signatories of the letter, said: “Countries in the global south are drowning in debt, which is driving austerity and undermining our ability to respond to the climate crisis. “We need much more public money to drive a truly just transition. The global north must pay their climate debt, and not use climate finance as a wolf in sheep’s clothing that advances their interests.” Richard Heede, of the Climate Accountability Institute, said fossil fuel companies must pay for the damage they have caused. “The wealthy fossil fuel companies that have acted in concert to delay action and perpetuate the carbon economy should also contribute substantially to an atmospheric trust to aid the nations and peoples who have contributed little to the climate emergency.” About 50 heads of state and government are expected to attend the summit for a new global financing pact, which will be held in Paris on Thursday and Friday, hosted by the French president Emmanuel Macron, with Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados. It is intended to address the deep concerns that developing countries have over the continuing lack of the financial assistance that has long been promised to them by richer countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. Leaders including Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, and the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, are expected to attend. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, is unlikely to attend the meeting, however. Climate finance is an increasingly contentious issue for poorer countries, which are aggrieved that the richer countries are helping Ukraine, and found trillions to cope with Covid, but are unwilling to help them with the impacts of the climate crisis. In November governments agreed to set up a fund for “loss and damage”, to help reconstruct communities afflicted by climate disaster. But there is no agreement yet on how to raise the money needed to fill it. Poorer countries also find it hard to access money for green development of their economies, despite being urged by richer countries to cut their emissions. Mottley has set out her proposals for reform of the World Bank and its fellow international institutions to triple the money they can make available to developing countries. The conference will also discuss potential new sources of revenue such as taxes on high-carbon activities, including global shipping. Avinash Persaud, an economic adviser to Mottley, told the Guardian: “We need a complete rethink of the whole nexus of climate, debt and development. What we are seeing today is new – countries affected by climate disaster, this is happening now. Countries are drowning.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a92b', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/marine-heatwave-uk-irish-coasts-threat-oysters-fish-high-temperatures', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Unheard of’ marine heatwave off UK and Irish coasts poses serious threat', 'lead': 'Sustained high temperatures over summer could trigger mass mortality of fish and oysters, say scientists', 'author': 'Helena Horton Environment reporter', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 10:21:19', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560928', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/028c85b76a8fe4038312543e706cf386e9633092/0_0_6154_3691/500.jpg', 'body': 'An “unheard of” marine heatwave off the coasts of the UK and Ireland poses a serious threat to species, scientists have warned. Sea temperatures, particularly off the north-east coast of England and the west of Ireland, are several degrees above normal, smashing records for late spring and early summer. The North Sea and north Atlantic are experiencing higher temperatures, data shows. The Met Office said global sea surface temperatures in April and May reached an all-time high for those months, according to records dating to 1850, with June also on course to hit record heat levels. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has categorised parts of the North Sea as being in a category four marine heatwave, which is considered “extreme”, with areas off the coast of England up to 5C above what is usual. The Met Office says temperatures are likely to remain high because of the emerging El Niño weather phenomenon. Daniela Schmidt, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Bristol, said: “The extreme and unprecedented temperatures show the power of the combination of human-induced warming and natural climate variability like El Niño. “While marine heatwaves are found in warmer seas like the Mediterranean, such anomalous temperatures in this part of the north Atlantic are unheard of. They have been linked to less dust from the Sahara but also the North Atlantic climate variability, which will need further understanding to unravel. “Heat, like on land, stresses marine organisms. In other parts of the world, we have seen several mass mortalities of marine plants and animals caused by ocean heatwave which have caused hundreds of millions of pounds of losses, in fisheries income, carbon storage, cultural values and habitat loss. As long as we are not dramatically cutting emissions, these heatwaves will continue to destroy our ecosystems. But as this is happening below the surface of the ocean, it will go unnoticed.” Dr Dan Smale from the Marine Biological Association has been working on marine heatwaves for more than a decade and was surprised by the temperatures. He said: “I always thought they would never be ecologically impactful in the cool waters around UK and Ireland but this is unprecedented and possibly devastating. Current temperatures are way too high but not yet lethal for majority of species, although stressful for many … If it carries on through summer we could see mass mortality of kelp, seagrass, fish and oysters.” Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics at the University of Leeds, said: “Both Met Office and NOAA analyses of sea-surface temperature show temperatures are at their highest ever level – and the average sea-surface temperature breached 21C for the first time in April. These high temperatures are mainly driven by unprecedented high rates of human-induced warming. “Cleaning up sulphur from marine shipping fuels is probably adding to the greenhouse gas driven warming. The shift towards El Niño conditions is also adding to the heat. There is also evidence that there is less Saharan dust over the ocean this year. This normally reflects heat away from the ocean. So in all, oceans are being hit by a quadruple whammy – it’s a sign of things to come.” Marine heatwaves are becoming more numerous, a 2019 study found, with the number of heatwave days having tripled in the past couple of years studied. The number of heatwave days rose by more than 50% in the 30 years to 2016, compared with 1925-54. Scientists said at the time the heat destroyed swathes of sealife “like wildfires take out huge areas of forest”. The damage caused in these hotspots is also harmful to humanity, which relies on the oceans for oxygen, food, storm protection and the removal of climate-heating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A report by the Met Office says warmer than usual marine temperatures are contributing to a reduction in sea ice. It found the amount of Arctic ice was well below average for the time of year but still above record low levels after near-average ice loss during May. However, Antarctic sea ice extent is exceptionally low, the lowest on record for this date by a wide margin. Dr Ed Blockley, the lead of the polar climate group at the Met Office, said: “Over recent decades we have seen a sustained loss in Arctic sea ice extent in every month of the year – especially in late summer to early autumn. Although the current Arctic sea ice extent is considerably higher than the record low for the time of year, it is still well below the long-term average. “Antarctic sea ice has been at very low levels since November 2016. This year we have seen Antarctic sea ice shrink to a record low point for the time of year, following a second successive annual record minimum sea ice extent in February.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a92c', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/christian-cooper-central-park-birdwatcher-racism', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘She doesn’t have the power’: Central Park birdwatcher Christian Cooper on why racist ‘incident’ won’t define him', 'lead': 'A white woman made a threat against Cooper in 2020, and the world took notice.

I see Christian Cooper sitting with perfect posture on a bench right at the entrance of Central Park at West 103rd street. His first question for me is: have I brought any binoculars? I don’t own a pair, I admit. No worries, he says. If we spot anything, he’ll lend me his. That’s the most important birding tip I learned from his new book: you spot movement in the sky, with your naked eye first, then you raise your binoculars, not the other way around. Cooper is joyous when he tells me this. “If the book does nothing else but teach people how to use binoculars so they can actually see the birds, mission accomplished,” he says. The book, Better Living Through Birding, is Cooper’s first memoir. It traces his journey from his childhood as a nerdy kid from Long Island, to his time as a comic book editor, to his birding days in Central Park. While doing so it weaves the history of Black people in America – from slavery and lynchings to segregation and economic disparity – into the unfolding of his life. It also covers the moment, three years ago, when Cooper received international attention when, while birdwatching in Central Park, he asked a woman to leash her dog, in compliance with park rules, because he didn’t want it to disturb or maim any nearby birds. The woman, Amy Cooper (a stranger to Christian, their shared surname a coincidence), who is white, became irate and said that she would call the cops and tell them that an African American man was threatening her life. Christian Cooper was doing no such thing, but he did film the entire exchange. He posted the video to his Facebook friends with the context of what happened. His sister Melody asked if she could share it on Twitter. Cooper hesitated but ultimately obliged. Kathy Griffin retweeted it and the rest, as they say, is history. The 69-second video got more than 45m views. Cooper now references this whole ordeal as “the incident”. In that instant, a white woman made a false accusation that could have led to his death. She knew the stakes, which is why she feigned hysteria on the phone with the cops. Christian Cooper knew the stakes, too. But though Amy Cooper swiftly lost her job after the video went viral, Christian Cooper did not want any part of the prosecutorial process, a decision that put him at odds with some Black people, including his relatives. He tells me: “There were a lot of factors involved. It was potentially very important to set a precedent where someone was held accountable, legally, for making a false accusation against a Black person.” He stresses that it was a tough call not to get involved, but unless the district attorney were to subpoena him, he was going to choose mercy. Not everyone was a fan of his choice. One of his relatives revealed the reason for their ire: “They had a brother who was in an affair with a white woman and when she got found out, she said it was rape. That person spent years in a jail in the south for that reason. So false accusations have haunted us for a long time,” Cooper says. I admit to him that, at the time, I was one of those people who was shocked that he didn’t want to be contributing more to her downfall. Punishment along with further punishment is part of what structures – and upholds – our society; we live in a punitive culture and the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world. It would be normal for Cooper to want retribution, but he doesn’t see it that way. “We [African-Americans] are fighting to have some sense of proportionality in how we are treated in the criminal justice system. So how can I turn that around and not consider the same thing?” he says. Cooper thought that the woman had already received enough punishment without further piling on necessary. “Her life had imploded. It’s not like I had been handcuffed or thrown to the ground or God forbid anything more deadly or serious,” he says. “If you could look at what happened to her and not conclude that you shouldn’t make false accusations, then how is any legal proceeding going to change your mind?” Furthermore, he says, he is not traumatized. People will approach him and say how sorry they are about his trauma. “What trauma?” Cooper says. “She just does not have that much power. Maybe it’s a consequence of being Black our whole lives.” In this country, Blackness is inextricably linked to suffering. A racist incident can often be the summary, rather than a chapter, of how our entire lives are esteemed, and this is what Cooper resists. We approach a spot where, about five or six years ago, Cooper spotted a Lincoln’s sparrow; he calls these “the fine wines of birding” because they are so hard to find. “It’s like someone took pen and watercolor and drew a sparrow because it’s so finely marked,” he says. This is what Cooper thinks about when he enters the park. He was neither traumatized nor shellshocked after “the incident”. He tells me: “When I go back to the park and I am at that spot where that mess happened, I’m not thinking about that. I’m remembering that time when there was a mourning warbler on that chip path 15 years ago and I remember the scarlet tanagers last week. That’s what I think about when I’m in the park.” Today, for example, he’s more excited about whether or not we’ll get to see an Acadian or great crested flycatcher. He’s concerned we might not get lucky because spring migration has already passed and fall migration is still months away. This is a man who routinely wakes up at 4am and ventures into Central Park at 5.30. He lets me know early on that his life and passions are more than “the incident”. As we start walking we spot a red-winged blackbird. It’s a very significant bird in Cooper’s life, he calls it his “spark bird”, a term used to describe the type of bird that first converts a person to birdwatching. Cooper references the bird at the beginning of the book and it sets the tone for a multilayered and intricate exploration of his own identity. In his book, Cooper describes the red-winged blackbird as a trickster of sorts. In the Americas, it’s part of a family of birds called icterids. When English settlers came to the western hemisphere, they thought it to be the same as the birds they saw in the UK, thus giving it the same name. But the joke was on them because the Eurasian blackbird is not an icterid, it’s part of the genus thrush. To add even more complexity, the UK already has a bird called the redwing, which belongs to the thrush family as well. Are you confused yet? Cooper writes in his book that these complicated taxonomies, through which humans label birds, first resonated with him when he was young, as a Black, queer, closeted kid growing up in a conservative Long Island community in the 60s and 70s. Though Cooper knew he was queer from the moment that his five-year-old self saw a male superhero in a comic book, he wasn’t open about his sexuality until he began studying at Harvard, where he took part in the ornithological club and the gay students association. His love of comics landed him a job as an assistant editor at Marvel in the early 90s. When he talks about this period of his life, I’m astonished by how certain he was in his identity at that time. He tells me that one day Paul Becton, a Black colorist for Marvel, walked into his office and saw a picture of the former Yankees player Steve Sax on the wall. “He was like, ‘Yes! Are you a Yankees fan?’ I’m like, ‘No.’ He’s like, ‘Are you just some homosexual with a thing for Steve Sax?’ ‘Yes,’” Cooper says. Cooper was only in his late 20s then, at a time when the world of comic book publishing was even more blindingly white than it is today. But he never tried to hide who he was: “I didn’t give them a choice. I’m queer. I’m OK with it. You can either be OK with it or not. That’s on you.” Cooper’s love of nature initially came from his father, Francis, a Korean war veteran, science teacher and civil rights activist. Francis took Cooper on trips to Yellowstone, Maine, the prairie provinces of Canada and the Olympic peninsula, trips that Cooper found it hard to return to in his writing. “At one point, my editors had to wait a whole month before they got any more pages out of me because I came to the part in telling the story of my family where everybody starts to die. I was like, ‘I cannot write this.’ I didn’t know how to deal with this. I’m not a very confessional person. And I’m not a very emotional person.” In his memoir, he writes that his father was a man who often projected his anger and frustrations on to his family, which made Cooper, his mother and his sister feel as though they were walking on eggshells around him for many years. The binoculars that hang around Cooper’s neck are the pair his father gifted to him on his 50th birthday. Even if it might have been hard for Cooper to write about and memorialize his father, his father was with us on our walk. Activism is also in Cooper’s blood. There is a photo of him as an infant in a stroller during a protest. Whether it was fighting school segregation or spearheading a Long Island chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, Cooper’s parents phoned, marched, organized and did whatever else they could to get into “good trouble”, a phrase most popularly attributed to John Lewis and his activism efforts. Cooper was arrested twice in 1999 within a matter of weeks while he was protesting for justice over the murder of Amadou Diallo. After a gay couple was bashed in upper Manhattan, he along with his allies at Glaad, the LGBTQ advocacy organization, organized an anti-violence rally. Black people and birds are connected particularly because of our shared history with migration, Cooper says: “Birds and African American history – they weave together in surprising ways. My family left Alabama because there was all this opportunity – the great migration. That’s exactly why birds migrate. Birds leave the south to come to the north because of opportunities seasonally.” He gets enthusiastic when I mention that even before this turning point in US history, Harriet Tubman learned bird calls in order to signal to other freedom seekers when it was safe or unsafe to proceed. He loves this part of her story. The silver lining of “the incident” is that Cooper has met many other Black people who’ve gotten interested in birding, which delights him to no end. Months after the incident happened, he did a PBS special in which he talked about the “joys and challenges of birding while Black” and was featured in the Washington Post about his desire to diversify the activity. Birds have always meant liberation to Cooper. Alongside his memoir, he has a forthcoming National Geographic wildlife show in which he will examine birds across the US, including in his family’s ancestral land of Alabama. He hopes that readers and viewers alike can understand this symbolism. In his own words, as the birds sing above us, “Every place has atmosphere, every place has sky, and they just spread their wings and they can go anywhere. You know, the whole time we’ve been walking and talking, we can walk forward, we can walk back. We can walk left, we can walk right, but we can’t really go up or down very much unless, you know, we’re walking up a hill or down a hill. They just think it and they can go up or down under their own power. That freedom, that ability to think in three dimensions. All of that just makes birds incredibly inspiring.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a92d', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/swans-decapitated-attacks-waterfowl-england-wales-crimes-ducks-geese-police', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Swans decapitated amid rising attacks against waterfowl in England and Wales', 'lead': 'Police say 59% increase in crimes against swans, ducks and geese in 2020-22 may be ‘tip of the iceberg’', 'author': 'Mark Tovey', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 09:44:23', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560965', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/6b07cd8f66e5f1d2d89910fee0e6f5f547a9897b/0_147_4500_2700/500.jpg', 'body': 'Nine decapitated swans are among the victims of a rising number of sadistic attacks against waterfowl, according to police data. Police recorded a 59% increase in crimes against swans, ducks and geese from 2020 to 2022. The crimes ranged from fireworks and BB guns being shot into duck ponds to swans and geese being strangled and beheaded. Avon and Somerset police found the remains of two swans in a blood-filled bathtub surrounded by shotgun shells on open land. In Dorset, a decapitated swan was found by an underpass with an arrow sticking out of its body. Neighbouring Devon and Cornwall recorded three separate incidents of swans being decapitated, as well as a goose that had a stable door slammed and bolted on its neck. Three more swans were found with their heads chopped off in London, one in Merseyside and another in Avon and Somerset over the three-year period. A man in Cumbria was arrested after picking a swan up by its neck and throwing it at someone. Ducks have also been attacked. In Merseyside, youths were reported to police for shooting fireworks into a duck pond, while in Essex a mallard died after being shot with a BB gun. Avon and Somerset police said a large number of ducks were found tied up and drowned in the village of Yatton. Police in England and Wales recorded a total of 62 crimes against ducks, swans and geese between 2020 to 2022, based on data accessed under freedom of information laws by the Guardian. There were 27 crimes against these birds in 2022, up from 18 in 2021 and 17 in 2020. Essex (11), Merseyside (11) and Devon and Cornwall (nine) accounted for half of the nationwide tally. The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 protects wild birds, making it illegal to take, injure or kill them, or to damage or destroy their eggs or nests. Offenders face a maximum penalty of six months in prison and/or an unlimited fine. An RSPCA spokesperson said: “We say we’re a nation of animal lovers and yet every year we see wild animals in our wildlife centres and animal hospitals that have been badly injured or killed after being shot with a gun or catapult for ‘fun’ – or beaten, mutilated or poisoned. “Sadly, we suspect what we are seeing is just the tip of the iceberg, and there may be many more deliberately injured wild animals out there, which are never found and which die a drawn-out, painful death. “There is no place for cruelty to animals in today’s society and we urge anyone who spots suspicious activity when out and about or sees anything online to consult the RSPCA website for advice, or to speak to Crimestoppers or their local police force.” The Witham MP Priti Patel unveiled a memorial bench this year for a family of four swans that were killed by youths with catapults in Coggeshall, Essex. At the event in April, a local resident said: “The four mute swans were very much loved by local people and I am pleased that we have been able to find such a fitting way to commemorate their lives and the very great pleasure they brought to us all by their presence here.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a92e', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2023/jun/19/ditching-the-car-for-a-cargo-bike-on-the-school-run', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘In at the deep end’: ditching the car for a cargo bike on the school run', 'lead': 'The price tags can be eye-watering for the electric model I need around my hilly London neighbourhood', 'author': 'Rowena Mason', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 06:00:05', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.560983', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/ef1421ee7092e45032b160cbddd1eb63852dbe8e/0_1444_3499_2099/500.jpg', 'body': 'It’s been 20 years since I last used a bike every day. But I’m returning to cycling because I want to take my children to school and nursery without the horrible sense of guilt from dropping them off in the car, complaints about walking or the juggle of pushchair and public transport at rush-hour. To replace my car on the daily school run, I need an electrically powered workhorse that will carry two smallish children and the bags of stuff that we lug around wherever we go. The options, I’m told, are an elongated cargo bike that fits two children on the back, a detachable trailer, or a trike/bike with a giant child bucket on the front. In an ideal world, it will be powerful enough that I don’t feel dragged down by 30kg of offspring while chugging the household around my hilly London neighbourhood. The longtail electric cargo seems like the best fit for this brief. There are various “car replacement” bikes on the market with eye-watering price tags. The Tern GSD retails at £5k-plus at the top end. The model I choose to try out is a RadWagon, at the cheapest end of the market, though not actually cheap at more like £2,000 with all the necessary attachments. My main concern is whether I can keep my wriggling cargo safe. I spend a long time poring over Google maps to figure out a route that avoids buses and sticks to cycle paths and parks as much as possible. I also research parking, endlessly. And it seems this is one of the main disadvantages of a big, expensive bike. The advice is pretty much never to leave them unattended or on display for long. You can lock them up with as many locks as you like but nothing can stop a determined thief with an angle grinder – even in a public place in broad daylight. I decide it will have to be parked only at home, school or work. Finally, I am ready to borrow the bike from one of the handful of RadWagon partner outlets in London. It has been shipped and taken a week to “build” – the lead time for an order is usually about 10 days. The bikes are extremely popular in the US and mainland Europe but have not been without their problems, including a recall over tyre issues requiring new kit that took some months to be sent. In the UK, there are more than 500 RadWagon owners, and a handful of service outlets in London. Turning up at the shop, I admit I’ve never ridden an electric bike before and the assistant laughs, telling me the RadWagon is going “in at the deep end”. It is a beast, at 2 metres in length and 35kg in weight. But after a short trial round a nearby park, I decide to take the plunge and cycle 45 minutes home. It is in turns both exhilarating and terrifying. At top speed, I am approaching the 25km per hour with little effort on my part. The electric motor makes cycling feel like you’re gliding along. A nimble turn of the “throttle” is enough to almost flatten most hills, with major physical exertion required for only the steepest climbs. The tech is impressive. It has inbuilt lights that switch on with the electrics, a range of 55-88km a charge, an easy-to-read display and the ability to charge your phone on the go. The first hitch comes, though, in deciding where to put it. Outside seems too risky and it won’t fit in the shed. I settle for the hall although this could not be a long-term solution given its bulkiness. This is really a bike for people with garage space or the nerves and insurance to keep it chained in the garden under cover. When it comes to loading on my children, they give it a very positive review as comfy and fun. There are no complaints about the ride to school apart from when I take a speed bump too fast. I’m worried about fights breaking out behind me among tired passengers sitting close together, but they are too busy holding on and enjoying the ride for this to be a problem. The RadWagon is built to fit two Thule Yepp Maxi child seats for the youngest riders up until the age of about five. They are also not cheap and can be tricky to find secondhand but lovely, durable seats and easy to fit. Older children can ride with legs astride the central seat pads if they are confident holding on. Its maximum weight is 54kg, which is equivalent to about two children up to the age of eight or nine. Child-carrying cargo bikes are on the increase in London but they are not prevalent everywhere. The RadWagon attracts a lot of attention and compliments. A teenage boy stops to tell me I have “nice wheels” and I get curious looks from other parents. Several friends come round for a test. One who transports her children by non-electric cargo says she likes it but finds it a bit less responsive than her non-electric bucket bike. I still feel it is quite steady, if slightly cumbersome to wheel because of its size, with a low centre of gravity and thick tyres. It’s time to return the RadWagon and I’m considering whether to buy one of my own. The pull factors are the ease, fun and speed of travel, and the fact the children love it. The downsides are the price, parking and hassle if things go wrong. It feels like this type of cargo cycling is the future in cities – I think this really could replace a car, and be more enjoyable as a vehicle, for most local travel. But on a mass basis, this is only really going to happen as the cost comes down further.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a92f', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/jersey-hornet-hunters-guarding-against-invasion-uk-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Hornet hunters: the crack squad keeping an invasive species at bay on Jersey', 'lead': 'A retired police detective and a band of volunteers are all that’s stopping the Asian hornet, a voracious predator of flying insects, from spreading across the island to mainland Britain', 'author': 'Patrick Barkham', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 05:00:04', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561002', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/3bdb89eb3f49ab20425646eae6ed97f029b262c6/222_91_1485_892/500.jpg', 'body': 'John De Carteret has already taken a call about three captured Asian hornets when we meet on a gloriously sunny morning on the Channel Island of Jersey. The retired police forensics detective is the linchpin of the Jersey Asian Hornet Group (JAHG), a band of two dozen volunteers. These mostly retirees are the frontline troops in a seemingly unwinnable war against an invasive foe – a voracious predator of honeybees and all other flying insects, which has rapidly conquered the west European mainland. But De Carteret, who sports a JAHG polo-shirt and a lanyard showing he is authorised by the government to catch and release Asian hornets (more about the releasing later), is undaunted. “You can’t take your foot off. You’ve got to be dynamic and aggressive. If we get a report, we’re there within half an hour,” he says. Our first call is to a beautiful garden belonging to Tony and Nicky du Feu. Tony has been checking special hornet traps – a coffee cup-like contraption filled with a sugary lure – that he and his wife have placed around Jersey’s north-east corner. Nicky is fuming because her husband has caught three hornets. “It’s quite addictive and it’s quite competitive,” says Tony of their hornet-hunting. This year so far, they have trapped more than 10% of the 208 (and counting) queens caught across Jersey. “If we don’t achieve 10%, we’re not doing our job,” says Nicky. The Du Feus hand the traps to De Carteret. Inside one buzzes a slender, mostly black hornet, which is slightly smaller than the yellower native European hornet. The Asian hornet, Vespa velutina, has an orange face, narrow black wings, yellow legs and yellow-and-black stripes on the underside of its rear end. Remarkably, each individual is believed to be descended from one mated queen, which stowed away in plant pots from China bound for Marseille in 2004. Since then, the species has spread rapidly through France and into Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium. Britain has only had a few incursions – 23 from 2016-22 and four so far this year, which almost certainly hitched a lift on cross-Channel ferries and lorries. But the Jersey volunteers warn that an invasion is coming. There is a whiff of racism about an invading “Asian” hornet – hopefully, the species will become known as the yellow-legged hornet – but it appears to be a genuine threat to wildlife, and a voracious predator. As a beekeeper, Du Feu has watched hornets hovering outside the entrance to his hives, picking off worker bees laden with pollen as they return. Hornets create a landscape of fear, the bees stop foraging, and colonies collapse. But they don’t just threaten honeybees: by late summer, their nests are as big as an extremely large watermelon. French researchers estimated that a single nest can consume 11.3kg of insects over its late-summer lifetime. The economic and human health impacts of the hornets also trouble policymakers: their late-summer search for sugar has been found to damage grapes in Spain, while grape pickers can’t pluck the fruit by hand for fear of getting stung. Jersey, where the Asian hornet was first spotted in 2016, is seeking to repel the insect. If successful, it could give succour to the worried scientists, beekeepers and officials from all parts of Britain and Ireland who have visited the 46-sq mile island in the hope of finding a way to keep it out. Last year, volunteers working with the government detected and destroyed 174 nests. Of these, 117 were after worker hornets had been tracked through the countryside. “This year will show whether we can keep on top of it,” says Bob Tompkins, another JAHG volunteer who is the only islander so far to lose bee hives to the predator. Jersey’s efforts to keep the hornet at bay are both low- and hi-tech, ingenious and simple. The hornets overwinter as queens. In spring, these queens emerge and build their first, small nests. France is 14 miles from Jersey’s east coast, and while large numbers of hornets are unlikely to cross the Channel to Britain by flying, they can easily reach the island assisted by east and north-easterly winds. Every spring and summer, the volunteers must catch the emerging queens before they build nests and their numbers explode. A network of government-funded traps are hung across the island and must be checked every day to remove live bycatch – the last thing the volunteers want to do is kill more flying insects. Each captured queen is put in a freezer to kill it. The body is preserved and pinned by a volunteer researcher – this could be valuable data for future research. My next stop with De Carteret is to a queen’s early-summer nest, which has been reported as dangling above someone’s front door. “To me, this is like scene-of-crime work – going to one scene after another,” says De Carteret. “It gets you hooked.” This “embryo” nest is the size of a lightbulb and looks like a pretty paper lantern. We wait for 15 minutes but no hornet appears. There is no point destroying a nest without a queen. So De Carteret will return at dusk and put the little nest into a big container – if the queen is still alive, she will be inside at dusk, and captured. The key to finding hornets is to inform the public, says De Carteret. Thanks to plenty of media coverage on the island – and his popular Facebook page – many Jersey islanders can now identify them. “People need to know what these insects look like,” says De Carteret. “It’s a big problem but it’s a community problem.” His mobile rings constantly. The next call is from Jo Burke, who reports a suspected Asian hornet in her utility room on the south edge of the island. “I came back from walking the dog, heard a buzz and this huge great big thing flew towards me,” says Burke. “I thought, ‘I don’t like the look of that’ so I retreated. I went straight to the website and it said something about an orange face, and I thought, ‘that might be one’. It’s exciting but not in a good way. It’s not what we want on the island.” She is right: it’s a queen. De Carteret collects a small Perspex pot from his car and enters the utility room. The hornet is on the windowsill. He deftly covers it with the pot and slips on the lid. He’s not wearing any gloves or protective gear – only when trapped does the hornet buzz angrily. He has never been stung by an Asian hornet but he knows two people who were hospitalised after stings. De Carteret and his volunteers dislike sensationalist coverage and stress that the hornet is only aggressive if you get close to a big late-summer nest, when it wants to defend its offspring. In spring and early summer, the queens are laden with eggs and docile. “They are an incredibly successful insect,” he says. The volunteers’ battle intensifies in midsummer when the first workers emerge. First, they trap a worker with the usual lure. Then they mark it with special paint used by beekeepers to mark bees, release it, and set their watches. (It is an offence under Jersey law to release Asian hornets unless authorised.) Workers become habituated on the sugary lures, making shuttle runs between the traps and their nest. De Carteret discovered that it takes roughly one minute for a worker to fly 100 metres back to its nest and return again. It’s like map-making, he explains: a process of triangulation. Volunteers log times and distances on WhatsApp and work along the line of the hornet’s route until they find the nest. They also attach feathers or tiny streamers to workers to make them more visible in flight. It’s time-consuming fieldcraft: Tony and Nicky du Feu reckon it takes them 20 hours combined to find a single nest. Radio tags have been successfully used after trials by University of Exeter researchers, but so far the Jersey volunteers have found it a 45-minute fiddle to fit a tiny tracker to a hornet, which must be chilled before being revived. This year, however, the group’s researcher has devised a way of tying radio tags to hornets in just five minutes. Once located, summer nests must be destroyed as quickly as possible before a fresh generation of next year’s queens emerge. Destroying them isn’t simple: big nests are ferociously defended, and they are often in tall trees, so professional climbers are called in. Last summer, government climbers were not always available, leading to four-week delays in destroying nests on some occasions, which frustrated volunteers. Alastair Christie is the Jersey government’s senior scientific officer, responsible for invasive species, as well as a beekeeper himself. Managing his “extraordinary” volunteers is sometimes like “herding cats” he laughs, but he says he and all of Jersey are “tremendously grateful” for their efforts. This year, he has contracted and trained two tree surgery companies to do the climbing to minimise delays. He and his volunteers have also mastered the use of a telescopic lance which last year successfully injected poison into a nest 26 metres above the ground – minimising the need for professional tree-climbers. Success, he says, is restricting numbers to a manageable level. He agrees with volunteers that this is a “pivotal” year. If hornet numbers rise too high in midsummer, it becomes impossible to track individuals to nests because there are too many nests in different directions. “This year, it could turn into the exponential phase [of hornet numbers in Jersey],” he warns. “If we’ve worked our socks off, taken out 200 nests and there’s a sense that there are still another 20 nests out there, it all indicates we’re gradually losing control. Then we have to look at what is sustainable. Because this has to go on for ever. There’s no magic bullet, and for ever is rather a long time.” Given that the battle against the hornet appears to have been lost in mainland Europe, shouldn’t we simply accept it alongside other invasive non-native species, from grey squirrels to Japanese knotweed? “If it was good for our environment here it would’ve been here all along,” says Matt Goetz, curator for invertebrates at Jersey zoo. “We have the European hornet here, and that’s the hornet that fits into our environment. A hornet evolved in Asia has a different reproductive output and different behaviour. It might not have the properties that mean that predators go for it. It might have bigger nests than our European hornet. It might have a bigger appetite, and eat species that aren’t adapted to cope with the pressure. That’s particularly problematic in already damaged environments. “With invasive species, if they have a way in and can reproduce in small numbers it’s very hard to completely eradicate them but you can keep on top of it. By trying, you are gaining so much knowledge and experience that you often find a way to have permanent success.” In addition, says Goetz, such efforts are often transferable to other invasive species or ecological problems. “It is absolutely and categorically never in vain. Even if it doesn’t 100% work, you get so much experience and the public sensitised to the issues – people join in the radio tracking and become conservationists, or Jersey zoo staff.” In a way, the Asian hornet is a recruitment tool for conservation and the cause of flying insects. While Christie believes the British government is taking the right approach by using beekeepers as its eyes and ears, Jersey volunteers are sceptical about Britain’s chances of keeping the Asian hornet at bay. By the end of the day, De Carteret has incarcerated eight more hornets. The following day 11 queens are discovered – a daily record. Either hornet numbers are booming or the volunteers are becoming more efficient at trapping them, or both. De Carteret tries to remain optimistic. “We’re definitely suppressing the numbers,” he says. But what happens if they reach Britain? “I dread to think,” says Tompkins. “We are a very small island, we’ve got a good local knowledge base of the environment and where things are. There’s very little space on this island that isn’t observed. “In Britain, if they ever got into the New Forest for instance, they could tick away there for several years without being noticed, get established, and then off and away.” If you suspect you have seen an Asian hornet in the UK report the sighting through the iPhone and Android app Asian Hornet Watch or by using this online report form.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a931', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/australia-needs-to-reduce-emissions-to-net-zero-by-2038-to-do-fair-share-to-contain-global-heating-analysis-shows', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Australia needs to reduce emissions to net zero by 2038 to do ‘fair share’ to contain global heating, analysis shows', 'lead': '<strong>Exclusive</strong>: Researchers say government’s climate schedule needs to be brought forward by a decade to keep heating to 1.5C', 'author': 'Graham Readfearn', 'datePublished': '2023-06-18 22:57:46', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561038', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/01a31b7d983e658c01ecc880638e91f40caa4a70/0_156_4666_2800/500.jpg', 'body': 'Australia’s fair share of action to give the world a chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C would mean reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2038 – more than a decade ahead of the government’s schedule, according to new scientific analysis. To stay on track to keep global heating of 1.5C within reach – a goal the climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen has described as vital – Australia’s 2035 target would need to see a cut of 90% on 2005 levels by 2035, the analysis says. The research, from two leading scientists who contributed to the UN climate panel’s assessment of how quickly global emissions will need to drop, points to how far Australia has to go to legitimately claim its targets are in line with the 1.5C goal. The Albanese government has already updated the country’s target to a 43% cut on 2005 levels by 2030 – an improvement on the Morrison government’s 26% commitment. In a briefing report commissioned by WWF-Australia, associate professor Malte Meinshausen and Dr Zebedee Nicholls of Climate Resource say the improved target would need to have been “at least 67%” to have been in line with 1.5C. While Australia has a net zero target by 2050, Meinshausen and Nicholls say this net zero date should be 2038 based on Australia’s “fair share” of effort. Nicholls said: “We are at the point where we need to be going for maximum possible ambition. Every mitigation option that we have we need to look at seriously. “This is the minimum that Australia should be looking at if we’re serious about 1.5C.” The concept of what a “fair share” of effort represents is contested and not agreed between countries. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The new analysis considers how much the entire planet could emit – known as the carbon budget – while giving a 50% chance of keeping global temperatures to 1.5C. The new analysis gives Australia a 0.97% share of that global budget, a figure taken from a 2014 Climate Change Authority report that sees developed countries making faster cuts to allow developing countries more time to decarbonise. That 0.97% share is considered generous, the authors said, because Australia makes up only 0.33% of the planet’s population. According to Climate Resource, the government’s current plans would lead to 7.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent being released by Australia between 2021 and 2050, which was “roughly double” a budget of 4bn tonnes “for a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C.” Prof Frank Jotzo, a climate policy expert at Australian National University, said it was “impossible to pin down” what the “fair share” of any country’s efforts on emissions reductions would look like “because there are so many value judgments that need to be made”. But he said to pass any “plausibility test” for a 1.5C-aligned commitment, emissions reductions would need to be “extremely rapid, deep and sustained” and Australia’s current policy ambition was “not in line with 1.5C”. Keeping global temperatures close to 1.5C would reduce the impacts of heatwaves, sea level rise, temperature extremes and give ecosystems such as Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef a better chance of avoiding collapse. The government will set its 2035 target in 2025 after the Climate Change Authority issues advice in 2024. The authority is in the middle of a community consultation process on that issue. Last month, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, wrote to Unesco to promote the federal and Queensland government’s steps to conserve the reef after a UN-backed monitoring mission called for a series of new measures. In the letter, Plibersek wrote the government was committed to setting “successively more ambitious emissions reduction targets” that would be “in alignment with efforts to limit global temperature increase to 1.5C”. Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF-Australia, said: “Australia needs to do its fair share. We can’t expect the rest of the world to do the heavy lifting to save the Great Barrier Reef. Australia has to set the example and give the reef a fighting chance.” In a statement, Unesco said together with its science advisers it was finalising an assessment of the reef that was “expected to be public in July” and “a final decision over whether Australia’s commitments are sufficient or not will be decided by the world heritage committee in September”. Guardian Australia asked minister’s Bowen’s office if the government considered its 2050 date for net zero to be in line with the country’s “fair share” of global effort to keep temperatures to 1.5C, and what criteria it would use to make that assessment. Those questions were not answered, but a spokesperson said the government was implementing strong policies to achieve its “ambitious” 2030 and 2050 targets. Under the new Climate Change Act, the Climate Change Authority’s advice on the 2035 target to be updated in 2025 would give “specific consideration to the temperature goals” of the Paris agreement, the spokesperson said. Queensland is the largest-emitting state but its 2030 emissions reduction target remains stuck at 30% by 2030 and well behind other states. The Queensland environment minister, Leanne Linard, said 2021 data showed the state had almost reached its 2030 goal “nine years ahead of time” and the government was “committed to meeting its overall goal of zero net emissions by 2050, in line with leading global economies”.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a932', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/18/flood-warnings-issued-for-england-as-parts-of-the-north-are-deluged', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Flood warnings issued for England as parts of the north are deluged', 'lead': 'As much as 35mm of rain fell in an hour near Sheffield and Met Office says weather could get even worse ', 'author': 'Tom Ambrose and agency', 'datePublished': '2023-06-18 21:51:28', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561058', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/8cbb031db95e2c88dedcbe64c7b889700ffe309e/108_0_3285_1972/500.jpg', 'body': 'Flood warnings will be in place across England going into Monday morning after almost half a month’s worth of rain fell in one hour on Sunday. Thunder and lightning swept across the north throughout the evening, as 35.6mm of rain fell in Woodhouse Mill, near Sheffield between 6pm and 7pm. In June so far, the UK has averaged 12 days of rain, totalling 77mm, PA Media reported. Rain and thunderstorms caused the Met Office to issue six flood warnings on Sunday night, with forecaster Marco Petagna warning the weather could get even worse. “Half a month’s of rain has fallen in one hour in one location, in quite a few spots we’re seeing 15-20mm, even 30mm in an hour,” he said on Sunday night. “There’s been quite a few storms embedded within that area of northern England, Northern Ireland and one or two in parts of Wales. “It’s pretty torrential, 25 to 35mm in an hour is certainly going to cause some flooding problems, and there’s still potentially bad conditions to come.” The rain caused play to be halted in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham due to the wet weather, and it was reported people had to be rescued from flooding in Yorkshire. A yellow thunderstorm warning almost entirely covered England and Wales between noon and midnight, and there was also one until 9pm in Northern Ireland. It warned of heavy showers, the potential for frequent lightning, strong winds and hail – which could cause flooding, travel issues and power cuts. In northern England and Scotland, a yellow heavy rain warning is in place from 7pm on Sunday until noon on Monday. There are generally moderate or high UV levels across the UK, despite there being more cloud, while grass and nettle pollen are also very strong, the Met Office said. Temperatures reached the low 20s – despite the UK being in an area of low pressure. Sarah Cook of the Environment Agency said: “On Sunday afternoon and into the night, slow-moving heavy showers and thunderstorms could lead to localised surface water flooding across England. “Environment Agency teams are out on the ground and will support local authorities in responding to surface water flooding.” The Environment Agency said it believed flooding was possible across the Midlands and parts of Yorkshire and the Humber, and east and south-east England.

The Labour leader will seek to regain the initiative on his plan for green growth on Monday, having rowed back earlier this month on a pledge to invest £28bn in a green industrial strategy, a figure that will not now be reached until the second half of a Labour parliament, as well as damaging rows with trade unions over the future of the North Sea. Announcing a package of policies designed to decarbonise the energy system and industry, Starmer will say: “We’re going to throw everything at this: planning reform, procurement, long-term finance, R&amp;D, a strategic plan for skills and supply chains … Pulling together for a simple, unifying priority: British power for British jobs.” Labour’s plans include sweeping changes to the planning system that will allow onshore wind farms, electricity lines, transport links and other low-carbon infrastructure to be built quickly. All regulators will be given instructions to prioritise low-carbon projects, and companies will be given assurances on long-term policy to encourage investment. Speaking in Scotland, Starmer will contrast the opportunities for investing in a low-carbon economy with the devastation of the UK’s industrial heartlands under Margaret Thatcher. “This cannot be a re-run of the 1980s,” he will say. “This is the race of our lifetime, and the prize is real.” Labour’s plans for renewable energy, including a ban on new oil and gas exploration and development in the North Sea, have come under attack, from the Conservatives and trade unions. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, accused the Labour leader of being “the political wing” of Just Stop Oil. Starmer will counter by arguing net zero is vital to the UK’s safety. “We live in an increasingly volatile world. The twin risks of climate change and energy security now threaten the stability of nations,” he will say. “So we’ve got to ground everything we do in a new insight – that clean energy is now essential for national security.” His team also rebuffed suggestions of a U-turn on the North Sea oil ban. Rescinding permission for projects that have cleared all regulatory hurdles before the general election would be costly and legally complex, so the party’s proposed ban on new oilfields will not cover projects that have achieved all three levels of consent, for exploration, development and production. It is unlikely that many of the more than 100 North Sea licences the government is mulling would fall into that category, though one of the biggest – the Rosebank oil and gas field – could clear the final regulatory hurdles soon. Labour’s plans also include insulating 19 million homes, setting up a national energy company, decarbonising electricity supply by 2030 and a national wealth fund to invest in green infrastructure. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, told the Guardian the package would transform the UK’s economy. “This is a transformative agenda to bring lower bills, more jobs, energy security and climate leadership,” he said. “Labour is seizing the future, in stark contrast to the Tories, who have abandoned the pitch on this agenda.” New analysis by Carbon Brief found less gas would be imported by 2030 under Labour’s plans than under Tory policies, despite the proposed ban on new North Sea drilling. Planning policies for onshore wind and pylon construction are devolved to the Scottish and Welsh governments: in Wales, the Labour-led government is likely to be willing partners on this strategy. In Scotland, Labour needs to negotiate with the Scottish National party and Scottish Green government in Edinburgh, but would expect its support. Labour’s plans met approval from Sam Richards, former Tory party adviser to Boris Johnson. “It’s great news that Keir Starmer has put reforming our broken planning system at the heart of Labour’s plans to deliver the clean energy infrastructure that can cut our energy bills and create jobs,” said Richards, the founder of the campaign group Britain Remade. “I’m delighted that Labour have adopted many of the recommendations set out in [our March] report, from ending the senseless ban on new onshore wind farms to speeding up the time it takes to get offshore wind farms up and running.” Starmer’s choice of Edinburgh for the launch reflects Labour’s need to win seats from the SNP as well as the Tories in England. A new Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times put the SNP and Labour neck and neck on 34%, suggesting Labour is on course to win 26 Westminster seats in Scotland. It currently holds one in Scotland. The headquarters of the new state-owned energy company GB Energy promised by Labour is to be based in Scotland, in a signal to Scottish voters the country would benefit directly from a UK Labour government. Starmer will say: “Neither [SNP nor Tories] are truly invested in Scotland’s success. For the SNP, any Scottish triumph in Britain is a threat to the ultimate prize. While the Tories welcome such division because they think it works for them, politically.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a934', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/18/cows-sustainable-farming-silvopasture', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'The best way to raise cows sustainably?

The farm, Angus Glen, has lush green pastures and wooded areas, where black walnut and black locust trees stretch skyward out of rolling seas of tall grasses, shrubs and clovers. When Chedzoy, 54, walks through the pasture at sunset, the cows pop their heads up, follow him and wait patiently at the gate. As he pulls it aside, the cows rush forward into the wooded area to nibble on tree branches and shrubs, before turning their attention to the emerald grass around the trees. Here, the cows don’t only live on pastures, as you’d expect – they also live in the woods. “When you move into a fresh paddock, it’s fun to watch them for the first five minutes because they’ll walk over and they’ll take a little bit of this and a little bit of that,” said Chedzoy, also an agroforestry educator at the Cornell Cooperative Extension. “They instantly know that’s good for me, that’s not good for me – they’re self-medicating.” It’s an old farming technique called silvopasture, in which cattle graze on a variety of plants, either in forests that have been thinned and planted with grasses and shrubs, or pastureland that’s been planted with widely spaced trees. Considered better for the environment and less emissions-intensive than most other forms of cattle production, silvopasture is seeing a resurgence around the world with major efforts to expand its usage in Canada, Brazil and the Mediterranean. And now, in part through Chedzoy’s work, in the US as well. Chedzoy first learned about silvopasture while serving in the Peace Corps in Argentina in the early 1990s. Beef is a staple of the diet there, but cattle are also used to provide key fire-prevention services by grazing away potential fuel in forests. “That opened my mind,” said Chedzoy. When he moved back to New York, on to poor-quality farmland that his father had bought years before, he and Maria wanted to use the land. Not satisfied with the quality or price of grocery store beef, they started with just two cows and their calves in 2003. As the herd grew, he ran out of space in the old dairy barn he’d been using to hold them in winter. The solution was raising them on silvopasture instead. Rather than building another barn, he started using forests as a natural shelter to keep his cows protected from the wind and snow in winter, and the heat of sunshine the summer. In addition to saving him money, doing so has been found to help cattle reach their target body weight quicker than those in direct sun, since they need to spend less energy on regulating their body temperature. There are many other benefits to silvopasture for cattle, farmers and ecosystems. Silvopasture gives cows choice in where to be and what to eat, which Karolini Tenffen de Sousa, a postdoctoral fellow at Instituto de Zootecnia in Brazil who specializes in cattle behavior, says can improve their health. Cows can be in the shade when they want, drink water when they want, and graze when they want. “If they don’t experience stress their physiology will be good,” she said. According to a 2017 study from the Center for Agroforestry at the University of Missouri, silvopasture can also extend the grazing season, so that it starts earlier in spring and lasts longer in fall compared to open pasture. Forage also grows better in silvopastures during the hottest times of the summer compared to open pasture, the study found. “The silvopastures are gold during droughts,” Chedzoy said. “The plants don’t wither and burn up like they do in the shadeless pastures.” Chedzoy says the cows’ diet of grass, forage and hay that he harvests in the summer means he doesn’t need to supplement his feed with protein meal or additional roughage the way many farmers do. And having the cows spread out across the forest all year long – instead of being stuck in a barn during the winter – means their waste doesn’t pollute the local watershed. And silvopasture allows for many layers of biodiversity compared to grasslands. They support a wider variety of bird species, more pollinators, bigger and more diverse mammals, and a much wider variety of plant life with more varied root systems. But it also requires careful management and daily rotation, as livestock can damage trees by trampling roots. This wear and tear can go unnoticed for years, and once the damage is visible, it can be too late to save those valuable trees. While research is still in early stages, Project Drawdown, a leading organization promoting climate solutions, has heralded silvopasture as an agricultural solution to the climate crisis due to hopes it can increase carbon sequestration through plants pulling carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, sinking it into soils, and holding it in their own biomass. Alix Contosta, a research assistant professor at University of New Hampshire who focuses on the relationship between land use and climate, says that her research has shown that carbon and nitrous oxide emissions were lower in silvopastures compared to areas that were clear cut or in treeless pasture, meaning cattle on silvopasture has lower emissions. In addition, most silvopastures, like Chedzoy’s, don’t require emissions-intensive fertilizers or feed that has to be grown and shipped to the farm, further reducing the impact on the climate. But farmers often need support in getting silvopastures off the ground. Some experts point out that while there is federal funding available to help farmers start silvopastures, it’s often difficult to access because of bureaucratic red tape and the time-consuming application process. Still, the technique is gaining popularity. Chedzoy has been encouraged by the increasing popularity of his courses and trainings and by young farmers following in his footsteps who are committed to regenerating their land with agroforestry. Katherine Carestio considers him a mentor. She’s a young farmer who first encountered silvopasture at Angus Glen. She now runs Backbone Farm in Trumansburg, New York. Along with her husband Jamie, she owns a small herd of Red Devons mixed with Chedzoy’s Black Angus. She said Chedzoy helped them set up their farm and silvopasture, guiding them through questions about infrastructure and management and lending them a bull before they got their own. In the last two decades, Chedzoy has watched silvopasture go from something nearly unheard of in the region, to a much discussed climate solution. He sees a future with hundreds of thousands of acres of silvopasture in New York. “We can grow more of what we need in our own backyards,” he said. “And do it in a way that’s a win-win for the environment and the animals and the farms and even the whole community.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a935', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/18/countries-are-drowning-climate-expert-calls-for-urgent-rethink-on-scale-of-aid-for-developing-world', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Countries are drowning’: climate expert calls for urgent rethink on scale of aid for developing world', 'lead': 'World needs to offer trillions, not billions in overseas support, says leading climate economist Avinash Persaud', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey Environment Editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-18 08:00:38', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561113', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/64b49089579243fe5fd575cdb5448767c94f1d54/0_339_5120_3074/500.jpg', 'body': 'The world must rethink its approach to the climate crisis, by investing trillions of dollars instead of billions in the developing world, and moving beyond conventional ideas of overseas aid, one of the world’s most influential climate economists has urged. “We need a complete rethink of the whole nexus of climate, debt and development,” Avinash Persaud told the Observer, before a key summit. “What we are seeing today is new – countries affected by climate disaster, this is happening now. Countries are drowning.” He called for a tripling of the finance available from the World Bank and similar institutions, and a huge influx of cash from the private sector, driven by the careful use of public funds and regulation to remove the current barriers to investment. “This is the biggest financial opportunity in the world,” he said. Persaud is economic adviser to Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, who is co-hosting a meeting of world leaders this week with French president Emmanuel Macron. More than 50 heads of state and government are expected to attend the summit in Paris this Thursday and Friday, including Lula da Silva of Brazil, Germany’s Olaf Scholtz and the Chinese premier Li Qiang. Rishi Sunak is likely to snub the conference. Joe Biden is sending his climate envoy, John Kerry. In Paris, Mottley and Persaud will set out the “Bridgetown agenda”, named after the Barbados capital where it was first mooted last year. They will call for debt relief for some of the poorest nations facing climate catastrophe, a tripling of funding from the world’s multilateral development banks, including the World Bank, and new taxes to fund climate action, including, potentially, a levy on shipping. They will also call for reforms to the way the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other institutions operate, to make it easier for them to “de-risk” private sector investment in developing countries, such as by providing guarantees or long-term loans. “The private sector has to be involved,” Persaud said. “The numbers needed would swamp developing countries’ balance sheets, but private companies can do it.” Persaud values pragmatism above ideals, and above traditional economic thinking. “If you ask economists for ideas, they will come up with an infinite number of ideas that are clever, elegant – and completely impractical,” he said. Many approaches have been tried or discussed, he points out: insurance for countries at risk of climate disaster; raising money from carbon offsets; green and blue bonds. “None of these is the answer,” he said. Some of the cherished ideals of many campaigners will also have to be sacrificed, he warns. NGOs rail against the use of loans for climate finance, saying non-repayable grants should be given instead, but Persaud finds this unlikely. “Waiting for grants from rich countries is like waiting for Godot,” he said. Conventional overseas aid will also never be enough, Persaud added. “These sums are far too big, we need to think beyond that.” Work by the distinguished UK economist Nicholas Stern, and Vera Songwe, last year found that about $2tn a year would be needed to transform the economies of developing countries to cut emissions and enable them to deal with the effects of extreme weather. While this sum seems large, it is not much greater than the investment that is currently poured into fossil fuels and high-carbon infrastructure. Persaud breaks this down further, estimating that about $1.4tn a year will be needed from mainly the private sector, for the green transformation of poor countries; about $300bn will be needed to help them adapt to the effects of the climate crisis; and about $100bn a year must go to “loss and damage”, which is the rescue of countries stricken by climate catastrophe. Calls for reform of the World Bank, to enable it to deal with devastating effects of the climate crisis on poor countries, have intensified in the past year. The former president, Trump appointee David Malpass, resigned earlier this year after struggling to defend his apparent climate sceptic views, and his replacement Ajay Banga, a former banker, is thought to be amenable to change. Persaud contrasted the treatment of developing countries today with the terms that were agreed by the World Bank in its early days for the reconstruction of Europe after the second world war. “Germany was told its debt repayments would never exceed 3.5% of its exports,” he said. “Those are terms the developing world would love to see today.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a936', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/18/no-swimming-no-surfing-how-a-summer-of-sewage-is-ruining-the-british-seaside-day-out', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'No swimming, no surfing: how a summer of sewage is ruining the British seaside day out', 'lead': 'Red flags are going up on beaches from Scarborough to Whitstable as pollution levels soar and businesses are forced to close due to sewage discharges', 'author': 'Harriet Grant', 'datePublished': '2023-06-18 06:00:35', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561132', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/772dcdf3976588d378a03cb5eea4e841ca4347bb/0_329_5687_3414/500.jpg', 'body': 'The sun has been shining on Scarborough’s South Bay all week, but Steve Crawford isn’t opening up the surf shop he’s so proud of – “mahogany door, views over to the castle” – because the water isn’t safe to swim in. “My business has vanished overnight,” he says. “On coronation weekend, the red flags went up warning people not to go in the water because of poor water quality, and now there are signs at every access point to the beach saying ‘No swimming’.” Poor water quality linked to pollution has been a problem here for many years. But this is the first time Crawford has had to shut completely. “Most days I can’t face coming down here,” he says. “I’ve been surfing since I was nine, I’ve run the shop in this old Victorian spa building for 17 years. Right now, I should be sitting outside, drinking coffee and chatting to people about surfing. But it’s all gone. My livelihood has evaporated.” In a place like Scarborough, summer really matters: this is when the town comes alive, with donkeys and colourful bucket-and-spade shops filled with excited children. But here and across the country, just as Britain’s beaches should be filling up, sewage and pollution are shutting them down. The figures are alarming. Between 15 May and 30 September last year, sewage was dumped into designated bathing waters more than 5,000 times. There were an average of 825 sewage spills every single day into England’s waterways in 2022. In the north west, United Utilities discharged untreated sewage almost 70,000 times last year, while Severn Trent Water discharged sewage through storm overflows 44,765 times in the same period. In just a single eight-day stretch, Southern Water dumped more than 3,700 hours’ worth of sewage at 83 bathing water beaches. The country’s most popular beach destinations have been suffering. Earlier this week eight beaches on the Fylde coast – including the iconic Blackpool Central – were shut to the public after a storm and heavy rain led to a massive sewage discharge by United Utilities. Down south in Whitstable, they are having to order oysters in from elsewhere to replace their own shellfish, which have been contaminated by Southern Water dumping sewage. At West’s Whelks, Graham West says that with the arrival of summer, things are simply getting worse. “It’s open, shut, open, shut with our shops, just as the busy summer period arrives, because our oysters – or the water we need to keep them in – are contaminated,” he says. “Last week, I was due to get a load of oysters in but Southern Water decided to dump sewage into the sea – that means I can’t collect water for the oysters to be kept in. Our policy is three days post-sewage spill. “So I had to buy them in from Jersey. One single loss of around £1,000 over a week. And yet thousands more houses are planned for Whitstable– the sewage system can’t cope as it is.” Katy Taylor, chief customer officer for Southern Water, said: “We recognise how important the fishing industry is to the area. We’re investing over £25m on upgrades to our nearby wastewater treatment works, to improve capacity and reliability.” On every coastline, people whose livelihoods depend on the great British seaside day out are raising the alarm about the impact of pollution – and not just on tourism. Scarborough’s South Bay sits in Castle ward, one of the poorest in the UK. This week, Crawford has had to cancel surfing trips for children at a local pupil referral unit, which hosts children who struggle in school. “They were coming down once a week to get away from the stress they face,” he says. “This beach means a lot to people.” Crawford has been involved in campaigns for cleaner water here for years – and some nearby beaches are clean and safe. But two weeks ago, when a national Surfers against Sewage protest was held, South Bay was the only beach where surfers were told it was not safe to enter the water for their protest. Although the reasons for poor water quality along Yorkshire’s coast are various – as Yorkshire Water is keen to stress – one cause is sewage overspill, carried by pipes that dump human effluent directly into the bays. The government also acknowledges a nearby industrial pipe from a McCain’s chip factory – managed by Yorkshire Water – “may” be contaminating the water. Work is going on to improve this situation. Yorkshire Water is monitored by the Environment Agency (EA). Both say complex factors affect water quality on local beaches – from seagulls to dogs and agricultural run-off. Yorkshire Water says it has spent more than £100m in recent years improving local processing facilities. “We are intending to bring forward investment from 2025-2030 to meet the government’s storm overflow reduction plan … of an average of two spills per bathing water season,” it says. Meanwhile, the sewage keeps coming. A massive discharge near Blackpool on Tuesday comes after 69,000 such events last year across the UK’s north-west from United Utilities. Yet the company still found the money to pay £300m in dividends to shareholders. “The advice not to swim is unprecedented,” says Michelle Buckley in Lytham, who runs a local swimming group. “We do keep an eye on pollution through an app, but I’ve never known this happen before.” Chris Webb, the Labour parliamentary candidate for Blackpool South, says: “It’s glorious sunshine here – and the beaches are out of bounds for tourists and local children, many of whom live in poverty. “United Utilities did a major upgrade a few years ago that was supposed to prevent this, so it’s remarkable to see such a massive spill. This council has worked hard to get these beaches to a good standard. We had 19 million visitors to Blackpool last year – now many people will think twice about coming.” A spokesperson for United Utilities says the storm impact was worsened by a damaged pipe that reduced site capacity, adding: “On Monday night, following intense rain, several storm overflows operated on the Fylde coast. If the current dry weather continues we are confident that the storm overflows will not operate again. The Environment Agency and local authorities will provide updates on when the advice not to swim can be lifted. “The work to repair the pipe at our treatment works continues round the clock.” Fighting off a bad reputation caused by corporate polluting is becoming a common challenge for Britain’s beach communities. Just 60 miles down the coast from Blackpool is New Brighton, also covered by United Utilities. It’s a beautiful beach at the top of the Wirral peninsula, yet the area has been found in recent studies to be highly polluted. “Look one way and you see an urban landscape – Liverpool freeport and the town. Then look left and it’s these gorgeous sand hills and rocky cliffs, it’s stunning,” says Cathy Roberts, who runs a bookshop in New Brighton and is campaigning for cleaner water. “It’s not an entirely fair label to say we are so polluted, it depends what day you take the readings. But yes, there is a problem. It has been confirmed to us by United Utilities that because of the tides we get pollution not just from our local area but from other places – Manchester, Cheshire.” In 2022, there were 1,149 sewage dumps in Wirral that affected New Brighton. A local paper recently reported that swimmers had been forced out of the water by a “big brown stream”, although United Utilities said the incident was not related to its operations. Roberts says the community is doing what it can. “We are a visitor economy and we need people to keep enjoying our beautiful beach. We are trying to work constructively with United Utilities. And we have a brilliant beach patrol group here: just yesterday, one of them noticed some grey sludge on the evening tide. So we will get photos and a sample and pass that on.” But she laughs at the idea that the council, or the water company, might pay for the clean-up. “We don’t even have public toilets here, despite asking for years. You have to just get this done, don’t you?” United Utilities says: “Since 1991, we have spent around £3bn in our treatment works and sewer systems in the Mersey basin. We’re pleased this investment has already had a positive impact with the wide variety of aquatic life that continues to return to the Mersey.” In his green tabard, Dave Peddie is a familiar sight on the beach. With his wife and a group of committed local people known as the New Brightonians, he has been picking up litter and noting floating sewage for 11 years. “I can’t even tell you what I see, it defies description,” he says. “We see it particularly after heavy rain … The water company are 20 years behind with this.

Keir Starmer and shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband will spell out how a new public body, GB Energy, will join forces with local government, communities and the private sector with the aim of creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and bringing down household energy bills. The Local Power Plan will see projects such as solar panels being put on public land or the roofs of housing estates, and empower communities to come forward with their own bespoke projects for renewable energy projects directly owned by local people. It will also encourage partnerships with the Scottish and Welsh governments and with regional mayors to help them develop their own local clean power plans. A key condition of GB Energy putting in public money would be that local communities would have to see financial benefits from the part they were playing in the clean power revolution. Starmer and Miliband will announce that GB Energy will make available up to £600m in funding for local authorities and up to £400m in low-interest loans each year for communities, creating up to a million owners of renewable power by 2030. Profits from the energy that would be sold to the grid from local renewable schemes would be given back to the communities through discounts on council tax or help with energy bills for those who are most in need. Earlier this month Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, scaled back plans to borrow £28bn a year to invest in green jobs and industry in reaction to the negative economic backdrop and to bolster Labour’s reputation for fiscal credibility. But the party remains determined to keep plans for a green industrial revolution at the heart of its policy programme, seeing it as a way to boost the economy, create jobs, bring down energy bills and tackle climate change. Labour’s plans stand in stark contrast with Tory policy, under which planning rules have in effect put a block on more onshore wind energy just as world leaders increase the urgency of their calls to tackle global warming. Ed Miliband said: “GB Energy is about putting power and wealth back in the hands of the British people. “For the first time in generations, a public institution will be building energy across Britain, and the profits will go directly to working people. “In their towns, cities and villages, we want the British people to see the benefits of Labour’s clean energy revolution in lower bills and jobs. “This is just the start of the transformation of our energy system and our economy that a Labour government will bring.” The scheme will align Britain with the established practice in European countries. The early success of wind cooperatives in Denmark means 52% of wind energy is community owned, and in Germany at least 50% of onshore wind is citizen owned. “The next Labour government will be builders, not blockers, when it comes to clean power,” said Starmer. “I want local people to see the benefit of that power, and with Labour they will. We will bring power home with our GB Energy, a publicly owned energy company building clean power for the first time in generations, with the profits flowing back to the British people. “People want to know what our plans mean for their community: from onshore wind in Wales to rooftop solar panels in our cities to community energy in Scotland, Labour will seize the power of Britain’s sun, wind and water to put clean power in the grid and profits in the pockets of the British people.” Miliband added: “In every other country driving forward with clean power, publicly owned energy generation is creating wealth and benefitting local people.”The UK, he said, “needs a plan to put an end to the energy bills crisis once and for all”.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a938', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/17/water-companies-feel-the-heat-as-commercial-bans-loom-in-dry-summer', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Water companies feel the heat as commercial bans loom in dry summer', 'lead': 'Suppliers may be forced to cut large-scale usage by businesses amid fears of a repeat of last year’s heatwave', 'author': 'Alex Lawson', 'datePublished': '2023-06-17 15:20:06', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561167', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/5942eec2c26144738aa0988940a1ebb76ad97cfc/0_0_2210_1326/500.jpg', 'body': 'If water industry bosses think they are having a stinking time of it, they should cast their minds back to when Trevor Newton was head of Yorkshire Water. Urging customers to reduce consumption in balmy 1995, he confessed he had “not had a bath or shower in three months”. As a bout of sweltering weather grips Britain, with forecasts of a baking summer, there are concerns that a widespread drought and a repeat of last year’s heatwave could force water suppliers to ban certain companies from using large quantities. It promises to be a fresh headache for an industry already under fire over sewage dumping, leakage rates, large dividends, a £10bn customer-funded investment plan and “flimsy” pledges to give up bonuses. In April, the National Drought Group – a collection of business and government leaders – urged water companies and the public to preserve water before future dry spells. And last week, South East Water announced a hosepipe ban would come into effect across Kent and Sussex from 26 June, after shortages forced schools to shut and residents to rely on emergency bottled water stations. Water levels in English reservoirs fell to a low of 49% last September, according to the Environment Agency. However, the driest February in England for 30 years was followed by a very wet March, and by last month they had recovered to at least 82%. However, the burst of recent hot weather has put businesses in the areas seen as most vulnerable, the south-west and East Anglia, on alert. In Cornwall, Colliford Lake, a reservoir on Bodmin Moor, is at about 65% of capacity, down on nearly 77% a year earlier, while Anglian Water has warned that areas of Norfolk remain in the drought conditions that began last summer. South West Water (SWW) enforced its first hosepipe ban in 26 years in Cornwall and north Devon last autumn. Unusually, the ban remained in place through the winter as reserves remained low, and was extended further into Devon in late April. For local residents, this has prevented them from watering gardens, refilling ponds and cleaning private boats. However, if dry conditions continue, SWW may be forced to apply to Ofwat, the water regulator for England and Wales, to implement a “non-essential use ban”. These bans mean that for businesses, a host of practices would be outlawed, including operating mechanical car washes, and cleaning boats, aircraft and trains, as well as industrial plants. SWW admitted in last year’s drought plan that such a move would only deliver a 2.5% reduction in demand on top of the domestic hosepipe ban and even delivering that figure was highly dependent on whether it coincided with “peak tourist and holiday periods”. If there are still shortages, an emergency drought order can be called, limiting supplies and making alternative water supply arrangements such as a stand pipe in the street. The orders last for three months and can be extended by a further two months. Any ban could prove politically toxic for SWW, owned by the listed Pennon Group, which is being investigated by the industry regulator over whether it accurately reported leaks and figures showing how much water was used by its customers during 2021 and 2022. Meanwhile, a £112m dividend payout to investors by the Pennon Group was this month labelled a “slap in the face” for communities hit by sewage dumping. At Anglian Water, a business ban would prevent cleaning of industrial facilities and the windows of office blocks, car washes, filling non-public pools and watering plants on commercial premises. Dust suppression – often used on industrial sites to reduce airborne dust to improve visibility and prevent diseases such as “farmer’s lung” – would also be prohibited. In East Anglia, farmers have already begun cutting back on high-risk irrigated crops such as potatoes, onions and carrots. The Environment Agency has said it will use satellite data to compare the moisture of crops and soil with irrigation restrictions, to study whether water abstractors – those taking large amounts of water from underground or surface sources such as streams, for example, farmers – are acting within their licence conditions. Companies are required to pay households £10 a day if their water supply is cut off, up to a maximum of last year’s entire bill. For businesses, it is £50 a day and a maximum of their annual bill.However, suppliers are off the hook if Ofwat deems the circumstances “exceptional”, such as a non-essential use ban, leaving companies facing thousands in lost business and delayed bills. In an emergency, the suppliers are required to provide 10 litres of water for each person within a day, distributing bottled water or parking up a mobile water tank, known as a bowser, near a home or premises. There are also concerns over water companies’ long-term plans to secure reliable resources over the coming decades. Each supplier is required to draft water resource management plans – updated every five years – to show how they intend to meet needs and simultaneously protect the environment for the following 25 years. The plans set out how to increase supply, including by cutting leakage, developing new reservoirs and promoting water recycling. Draft proposals were submitted over the spring and their final versions are due this autumn. Ofwat has said that competing pressures of population growth and a push to reduce water abstraction means demand needs to be cut while supply is increased. The regulator has expressed concerns over the “level of detail and accuracy” in the documents and said that there was “missing, incomplete and resubmitted data”. Last week, a group of 37 environmental groups, including the WWF and the Angling Trust, wrote to the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, to condemn the draft plans as “woefully inadequate” and deliberately opaque. “Water companies are hiding the truth to avoid criticism and accountability for the state of our nation’s water resources. These plans also rely on large reductions in personal water use,” said James Overington, water policy officer at campaign group WildFish. “We question if people will change their water use if they are being misled about the scale of the problem.” An Anglian Water spokesperson said: “Although parts of our region, in particular Norfolk, remain in ‘drought status’ following last year’s extreme weather conditions, the wet weather we saw in the spring, meant that both our reservoir and groundwater levels have recovered despite seeing a dry start to last winter. On average our reservoirs are around 90% full, groundwaters are around average, and we are currently keeping up with the demand for water during the recent hot weather. “This careful management and significant investment over the last 30 years mean that we’re not currently forecasting any temporary restrictions in water use this year in our region. But, as always, we do urge our customers to continue using water wisely and reuse wherever possible, to ensure there’s enough to go around.” • This article was amended on 19 June 2023 to include a statement from Anglian Water that was received after publication.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a939', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/17/capercaillie-bird-tentative-comeback-scotland', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Dancing Capercaillie bird makes a tentative comeback in Scotland', 'lead': 'Exclusive: Ecologists say there are early signs that the population is recovering in remote forests', 'author': 'Severin Carrell Scotland editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-17 06:00:08', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561188', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/66cf636a028ce07c88a3cfba771ba6995fb88a1b/0_218_3500_2100/500.jpg', 'body': 'It is a discotheque for Britain’s biggest type of grouse. Before dawn, male capercaillie will begin their courtship rituals, their black tail feathers erect and fanning out, chests puffed out, their heads thrust high into the cold spring air. Their dancefloors are forest clearings in the Highlands which echo the males’ wheezing, popping and clattering mating calls. Often perched in surrounding pine trees, hens will carefully watch as their potential mates compete to win their affection. Known as leks, the Old Norse word for play, these meetings are scattered across clearings in pine forests in the Highlands. Many are discreetly monitored each spring by ecologists, who have been increasingly fearful that capercaillie are again heading for extinction in the UK. For the last eight years, capercaillie have been in consistent decline. Last September, Scottish conservationists warned that their population had fallen to just 542, half their number in 2015-16. In many areas where they were once abundant, capercaillie are on the brink of disappearing. But on Speyside in the Cairngorms and in a forest north of Inverness ecologists working for Forestry and Land Scotland, the government agency, believe they have found early signs of recovery. Kenny Kortland, an experienced wildlife ecologist for Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS), said that four of its forest lek counts this year had shown an increase in capercaillie numbers, the first time in recent years. In April and May in Strathspey, the area that includes the forests of Rothiemurchus and Glenmore, FLS detected 58 male capercaillie, an increase on the 52 seen in 2020, with a conservative estimate of 30 hens watching the displays. In Tain, north of Inverness, staff detected 11 males and at least seven hens – the highest number there since 2011. They may be bucking a trend of wholesale retreat across every other capercaillie range save Speyside. Kortland said it made him hopeful numbers would grow next year. “It’s more difficult to count the hens, as they’re often up on the branches or flying around to get the best view of the displaying males,” he said. Hens only appear on the leks for a week. “It’s important to have as many hens as possible because capercaillies don’t pair up, only a few of the males mate with the hens.” Kortland said these findings are particularly satisfying as the forests involved are also heavy in predators, which include birds of prey such as goshawk, pine marten, crows and foxes. That suggests capercaillie can survive in a rich, balanced ecosystem. “The predator community has reassembled,” Kortland said. “Yet capercaillie are able to persist and in fact increase. We may have to accept a lower density of capercaillie but based on the evidence so far, it suggests they can coexist in the presence of predators. So that’s really quite exciting.” It remains unclear whether Kortland’s data will be mirrored by findings from other sites: the Cairngorms capercaillie project, which includes FLS involvement, is due to publish all its lek count figures later this month, which may show a more complex picture. Like other grouse species, capercaillie populations can naturally fluctuate year on year, depending on the impact of spring weather on breeding; on vole populations – if pine martens cannot feed on vole, they switch to capercaillie chicks; or from human disturbance. Cairngorms national park has enforced stricter rules on tourists and local people, with some forest paths shut temporarily or rerouted to protect lekking areas. They have been told to keep their dogs on leads, and to avoid hiking and mountain-biking off designated trails. Deer fences known to kill capercaillie are being stripped out and forests are regenerating naturally. Some landowners, including FLS, use diversionary feeding too to directly feed some predators, reducing the threat to capercaillie. In Perthshire, the Aberdeenshire catchments of Deeside and Donside, in Moray and Nairnshire to the north-east, the populations are in low single figures, putting them on the brink of local extinction. However, Scotland’s aggregated data suggests the total population has stabilised over the last two years. For Scotland’s conservation movement, losing capercaillie would be a humiliation. The current population is the remnant of a reintroduction from Sweden in 1837, the UK’s first, after they were hunted to extinction. In the early 2000s, the Scottish population was estimated to be 2,000. If Kortland’s findings are replicated by other agencies, it may be another indicator that Scotland’s broader rewilding efforts are succeeding. Earlier in June, NatureScot, the government conservation agency, said beavers were now spreading rapidly. It estimates that there are more than 420 beaver territories across Scotland, involving about 1,500 individuals. A decade ago only a few dozen were thought to be in the wild – the result of unlawful and accidental releases from private collections. Several days ago, it emerged that captive-bred wildcats – a native species brought to the edge of extinction in the UK – are now being released into very carefully selected sites in the Cairngorms. “We’re slowly piecing these ecosystems back together,” Kortland said. “The more species we can have, the more robust these ecosystems become.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a93a', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/17/paris-talks-focus-funding-poor-countries-tackle-climate-crisis', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Paris talks to focus on funding poor countries to tackle climate crisis', 'lead': 'World leaders will meet next week to discuss climate finance, green growth, debt and private investment', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-17 06:00:07', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561207', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/fe8e3033432f75ff718eb9454a0a5b5b1573e34a/1994_782_3110_1866/500.jpg', 'body': 'Talks on a global financial pact that will give poor countries access to funds to help them tackle the climate crisis and develop their economies in environmentally sustainable and socially equitable ways will begin next week in Paris. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, will be joined on Thursday by dozens of world leaders to discuss climate finance, green growth, the debt crisis and how to tap private sector sources of investment. EU leaders, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will be there, but the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, has not confirmed whether he will attend. Macron believes current systems of development finance, including overseas aid from rich countries and climate finance to help poor countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather, are not delivering results. “The fight against poverty, the decarbonisation of our economy in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, and the protection of biodiversity, are closely intertwined,” he said, setting out the terms for the two-day summit. “We therefore need to agree together on the best means to address these challenges in the poor and emerging countries of the developing world, when it comes to the amount of investment, to comprehensive reform of infrastructure like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and public and private funds, and how to set a new process in motion.” Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, will also play a leading role. Her proposals, known as the Bridgetown agenda, are aimed at massively expanding the funding available to developing countries, particularly those afflicted by the climate crisis. Mottley has fiercely criticised the World Bank, IMF and similar institutions, most of which were set up in the final days of the second world war, calling them unfit for the 21st-century task of tackling the climate crisis and drawing countries out of debt and poverty. “The international community’s responses are currently fragmented, partial and insufficient,” she said. “We therefore call for a fundamental overhaul.” Calls have been growing from many countries, including the US, the EU and UK, for an overhaul of the World Bank. The former president David Malpass, appointed in 2019 by the then US president, Donald Trump, resigned earlier this year after deepening controversy over his apparently climate-sceptic views. The summit will be the first major international outing for his successor, Ajay Banga. Banga, a former Citigate banker and ex-chief executive of Mastercard, is seen as likely to open the institution to widening partnerships with private investors, and shake up the bank’s attitude to the climate and related crises. But it is not yet known how far he is likely to agree with Mottley’s calls for complete overhaul, including targeting $1tn of new investment in poorer countries, $3tn (£2.35tn) or more for climate finance globally, debt relief for the most indebted nations, and long-term finance over the next 30 years for building resilience to climate impacts. Patrick Verkooijen, the chief executive of the Global Center on Adaptation, said fundamental change was needed, as current systems of overseas aid and development finance were not coping with the crises – of poverty, climate, food supply and biodiversity – facing the world. “We need to shake up the status quo and completely reform much of how development finance has worked in the past. This reimagined and reformed global financial system would suspend debt service repayment when natural disaster strikes whilst also using the balance sheet of multilateral banks to leverage private sector finance to build resilience against climate breakdown,” he said. As the world grapples with severe food shortages, with more than 250 million people facing acute food insecurity, exacerbated by the climate crisis, hunger must also be a key topic at the talks. Alvaro Lario, the president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said: “This summit offers an overdue opportunity to revisit the rules of international finance, which are stacked against the world’s poor, and which ignore their enormous contribution to global food security and global stability. It must find a way to catalyse private sector investment on a massive scale. Public funding alone cannot provide the $330bn to eradicate hunger by 2030.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a93b', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/17/mormon-crickets-nevada', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Bug swarm: Nevada crawling with thick carpet of Mormon crickets', 'lead': 'Millions of crickets – or rather shield-backed katydids – migrating across state, after hatching was delayed in spring', 'author': 'Abené Clayton', 'datePublished': '2023-06-17 05:00:06', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561225', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/b86013b944d4d26475b986661e988ca6accb57a2/0_0_4032_2419/500.jpg', 'body': 'Millions of flightless insects known as Mormon crickets have descended across Nevada, alarming residents, blanketing roadways and buildings, and fueling nightmares. Footage shared on social media and by local news outlets captures six Nevada counties under siege, with thick carpets of bugs moving slowly and efficiently across the state. A local hospital had to deploy brooms and leafblowers to clear the way for patients to get into the building, a spokesperson for the Northeastern Nevada Regional Hospital, told local news outlet KSL. Not only do the bugs make for terrifying plague-like images and videos, they make roadways dangerous when large numbers of them get crushed. “They get run over, two or three come out and eat their buddy, and they get run over, and the roads can get covered with crickets and they can get slick,” Jeff Knight, an entomologist for the Nevada agriculture department, also told KSL. “The bigger issue is these afternoon thunderstorms and put a little water on that and it gets slick, we’ve had a number of accidents caused by crickets.” Despite their name, the insects are not biologically crickets but technically large shield-backed katydids that closely resemble grasshoppers, according to the University of Nevada, Reno. They don’t fly, and instead walk or hop. They lay eggs in the summer, which lie dormant in the winter and then hatch in the spring. But this year, due to an unusually rainy winter, the hatchlings were delayed. The large number of insects moving across Nevada can remain at their peak for four to six years, before being brought back under control by other insects and predators, Knight told the Guardian. “The band of crickets in Elko [Nevada] is probably a thousand acres, and we’ve had bands even bigger than that,” he said. “The drought is probably what triggered them to start hatching. Once they do they have the upper hand, so their populations increase for several years then drop off.” Knight has been treating Nevada’s farmland for Mormon crickets since 1976 and has experienced about 40 outbreaks in that time. He said the high populations of crickets have been moving through Elko and other towns for the past few years. They are not necessarily migrating from one specific place to another, like butterflies do, rather they’re likely looking for more space. “[Population density] is what triggers them to say, ‘There’s too many of us here, we’ve got to start moving.’” Mormon crickets have been a thorn in the side of farmers in the American west for more than a century. They earned the name because swarms of the insects destroyed the fields of Mormon settlers in Utah in the mid-19th century. Since then they have continued to devastate corn, oats, wheat, rye and barley, some of the state’s most profitable crops, according to Utah State University. Since the 1930s, the US agriculture department has been charged with helping states stop grasshoppers and Mormon crickets from destroying rangeland and crops. Western states such as Montana, Utah and Idaho have also spent millions of dollars on suppression. For example, in 2021 Oregon allocated $5m to assess and create one such program, according to the Associated Press.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a93c', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/17/country-diary-we-wind-slowly-upwards-with-our-precious-cargo-of-willow', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: We wind slowly upwards with our precious cargo of willow | Amanda Thomson', 'lead': '<strong>Cairngorms, Scotland: </strong>It’s a hard slog to Loch A’an to help restore a fragile habitat: but it fills us with hope', 'author': 'Amanda Thomson', 'datePublished': '2023-06-17 04:30:04', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561247', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/de7056bf9dd7c1e1e6c62ba43da762c3b2374ced/0_23_2016_1209/500.jpg', 'body': 'At 650 metres, there’s a cool haze and the mountains above and the valley below are bathed in a soft light.

Payne gave a voice to an animal that had hitherto been regarded as dumb – one with a deep register that was, as he described it, a sound as big as the ocean itself. When Payne released whale sounds in 1970 as a vinyl LP, Songs of the Humpback Whale, the album sold 125,000 copies and eventually reached multi-platinum sales. It was followed in 1979 by a flexi-disc of the sounds that was included with 10.5m copies of National Geographic magazine. The effect was akin to Rachel Carson’s groundbreaking book of 1962, Silent Spring. The sounds were strange and otherworldly: they seemed like a lament, a threnody for the animals’ plight. In fact they were a demonstration of another species’ culture: a voice, not a noise. These discrete sounds supplied the album tracks for Songs of the Humpback Whale. The titles – Solo Whale, Slowed-Down Solo Whale, Tower Whales, Distant Whale, Three Whale Trip – reverberated through the alternative culture of the time. “The world is ‘turning on’ to whales,” the liner notes declared. Breaching gloriously on the album’s front cover, the humpback whale became the icon of a new environmental awareness, coinciding with the new images of Earth as a blue planet seen from outer space, and prompting the formation in 1971 of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. Without Payne’s recordings, it has been claimed, there would not have been the political will to implement the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act in the US – although Payne’s colleague Scott McVay noted that the drastically falling populations of over-hunted whales were a more cynical reason for the cessation. Nevertheless, whales had entered pop culture, no longer the fearsome beasts of Moby-Dick. Judy Collins used the sounds in her plaintive recording of the Scottish folk song Farewell to Tarwathie (1970). In 1977 the calls were loaded on to the Voyager probes and sent into outer space. And when David Bowie made love as an alien in Nicolas Roeg’s film The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976), it was to the song of a humpback whale. Payne was born in Manhattan, New York, son of Elizabeth (nee Searle), a music teacher, and Edward Payne, an engineer. As an undergraduate at Harvard University he worked on the directional sensitivity of the ears of bats. In 1960 he married Katharine Boynton, a zoologist. He received a doctorate at Cornell University in 1961 for his studies of owls’ abilities to find prey in the dark, and in 1966 was appointed assistant professor at Rockefeller University, New York, and a research zoologist at the Institute for Research in Animal Behavior, run by the university jointly with the New York Zoological Society. A serious amateur cellist, Payne was attuned to the possibilities of natural “music”. In 1967, intrigued by whale sounds recorded by William Schevill of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Cape Cod, Payne and his wife travelled to Bermuda to hear them for themselves. There they met Dr Frank Watlington of the Palisade Sofar Station, who had chanced on the songs when working for the US Navy on a sonic array designed to monitor the movements of Soviet submarines. Amazed at what he recorded, Watlington had kept his discovery confidential, worried it might be used by whaling fleets to hunt whales. He gave nearly a decade’s worth of audiotapes to the Paynes. Having read McVay’s paper, The Last of the Great Whales, in Scientific American in 1966, the Paynes then shared the tapes with him, and he used his extraordinary expertise with spectrograms to analyse the sounds in visual graphs akin to musical scores. Using a hydrophone (an underwater microphone), the Paynes made many recordings off Bermuda – the model for Shakespeare’s isle of strange noises in The Tempest. Humpback song reverberates through the ocean’s skin; it doesn’t just broadcast below. It is a haunting experience, as the Paynes found. “Far from land, with a faint breeze and a full moon, we heard these lovely sounds pouring out of the sea,” Payne wrote. The Paynes and McVay discovered there were several song types. The songs could last for up to 29 hours and evolved over time, gradually changing each year. In 1971 Payne and McVay published the paper that gave the scientific basis for their work. McVay recalled how he and his wife, Hella, a mathematician, realised that the six octaves were repeated in stanzas, like birdsong. “We drove to the place where the Paynes lived, and laid out the evidence,” McVay recalls. “Roger asked, ‘Are you going to publish this?’ I said yes. He said, ‘Could I publish it with you?’” McVay agreed. “I said ‘Yes, and you can be the senior author, since you seem likely to make this your life.’” Appearing in the journal Science, the report declared that “humpback whales emit a series of surprisingly beautiful sounds”. The mere inclusion of “beauty” in a rigorous study seems now one of the most revolutionary statements Payne and McVay made. Payne went on to have “a very prominent (if largely non-traditional) career as a whale scientist”, the Princeton historian of science D Graham Burnett noted. Hal Whitehead, now a pre-eminent whale scientist, who studied with the Paynes’ “whale laboratory” in the late 70s, described it as an “extraordinarily creative hub”. Payne authored or co-authored dozens of scientific papers, gave hundreds of lectures, made countless television programmes and films, and led 100 oceanic expeditions. As CEO of Ocean Alliance, founded in 1971, he furthered his cause with political agitation. I met him in New Zealand in 2010, with his second wife, the actor Lisa Harrow, whom he had met at a conservation rally in London in 1991 (his first marriage having ended in divorce) and married that year. Over dinner (no animal protein, of course), he seemed to me a charismatic man, still possessed of radical, almost teenage energy in his 70s, not least in his support of Sea Shepherd’s piratical anti-whaling interventions with Japanese whalers. Latterly he lived in rural idyll at South Woodstock, Vermont, where the film-maker Tom Mustill visited him in 2020, describing the encounter in his recent book How to Speak Whale. “I felt I was in the presence of a benevolent wizard,” Mustill said. Payne had embarked on an ambitious new project: the Cetacean Translation Initiative, a coalition of scientists using new technology to interpret what whales might be “saying”. His last public act was to publish a final plea in Time magazine, five days before he died. In it he called for his fellow scientists to “acknowledge the bitter truth” and to “set aside our security … to change all human behaviours that are contributing to the destruction of life, and to change them right down to their deepest roots”. Payne is survived by Lisa, four children, John, Holly, Laura and Sam, from his first marriage, a stepson, Timothy, and 11 grandchildren. • Roger Searle Payne, biologist and environmentalist, born 29 January 1935; died 10 June 2023'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a93e', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/campaigners-win-right-challenge-england-food-strategy-climate-crisis', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Campaigners win right to challenge England’s food strategy over climate crisis', 'lead': 'Feedback argues ministers’ failure to include measures to reduce production of meat and dairy products was unlawful', 'author': 'Damien Gayle', 'datePublished': '2023-06-16 14:10:22', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561296', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/63fcdf3fa2b623f3bf21070859ccf359015993b4/0_115_5121_3073/500.jpg', 'body': 'Ministers broke the law by failing to make plans to cut consumption of meat and dairy in England, activists will argue in a legal challenge after they were granted permission for a full judicial review of the government’s food strategy. Overturning two previous decisions, the court of appeal ruled that the food systems campaigners Feedback could challenge the national food strategy on the basis that it failed to take into account ministers’ duties to cut carbon emissions. The government had argued that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which drafted the strategy, was not bound by the obligations set out in the Climate Change Act 2008. But Lord Justice Lindblom, leading a panel of three judges, said: “We have decided to grant permission to apply for judicial review, having in mind that the case does raise questions of considerable general importance.” The Climate Change Committee has identified substantial reductions in meat and dairy consumption as being essential to tackle the climate emergency. But when the 27-page national food strategy was published 12 months ago it included no specific policies supporting the transition to a low-carbon diet. Feedback began legal action soon after, with a “letter before claim” to Defra. But campaigners were refused permission for a judicial review hearing. At a second oral hearing in December, they were refused again. They were at the high court in London on Friday for a last-ditch attempt to overturn the refusal. A successful legal challenge would force the government to redraft the food strategy to include radical measures to cut Britons’ consumption of animal products. It could also force other government departments, such as the Department for Transport, to put in place policies to reduce emissions to meet carbon budgets. Carina Millstone, Feedback’s chief executive, said she was thrilled at the outcome of the appeal. “We already knew when the food strategy came out it was completely useless and unfit for purpose, for health, food, farming and the climate. Now we know today it may well be illegal as well,” she said. “It’s really high time that the government stops ignoring the advice of its own climate advisers. The Climate Change Committee has been clear that reductions in meat and dairy are a non-negotiable part of all their pathways to net zero. It has called putting in policy measures for this change ‘extremely important’. “So I’m thrilled that today the judges agreed with our analysis that ignoring the advice of climate change advisers may well be illegal, and I hope it marks the beginning of policymakers in government taking action that may well mitigate climate change in food and farming, rather than continuing to hurl us all towards climate catastrophe.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a93f', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/one-of-britains-largest-sunken-forests-reveals-its-secrets-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'One of Britain’s largest sunken forests reveals its secrets', 'lead': 'Pett Level on England’s south coast was once full of oak, elm and ash trees.

Easily missed among the boulders and rock pools, a landscape of gnarled black stumps and enormous fallen tree trunks is revealed and submerged twice a day in a bay between Hastings and Rye. Twisted and smoothed by the tides, the soggy wood is strewn with barnacles and peppered with thousands of holes made by piddocks – burrowing shellfish which have made the logs their home. But this is not just driftwood. These are ancient trees, their stumps still rooted to the spot where they died due to rising sea levels up to 6,500 years ago. The site, at Pett Level in Rye Bay, East Sussex, is one of the UK’s largest sunken forests and would have once formed an extensive area of coastal woodland stretching more than five miles to the east to Rye Harbour and about eight miles to the west, towards Bexhill. Just yards from the witchy burls and branches of the sunken forest, fossilised dinosaur footprints made by iguanodons and ankylosaurus up to 100m years ago can be found in boulders that have fallen from the crumbling cliffs. Today, a tall embankment holds back the sea waters from the acres of reclaimed land that make up Pett Level. But over the millennia, the rising waters that made an island of Britain and a sea out of the river valley that became the Channel, also rose high enough to swamp the forest, killing the trees. Once scarcely studied, the sunken forest is now yielding its secrets to scientists examining how climate breakdown at the end of the last ice age radically altered landscapes and environments as sea levels rose and the climate warmed. Dr Scott Timpany, a paleoecologist at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an expert on sunken forests around Britain, says the ancient wood contained substantial numbers of oak trees at certain points in its history, as well as elm, beech and yew. “These would have been wet woodlands – not like a park woodland. This would have been a pretty boggy, wet environment with pools of water on the surface in places. This would likely have been getting wetter as sea levels rose, as glaciers melted, raising the groundwater table. “The woodland remains we see today are from lots of different periods of time,” he adds. “On the surface of the intertidal zone at the moment, you’ve got oak trees that date from the late Mesolithic all the way through to oak, elm and ash from the middle bronze age. “As you go down the beach you’re effectively stepping back in time.” As recently as 1850, historian William Durrant Cooper wrote that the sunken remains of “Dymsdale Forest” – as it was once known – can only be seen “at low water, during spring tides”. Less than 200 years later, no spring tides are required to see what remains of the woodland. Visitors can wander down to the beach at low tide and poke at the spongy tree trunks, which fell long before Stonehenge or the Giza pyramids were built. As well as the ravages of winter storms, rising sea levels and the interplay of three rivers coming together in Rye, the coast is moulded by longshore drift – the relentless eastwards flow of shingle, the pebbles that define the beaches of much of Britain’s south coast. This is of particular concern to commercial shipping at Rye Harbour. Large container vessels navigate a narrow channel at the mouth of the River Rother, the opening of which would be rapidly blocked by the flow of shingle if left unchecked. Any buildup would also have serious consequences for the reclaimed land at Pett Level, Romney Marsh and the area immediately around Rye. To address this, a concrete arm protecting the entrance to the harbour traps the shingle, and a fleet of tipper trucks remove up to 80,000 tonnes of the pebbles every year, transporting them five miles west to protect the sea wall at Pett Level, in a perpetual battle between the forces of nature and the Environment Agency. “I would estimate that without this effort, within three years the sea would be punching a hole through the sea wall, and all of Pett Level would become saltmarsh,” says Barry Yates, former manager of Rye Harbour nature reserve. The effects of human activity on longshore drift continue to play a significant role in how the coastline changes, and may be a key reason why the sunken forest has become so exposed in recent decades. The creation of a concrete harbour arm in Hastings in the early 20th century cut off much of the eastward flow of shingle. In turn, this reduced the volume of shingle covering the base of the cliffs between Hastings and Pett Level, thereby exposing the cliffs to the sea and increasing the rate of erosion. Yates says: “The cliffs are marching inland as they erode, and it’s the base of the cliffs which dictate where the root of the developing shingle ridge starts. Over time, the cliff has been eaten away, so the starting point of the shingle ridge east of the cliffs has moved northwards and that uncovers all of the peat and the old trees that are there.” Maps of the coastline here at different points over the past few centuries clearly show that whole towns, such as Old Winchelsea, have been lost, and how rivers have substantially rerouted themselves. “We have this sense that everything’s here for ever, but it’s not at all,” says local author Gareth E Rees, whose forthcoming book, Sunken Lands, explores humanity’s long relationship with cataclysmic climate breakdown. “When we look at the sunken forest – at this incredible thing that existed and was powerful, full of life and ancestors and animals and hunters, it disappeared. It’s gone,” says Rees. “We’re also going to have to let things go. There’s a false security in building more and more dykes and barriers. You can’t keep adding engineering solutions.” Yates agrees. “Although we have kept things in place for now by carting shingle up and down, inevitably, the sea and the elements are going to have their way. This bit of coast should be mobile, and the plants and animals have ways of coping with that.” But he says the shifting coastline also serves as a warning. “Most of the ice from the last glaciation has melted, but the last bit that still exists is going to have a huge impact. Most people in the world live at low sea level.

In an interview, Paul Nowak said the UK was “limping towards a green future” and he called for a “national collective effort” involving employers, workers and the government to ensure a quick and fair transition to a net zero economy. “All of our unions are signed up to delivering net zero … from schools to hospitals to the steel industry, our members are working day in, day out to make sure this transition happens and is done in a way that is fair and just,” he said. The role of trade unions in the UK’s net zero transition hit the headlines this month when leader of the GMB, Gary Smith, criticised Labour’s plan to ban oil and gas expansion, saying it was “naive”. Smith said the party had “got it wrong” and that his members had been promised tens of thousands of jobs in renewable energy “time and time again” but that they “simply have not emerged”. Nowak declined to be drawn into the row but said it underlined the need for workers – including those in the oil and gas industry – to have a seat at the table “to shape concrete plans for the future”. He said change “must be done with people rather than to them” if the country was to avoid a rerun of the devastation caused by the deindustrialisation of the 1980s. “Growing up in Merseyside in the 1980s, I saw what happens when you don’t manage industrial transition effectively,” he said. “Right across Britain’s industrial heartlands we can see the scarring effect of long-term unemployment and cities and towns are still recovering. We are absolutely clear that we have to get to net zero in a way that supports and creates good quality jobs and gives people a sense of agency in how that transition can be delivered.” Nowak, who took up the post of general secretary in January, grew up in Merseyside and worked as a call centre operator, a hotel night porter and a supermarket worker before becoming a dedicated trade unionist. He said an ideological aversion to state action meant the current Tory government – unlike its counterparts in the US and Europe – was failing to set out a coherent strategy to decarbonise, instead leaving the issue to fractured, market-led interventions. “I just don’t think you can leave these huge industrial transformations to the market and think everything is just going to work out … We are limping towards a green future rather than having a government with a real sense of purpose,” he said. Pressure for action on the climate in the UK in recent years has come from direct action campaigns, protests and youth strikes – from Extinction Rebellion to Just Stop Oil. In recent months, some trade unions have made common cause with climate campaigners, with both groups arguing that the cost of living crisis and ecological breakdown have the same root cause – an economic system that exploits natural resources and people for the benefit of a wealthy few. Nowak said unions “can and do work together” with climate campaigners, with both groups prioritising “a positive long-term future for everyone” over short-term private profits for a few. But he acknowledged there were differences of politics and outlook between the two, with “union activity focused on the workplace”. “Our credibility is rooted in those millions of union members whose work will be affected by the transition to net zero,” he said. “So constructive dialogue between us is important where we have differing views from some climate campaigners, such as our view that there is an important future role for nuclear energy.” Nowak is confident that the trade union movement has the capacity and expertise to ensure a just transition – if workers are given a seat at the table from the start. “This is as transformational as the railways or electricity – not just for energy intensive industries but for every sector from public to private … But in the 150 years of our history we have overseen huge change and transition and we have the ability to do the same again this time.” The TUC has appointed two new project officers for worker-led transitions to net zero – one in the steel industry and the other in motor manufacturing. Nowak said the drive to net zero could not be at the expense of the UK’s industrial base and said overseeing the decarbonisation of energy intensive industries such as steel, ceramics and chemicals was as important as ensuring good jobs in the newer industries such as solar and wind. “It is about making sure our members have good, secure jobs not just next year or in five years’ time but in 15, 20 years’ time – our members know that the jobs they will be doing and their kids will be doing will be shaped by what we do in the here and now.” Nowak said anti-union laws and a culture among employers of keeping trade unions and workers at arms length were making it difficult to organise in the fast-growing wind and solar industries. But he said there were signs that Labour was developing a more coherent net zero strategy, linking a new deal for workers to trade policies and industrial strategy. Starmer is expected to make highly skilled green jobs a central plank of his clean energy pitch later this month, though Labour has been criticised for scaling back plans to borrow £28bn a year to invest in the transition. Nowak said a successful transition could not be cooked up by politicians in Westminster or business leaders in boardrooms – or even trade union leaders in endless meetings. “This is not about me or the TUC or a few union leaders. What trade unions bring to the table is a network of tens of thousands of union reps up down the country that can be actively mobilised to help shape what this green future will look like,” he said. “That is a resource that no government should ignore and no employer should ignore.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a941', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/roger-payne-60-years-discovery-of-whale-song-their-haunting-sounds-reveal-new-secrets', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Almost 60 years after the discovery of whale song, their haunting sounds reveal new secrets', 'lead': 'In 1967, Roger Payne, who has died at 88, noticed that the mammals’ calls were organised in repeating patterns, spurring the discovery of whale song', 'author': 'Sophy Grimshaw', 'datePublished': '2023-06-16 05:00:36', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561354', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e003a3a3c136469a78713cea5e52a4184f1d4e06/233_951_4645_2787/500.jpg', 'body': 'The idea that whales “sing”, commonly accepted today, is relatively recent. Until the late 1960s it was thought that whale noises were nothing more than expressive sounds or calls. But in 1967, a discovery by the marine biologist Roger Payne, who died last Saturday, changed our understanding – ushering in a new way of looking at the world’s largest mammals. As the young Payne listened on repeat for days to recordings made of humpback sounds captured underwater off the coast of Bermuda, he noticed the calls were organised in repeating patterns. Speaking to Guardian Seascape in 2020, he described it as his “wow” moment, spurring on the discovery – made alongside other researchers – that all whale species “sing” in some rhythmic form, even in the “clicks” of toothed whales, such as sperm whales. Some whales even use the sonata form, common to human music: a theme, followed by a variation, then a return to the theme. The zoologist Katy Payne – Roger’s collaborator (and former wife) – would go on to prove that whales use what can be described as rhyme, a technique whales seem to use to remember long and complex sections of repeating patterns, topped and tailed with “end phrases”. Katy Payne showed humpback whales in a given area sing different versions of the same song – essentially a “hit” – that changes slightly throughout the course of the season. Indeed, it was the humpback – toothless baleen whales, with fleshy, concertina-like jaws – that quickly stood out as the most prolific cetacean singer, creating songs that are also emotionally affecting to human beings. Why whales sing is still not comprehensively clear, but Roger Payne soon observed differences between their songs and their other social sounds: for example, between the “almost whispering” tone of mothers communicating to calves, and the long, loud broadcasts of males seeking a mate. It is primarily males that sing songs, though there are some recordings of females singing, too. The role of whale song in mating is still not fully understood. In 2020 Stanford University researchers found that blue whales sing at different times of day and night as their migration behaviour changes – though, again, precisely why is unclear. What is known is that, given the distances whales travel in deep ocean, the volume and “broadcast” quality of song is key. Roger Payne’s assertion, early in his career, that a blue whale, in deep ocean free from human noise pollution, could transmit a song that might be heard by another whale as far as 13,000 miles away, was so controversial among biologists that he described the reaction as almost “career-ending”. Another theory of his was that music might predate human life, given that whales predate humans in evolutionary terms. In his later years, Payne became interested in how technology might help to decipher a vocabulary of “whale speak”, if enough samples could be gathered – though he stopped short of using the term “language” as it was too open to being misconstrued.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a942', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/action-to-tackle-air-pollution-failing-to-keep-up-with-research', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Action to tackle air pollution failing to keep up with research', 'lead': 'Globally, outdoor air pollution is second only to tobacco as greatest cause of lung and respiratory cancers', 'author': 'Gary Fuller', 'datePublished': '2023-06-16 05:00:36', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561372', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/68eeaf1d0f9c88836dde45cde7f0ad723f83bd2b/0_0_5555_3334/500.jpg', 'body': 'This year marks a decade since the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) gathered in Lyon, France, to unanimously declare that air pollution caused cancer in humans. Air pollution was classified as a type 1 carcinogen, the most certain category possible. This was mainly based on more than 20 years of research in particle pollution and lung cancer. The number of research studies has almost doubled since the IARC meeting in Lyon, with even more evidence on lung cancer in never-smokers, but governmental action to reduce air pollution has not kept up. Globally, outdoor air pollution is second only to tobacco as the greatest cause of lung and respiratory cancers. This holds true in almost all parts of the world, with a notable exception of low-income countries where people (especially women and children) also breathe smoke in their homes from cooking on open fires. In the past 10 years new studies have linked air pollution to other cancers, including breast and bladder cancer. These have also been associated with nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant from diesel traffic that is being targeted by low emissions zones in many cities. There is emerging evidence of links to childhood leukaemia too. For those people with lung cancer, smokers and never-smokers, their prognosis and survival appears to be reduced if they live in a polluted area. Research includes a recent study of more than a quarter of a million people with lung cancer in Pennsylvania. This raises questions about the impact of air pollution on the way that cancer progresses and how it may change the effectiveness of chemotherapy. In 2020, Dr Michelle Turner of ISGlobal, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, led a review of evidence on cancer and air pollution. She said: “Actions to reduce outdoor air pollution will reduce lung cancer in both smokers and in non-smokers. They may also improve survival from lung cancer, especially in those diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease. A study from the UK’s Francis Crick Institute found that living for three years in an area of higher particle pollution might be sufficient to promote growth of EGFR-driven lung cancer, a type of cancer common in never- and light-smokers.” Across the UK, about 3,500 cancer deaths were attributed to air pollution in 2015. These are not spread evenly. Air pollution affects us all, but some communities are affected more than others. Greatest concentrations are often found in the poorest communities and also in areas with the highest proportion of black, Asian and multiple ethnicities. Turner explained: “Recent studies have shown stronger associations of ambient air pollution and lung cancer risk in lower-socioeconomic neighbourhoods where there are higher air pollution levels. There is an urgent worldwide need for multiple, multi-level public health and policy interventions to improve outdoor air for lung cancer prevention and to reduce disparities in the disease”. Last year the UK set a target to reduce the worst PM2.5 particle pollution in England to 10 micrograms per cubic metre by 2040. The EU is discussing a proposal to meet this target by 2030. This is double the World Health Organization guideline. Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, from the University of Southampton, said: “Air pollution increases the risk of lung and other types of cancer including breast, liver and pancreas. Overall, the American Cancer Association for Cancer Research states that for every 10 micrograms per cubic of increased exposure to PM2.5, the risk of dying from any cancer rises by 22%.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a943', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/country-diary-a-female-goosander-is-left-to-defend-her-ducklings-alone', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: A female goosander mother is left to defend her ducklings alone | Phil Gates', 'lead': '<strong>St John’s Chapel, Weardale:</strong> Unlike migrating drakes, females like this one can’t simply fly off when we approach her brood on the river', 'author': 'Phil Gates', 'datePublished': '2023-06-16 04:30:35', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561390', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/1d85ec99d51b0866d414524c4abb88a91633e071/0_104_1559_936/500.jpg', 'body': 'Outside the breeding season, goosanders are usually wary birds, liable to take flight at the first inkling of an approaching human threat.

Back in the 1980s, it was proven that British goosander drakes, identified by tags and coloured dyes, undertake a long summer moulting migration to Scandinavia. He would have left the nest as soon as she began to incubate eggs, more than a month ago, and may now be loafing around in the Tanafjord in Norway, in the company of 35,000 others from western Europe, moulting out of their dapper bottle green, pink and white breeding plumage into drabber feathers. With luck, he’ll be back in November to father some more ducklings. Why fly so far to moult? Goosanders only colonised Scotland in the 1870s, spreading into the border county rivers and northern England 50 years ago. The drakes’ long summer migration might be a legacy of their earlier, more restricted continental distribution. As for the females, there’s not enough time to join their consorts in Scandinavia after they’ve raised their ducklings here, so they stay on our rivers to moult in winter eclipse plumage. We left our single-parent goosander in peace, crossing the bridge quickly so that she and her flotilla could pass underneath. With danger gone, the family white-water rafted between the boulders, bobbing downriver towards calmer waters. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a944', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/just-stop-oil-protesters-glyndebourne-opera-festival', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Just Stop Oil protesters interrupt opera at Glyndebourne festival', 'lead': 'Three activists use glitter cannons and air horns during performance of Poulenc’s Dialogues des Carmélites', 'author': 'Nadeem Badshah', 'datePublished': '2023-06-15 20:01:29', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561427', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/554775162d9adbccec8bedadb495c0f73bf5e465/0_215_768_461/500.jpg', 'body': 'Just Stop Oil protesters have interrupted a performance during the Glyndebourne opera festival in East Sussex by letting off glitter cannons and blowing air horns. The disruption took place during a performance on Thursday of Francis Poulenc’s Dialogues des Carmélites at the festival near Lewes.

A Glyndebourne spokesperson said the incident was formally reported to police but officers were not on site and no arrests had been made.

Take action with Just Stop Oil.” Earlier on Thursday, more than a dozen Just Stop Oil protesters were arrested during slow marches through London as new legislation came into force giving police officers greater powers to intervene and prevent disruption. Fifty-four supporters, across four groups, marched on the A406 at Hanger Lane, west London, and at Battersea Bridge in south London. Nine of the activists were arrested by police after refusing to comply with a section 12 order, which places conditions on protests if they are deemed to be causing “serious disruption”.

The move by the UN to require anyone registering for the summit to declare their affiliation was heralded as a victory for transparency by campaigners who have been increasingly concerned at the growing presence of oil and gas lobbyists at climate talks. Scott Kirby, a campaigner from Youngo, which represents youth campaigners at the UN climate talks, said: “When young people see the number of fossil fuel lobbyists present at UN Framework Convention on Climate Change conferences, it makes us question the ability this process has to solve the biggest challenge threatening our futures. This is why we welcome the step to increase transparency of observer interests in the talks.” Many campaigners said the change to make potential conflicts of interest more apparent should be only a first step towards excluding fossil fuel companies from the talks, or from key parts of them. Hwei Mian Lim, of the Women and Gender Constituency, said: “We can only meaningfully tackle the climate crisis when we kick big polluters out. Fortunately, we have the real solutions, including gender-just climate solutions, and have the power in collective feminist movements to prevent untold suffering, in particular among women and girls in the global south. “This is strengthened with weeding out the undue influence of big polluters that seek to undermine climate action. Cop28 is our best chance to start implementing them and we must do so in the most gender responsive, and effective and impactful way.” The change came as nations wrapped up nearly two weeks of talks in Bonn, where officials tried to lay the groundwork for Cop28, which starts on 30 November. The event will be held in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer, and chaired by Sultan Al Jaber, who is head of the UAE national oil company, Adnoc. The company is planning a large expansion of its production capacity, and last year it sent scores of executives to the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt. Al Jaber attended the Bonn talks for two days last week and spoke only briefly in public. He said: “The phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable. The speed at which this happens depends on how quickly we can phase up zero-carbon alternatives, while ensuring energy security, accessibility and affordability.” He failed to give an assurance that a phase-out of fossil fuels would be on the official agenda at Cop28, despite a concerted push by many developed and developing countries for its inclusion. The UAE Cop28 presidency has insisted it is up to all the countries represented at the talks to make decisions on the agenda. Progress was slow at the Bonn talks, where countries had been hoping to clear away minor technical issues so heads of government could come to Cop28 to make the bold political decisions needed to put the world on track to meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Officials could not even agree an agenda for these preliminary talks. For most of the fortnight, the adoption of an official plan for the Bonn talks was delayed by an impasse between developing countries, which are frustrated that promised financial assistance has not been forthcoming, and rich nations that wanted the focus to be on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, put the blame squarely on rich governments. “The Bonn climate conference laid bare the glaring hypocrisy of wealthy nations, showcasing a remarkable indifference to the struggles of developing countries,” he said. “Let’s be clear: without honouring their financial pledges – directly tied to their historical role in driving the climate crisis – these affluent nations lack the moral authority to exert pressure on poorer countries. Developing nations face the monumental task of eradicating poverty, fostering green development, and coping with escalating climate disasters. They deserve unwavering support, not undue pressure.” Eventually, with only a day’s negotiations left, the impasse was resolved so that progress made during the talks could be officially recognised. Poor countries are hoping for further progress on climate finance from a conference expected to be attended by more than 50 world leaders in Paris next week, hosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Reform of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions will be on the agenda, and countries will be expected to come forward with new ideas on how to mobilise the trillions needed for developing countries to shift their economies to a low-carbon footing and prepare for the impacts of the climate crisis. Left unresolved at Bonn was the question of which country would host next year’s summit, Cop29. It is the turn of the eastern group, which comprises Russia and former eastern bloc countries in Europe and central Asia. Tensions over the Ukraine war have riven the group, and within eastern European countries there are rivalries and feuds. Bulgaria is one candidate, but a highly placed European source told the Guardian that the country’s delegation had failed to attend EU coordination meetings at Cop27. The controversy looks unlikely to be resolved soon, and a decision could be put off to the end of Cop28.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a947', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/wildcats-to-be-released-secret-scottish-sites-effort-avoid-extinction', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Wildcats to be released in secret Scottish sites in effort to avoid extinction', 'lead': 'Animals to be introduced during next three years but ecologists say they still face survival challenges', 'author': 'Severin Carrell Scotland editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-15 16:47:09', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561485', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/1f98b1171cfbfd4416811edf4fe0301b8ebfd754/0_629_2615_1569/500.jpg', 'body': 'About 20 specially bred wildcats are being released at secret locations in the Scottish Highlands by conservationists hoping to save the species from extinction in the UK. The animals were raised in captivity at a wildlife park in the Cairngorms as part of a breeding programme run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which is expected to release up to 60 cats into the wild over the next three years. It is the first time a predatory mammal such as the wildcat has been officially released in the UK, and if successful will increase calls for Eurasian lynx to be introduced in Scotland – more than 1,000 years after they were hunted to extinction. The captive breeding programme was set up after Scotland’s wildcat population was on the cusp of being declared genetically extinct in the wild in 2019 because of habitat loss and interbreeding with feral domestic cats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature said the wild population was “no longer viable”. It estimated as few as 30 were living in the wild in Scotland. “The number of wildcats is too small, the hybridisation too far advanced and the population too fragmented,” it said. Although the cats, which feed on mice, voles and rabbit, have been carefully acclimatised using animals raised in captivity in the Cairngorms, ecologists still worry they face major survival challenges. Local people including gamekeepers, who may fear wildcats could eat grouse and pheasant chicks, have been educated about wildcat living habits. The project has also heavily monitored feral and domestic cats in the release area, with 100 camera traps locating cats, which are then trapped and if necessary vaccinated and neutered to avoid hybridisation with wildcats. The wildcats have been released in the Cairngorms national park wearing satellite tracking collars so they can be carefully monitored and supervised. Dr Helen Senn, the project leader and head of science and conservation programmes for the RZSS, said that eventually wildcats raised or trapped on mainland Europe could be included in the release scheme. “We hope that this project will pave the way for the full recovery of Scotland’s last remaining native cat species,” she said. “Unfortunately, life is tough for wild carnivores and the sad reality is that some of the wildcats that we release will not survive due to threats such as road traffic. Their survival is contingent on their individual behaviour in a new environment. “However, we also know that inaction will result in extinction. As human activity is responsible for the wildcat’s decline, we have a responsibility to take action now to protect one of our rarest and most threatened mammals.” Francesca Osowska, the chief executive of NatureScot, the government conservation agency, said the project sat within a wider mosaic of species reintroduction and rewilding projects. “A huge amount of work has laid the ground for these wildcat releases, and we’re proud to have played our part in that. Our research shows that wildcats are facing extinction in Scotland, which makes conservation translocations like this a vital tool for the species’ recovery,” she said. “The newly released wildcats will face significant challenges as they seek to establish themselves, so it’s crucial we continue to do everything we can to give them the best chance to survive, and thrive, in Scotland.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a948', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/kent-water-shortages-school-closures', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Four schools in East Sussex forced to close due to water shortages', 'lead': 'Criticism of South East Water mounts as local people accuse it of failing to invest in infrastructure', 'author': 'Sandra Laville', 'datePublished': '2023-06-15 13:30:44', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561503', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e2860a51a8904bd78aadf10b341ccd7a7247fd1c/0_405_6042_3625/500.jpg', 'body': 'Four schools in East Sussex have been closed because of water shortages across the area as criticism of South East Water mounts. The company was communicating with customers in the affected areas by text message, according to some residents in Wadhurst. Three primary schools and one secondary school that had been forced to shut earlier in the week remained closed, East Sussex county council said. Across Kent – also served by South East Water – shortages also continued. In Tunbridge Wells, the situation was exacerbated by a water leak on Wednesday that could take up to six days to repair, according to notices posted at the site on Hall’s Hole Road in the town. East Sussex council said there had been no warning on Thursday for teachers at Harbour primary school in Newhaven over the continued lack of water or when it would be available again, so they decided to close the school. “Teachers arrived in the morning to find there was no running water. There was no information about this on the South East Water website,” the council said. “We communicated this to parents and they were told we would give them an update at 10am. In the meantime, South East Water said that we should have water by 1.30pm so a decision was made to keep the school closed for the day.” At Rotherfield primary school, water pressure was too low to open and the children remained at home, and the Beacon academy in Crowborough said its sixth form site was affected by loss of water and the school was partially closed. Wadhurst primary school was closed on Thursday for the third day this week owing to water shortages. The acute water shortages come as Met Office data shows there was significantly above average rainfall in east Sussex and Kent in April. Simon Partridge, a senior forecaster, said 83.9mm of rain had fallen in east Sussex in April, which was 60% above average. In Kent rainfall was 84mm in April, 85% above average. May has, however, been a much drier month, with rainfall 45% below average in both areas. South East Water, which is majority owned by Australian and Canadian private equity funds, was accused by some local people of failing to invest in infrastructure as water leaks continued in villages where customers were facing little or no water supply. The privatised company has paid dividends to shareholders in the last two years of £156m, and paid £76m in interest payments on loans, according to data from David Hall, a visiting professor of Public Services International Research Unit at the University of Greenwich. Linda Valins, 71, who lives in Wadhurst, has had little or no water since Monday. She said the water company was communicating with her by generic text messages. “It is across the area, we either have no water, nothing coming out of the taps, or the pressure is so low we are unable to get hot water. The schools are closed, they are leaving bottles of water at places across the area. “We are struggling without the use of flushing our loos, drinking water from our taps, hot water to shower in and clean our homes. Residents here are often elderly and cannot get to the bottled water stations as they have no transport. “South East Water’s only mode of communication is via a text to me daily with the same words and pushing the completion date of repairs up 24 hours every single day. “We have no end date in sight and things are tough. Worse still, we know the shareholders’ dividends are huge and are not being spent on infrastructure, pipes, and repairing the multitude of leaks across this area.” South East Water blamed customers for the water shortages. “We are continuing to see very high demand for water in Kent and Sussex. Yesterday [Wednesday] we produced 654 megalitres of tapwater, when the usual figure is 540,” said Steve Andrews, the company’s incident manager. “All our water treatment works and water sources available to us are being used, but with the demand still so high, our treated water storage reservoirs are not refilling enough to keep all our customers in supply. “This means up to 2,500 customers, mainly in the Wadhurst area, may be without water or have low pressure.” The company said it was working with schools to try to get alternative water to them and had set up bottled water collection stations. “Customers on our priority services register are receiving deliveries of bottled water from our customer care team,” it said. “We are doing everything we can, including moving water around our network. However, we are continuing to ask customers who do have tap water supplies to only use it for essential tasks such as hygiene, hydration and cooking. Please don’t use hosepipes and sprinklers as this drains the system very quickly.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a949', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/vast-fossil-fuel-and-farming-subsidies-causing-environmental-havoc-world-bank', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Vast fossil fuel and farming subsidies causing ‘environmental havoc’', 'lead': 'World Bank says subsidies costing as much as $23m a minute must be repurposed to fight climate crisis', 'author': 'Damian Carrington Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-15 13:00:16', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561521', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d04e0aa16f8e4d360b847ce6c77a92de4d110bc0/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg', 'body': 'Trillions of dollars of subsidies for fossil fuels, farming and fishing are causing “environmental havoc”, according to the World Bank, severely harming people and the planet. Many countries spend more on the harmful subsidies than they do on health, education or poverty reduction, the bank says, and the subsidies are entrenched and hard to reform as the greatest beneficiaries tend to be rich and powerful. Reforming subsidies would provide vital funding to fight the climate and nature crises at a time when public coffers are severely stretched, the bank says. The “toxic” subsidies total at least $7.25tn a year, according to a major new report from the bank. The explicit subsidies – money spent by governments – account for about $1.25tn a year, or more than $2m a minute. Most of these are harmful, the bank says. There are also implicit subsidies such as waived taxes and the cost of the damage caused by worsenening global heating and air pollution. These total $6tn a year, according to the World Bank, although a higher recent estimate that includes the costs of pollution and destruction of nature by farming pushes the figure to almost $11tn a year. In total, the subsidies supporting environmental destruction could amount to $23m a minute. The bank said the estimates were conservative, as some countries did not fully record subsidies and they had risen since the Covid pandemic and had yet to be fully counted. The bank also said the bulk of the subsidies were regressive, benefiting the rich more than the poor, and that direct aid to the poorest would be far more efficient. “Environmentally harmful subsidies [are] one of the most toxic aspects of development that we have in the world,” said Richard Damania, the World Bank chief economist for sustainable development. “These are trillions that we are throwing away, trillions that are doing harm. And yet we need that money.” “There’s something really quite strange about subsidising fossil fuels on the one hand, while we spend money to fight climate change on the other hand,” he said. At $577bn, the explicit subsidies for coal, oil and gas in 2021 were twice as large as those for renewable energy, and almost six times higher than the climate finance promised by rich countries to developing nations. In 2021, UN agencies reported that almost 90% of agricultural subsidies harmed people’s health and the climate, and drove inequality, while the IMF found that trillions of dollars of fossil fuel subsidies were “adding fuel to the fire” of the climate crisis at a time when rapid cuts in carbon emissions were needed. The World Bank report, titled Detox Development, says the subsidies are “driving the degradation of the world’s foundational natural assets – clean air, land, and oceans – [which] are critical for human health and nutrition”. Fossil fuels are “vastly underpriced”, the report says, while subsidy reforms “save lives”. Pollution from fossil fuels causes 8.7m deaths a year, according to a 2021 study, one in five of all deaths globally. Subsidies for agriculture are “unequal and unwise”, the report says. “Not only do these subsidies promote inefficiencies, but they also cause much environmental havoc.” The report found that subsidised fertiliser caused so much overuse in some regions that it reduced crop yields, while also causing huge nitrogen pollution. It also found farm subsidies were responsible for the destruction of 2.2m hectares (5.4m acres) of forest a year, about 14% of global deforestation, which leads to almost 4m extra cases of malaria a year. Fishing subsidies amount to about $118bn a year and are a key factor in over-exploitation of marine life, which has sent the oceans into “a collective state of crisis”, according to the report. The report says government subsidies today make up an “enormous share of public budgets worldwide, perhaps larger than at any point in human history”. “Subsidy reform is extremely urgent – in fact it is essential – if we are to safeguard both people and planet,” said Morgan Gillespy, at the Food and Land Use Coalition. “The report makes a significant contribution to the conversation on agricultural subsidies. Repurposing inefficient and unsustainable subsidy spending is the most cost-effective and economically attractive way to achieve global climate and nature goals.” Ipek Gençsü, at the ODI global affairs thinktank, said: “Government fossil fuel subsidies have ballooned due to the energy price crisis, at a time when governments should instead be providing financing to increase energy efficiency and to invest in clean technologies. Instead, they have locked consumers and the society further into fossil fuel addiction.” The report acknowledges that cutting subsidies is politically difficult and presents a roadmap for successful reform. Communication is key, it says, to build coalitions of support Compensation is also critical. “There will always be losers,” said Damania. “But compensation is an excellent way of putting money directly into the hands of poor people, rather than indirectly through some subsidy.” Lastly, reforms must be credible, he said; people must be convinced that governments will stay the course and not be pressured into reversals. Higher levels of debt in many countries after the Covid pandemic and global economic problems resulting from the war in Ukraine and other factors meant subsidy reform could be a vital source of funding for environmental action, Damania said. “We have to find ways of spending the money that we have better, rather than arguing that we need to spend more when budgets are so tight. Look how close we are to so many planetary boundaries.” The report says: “Although doing so will entail demanding policy reforms, the costs of inaction will be far higher.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a94a', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/lab-grown-fish-finless-foods', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Down to Earth: Is this lab-grown fish the future of seafood?

Sign up here to read more exclusive pieces like this and for a digest of the week’s biggest environment stories every Thursday As I fumbled with my chopsticks, I could feel the eyes of the four executives circled around me watching closely. Seated at the head of the table in a room tucked between a commercial kitchen and a laboratory, I had just been treated to a tour of the Finless Foods facility in San Francisco – and this was the finale. Positioned on a plate before me were four beautifully presented pieces of high-grade nigiri with all the expected extras. Two were made from wild-caught bluefin tuna; two were unreleased prototypes grown from cell cultures in their lab. I was among only a few people outside the company given the chance to try the results of years of research and experimentation – and millions of dollars of investment – into what Finless hopes will become the future for sustainable seafood. Now in the final stages before submitting its prototype to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Finless is in position to achieve regulatory approval in 2024. Created from a 51-49% mix of cells grown in its lab and a proprietary blend of plant-based materials that help achieve a similar look, feel, smell, taste and nutrient profile between its fish and those caught from the sea, the company is also on track to be the first to offer cell-cultured bluefin to US consumers. Despite years of conservationist messaging, demand continues to grow for the melt-in-your mouth delicacy – called “essential to sushi” by chef Mark Okuda in an LA Times feature on the pitfalls of bluefin consumption. By 2016, the Pacific bluefin tuna population was roughly 2.6% of its original size. In recent years, bluefin stock around the globe have bounced back from the brink but the species remains in peril from overfishing. “We are reaching carrying capacity,” Shannon Cosentino-Roush, the chief strategy officer at Finless, told me of the plight faced by this fish and the ecosystems around it, adding: “There’s no end in sight in demand decreasing.” “Getting the cells to do what you want and the nutrient mixes super inexpensive — it is a challenge,” said chief innovation officer and co-founder Brian Wyrwas, over the hum machinery inside the lab. Feeding the cells a nutrient mix, the team has been able to not only get them to grow and thrive as they might have inside a fish but also change into muscle and fat. There’s hope at the company that, in the near future, Finless will be able to offer a product fully comprised of cultured cells. For now, the focus is on getting a prototype through the roughly year-long regulatory process and on to plates across the US. Then, the rest of the world. Last year, Upside Foods, another cultivated meat company, got the first FDA approval for its chicken, an achievement celebrated across the burgeoning industry. Still, key challenges remain. Even with regulators on board, a suspicious public will have to be convinced. Questions remain around the scalability of foods grown in labs and whether they can be both a sustainable and affordable alternative to eating meat the old-fashioned way. There is already some preliminary data that suggests the cultivated meat industry’s promise of a less-environmentally harmful product may fall short. One recent analysis found that the way cultivated beef products are produced could exact an even higher toll on the environment than retail beef if brought to scale. But for Finless, the point has always been to create a way for consumers to enjoy fish without the fish, and they say they are committed to doing so sustainably. “I have seen a lot of tech being correctly exposed for bad work being done,” Selden told me. “I hope people don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. We are doing a real thing, there are real people here who genuinely care, and who are actually doing something that will help if the world lets us.” The final test, of course, comes down to taste. I had finally wrangled my cell-cultivated nigiri between two chopsticks, skipped the soy sauce dunk, and went all in. The texture wasn’t an exact match but the flavour was impressive to my admittedly unrefined palate. Most of all, I was distracted by the excitement of being offered a taste of the future and the hope of one-day enjoying foods without a side of guilt. There are still questions that need answers, but, as Finless CTO Brandon Chen put it: “This is happening sooner than [anyone] anticipated. The future is now.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a94c', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/record-temperatures-global-heating', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Fears of hottest year on record as global temperatures spike', 'lead': 'Early data shows June temperatures hitting record highs ahead of El Niño that experts say will have significant heating effect', 'author': 'Oliver Milman', 'datePublished': '2023-06-15 07:30:26', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561575', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/f3c1cb38606b5b9c71dfbbb80ff305bd582249e1/0_200_6000_3600/500.jpg', 'body': 'Global temperatures have accelerated to record-setting levels this month, an ominous sign in the climate crisis ahead of a gathering El Niño that could potentially propel 2023 to become the hottest year ever recorded.

There has been “remarkable global warmth” so far in June, confirmed Copernicus, the European Union’s Earth observation arm, which said that the first few days of the month even breached a 1.5C increase compared with pre-industrial times.

The long-term warming conditions caused by the burning of fossil fuels will probably receive a further pulse of heat via El Niño, a naturally recurring phenomenon where sections of the Pacific Ocean heat up, typically causing temperatures to spike across the world. Last week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said El Niño conditions are now present and will “gradually strengthen” into early next year. Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, said human-caused warming will be exacerbated by an event that typically adds between 0.1C to 0.2C (0.18F to 0.36F) to the overall global temperature. “The global surface temperature anomaly is at or near record levels right now, and 2023 will almost certainly be the warmest year on record,” said Mann. “That is likely to be true for just about every El Niño year in the future as well, as long as we continue to warm the planet with fossil fuel burning and carbon pollution.” Mika Rantanen, a Finnish meteorologist, said that the spiking heat so far this month was “extraordinary” and that it was “pretty certain” it would result in a record warm June. This year has already seen severe, record heatwaves roil places from Puerto Rico to Siberia to Spain, while blistering heat in Canada helped spur huge wildfires that blotted the skies above New York City and Washington with toxic smoke last week. According to an update issued by Noaa on Wednesday, the world had its third warmest May in a 174-year temperature record last month, with North America and South America both having their hottest May ever recorded. Noaa is more circumspect about the prospects of an annual heat record in 2023, placing the odds at about 12%, but has said it is almost certain the year will rank in the top 10 warmest and is very likely to be in the top five. In May, the World Meteorological Organization warned that global temperatures will probably soar over the next five years, fueled by El Niño as well as emissions, with a new record hot year almost guaranteed during this period. There is also a good chance the average temperature will exceed 1.5C (2.7F) beyond pre-industrial times, a key threshold agreed by governments at which point heatwaves, droughts, flooding and other climate impacts become significantly worse. While people are feeling the heat on land, an even more remarkable burst of warmth is occurring in the seas, with Noaa confirming a second consecutive month of record high ocean surface temperatures in May. Excess heat in the oceans, which cover 70% of the globe’s surface, influences overall global temperatures, as well as warping fish populations, bleaching coral reefs and driving coastal sea level rises. “The oceans have been warming steadily but we are now seeing record temperatures which is certainly alarming given we are expecting El Niño to strengthen,” said Ellen Bartow-Gillies, a climate scientist at Noaa. “That will undoubtedly have an impact on the rest of the world.” Bartow-Gillies said Noaa had not yet processed its temperature data for June but that it appeared the elevated heat will continue this month, although El Niño will not be a major factor until later in the year. “We are off to a pretty warm start to the year, it’s not unprecedented, but we could be getting even warmer due to El Niño,” she said. Regardless of whether 2023 ends up the hottest ever recorded, scientists caution that the escalating impacts of the climate crisis are now starkly evident and will not be slowed until greenhouse gas emissions are radically cut. “Without stronger emission cuts, the changes we are seeing are just the start of the adverse impacts we can expect to see,” said Natalie Mahowald, an atmospheric scientist at Cornell University. “This year and the extreme events we have seen so far should serve as a warning.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a94d', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/country-diary-the-may-blossom-has-been-spectacular-this-year', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: The may blossom has been spectacular this year | Virginia Spiers', 'lead': '<strong>St Dominic, Tamar Valley:</strong> I am out early to complete fixings of new nets on the fruit cage, hoping for rain to swell gooseberries, currants and raspberries', 'author': 'Virginia Spiers', 'datePublished': '2023-06-15 04:30:23', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561593', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/17e7fe66b8f9fb6da89008ead68778a1abbd6b56/0_8_1280_768/500.jpg', 'body': 'The may blossom has been particularly spectacular and long-lasting this summer, with swags of flowers (mostly white, some pink) overhanging hedgebanks beside narrow lanes and around little fields below Hingston Down.

A swarm of bees flew in before the end of May and took over an inaccessible space in the barn roof.

Holly has shed flower clusters, tall sycamores dangle lime-green racemes, and the purple and mauve petals on the Judas tree and wisteria have faded. Dogwoods (seeded from an old tree established before we came here, almost 50 years ago) now show flowers with creamy bracts, like the brooch sent to my grandmother by her sister, who worked on Vancouver Island. Come evening, the drying north-easterly breeze continues to rustle leaves and mast on the nearby landmark clump of beech. Evening sun sifts through laneside ferns with campions, sorrel, foxgloves, seeding stitchwort and bluebells, all entwined with tendrils of bryony and goosegrass. Adjoining fields show a variety of pasture usage – those already cut and harvested need rain for further growth, as does a dusty pasture ranged over by sheep. A rare uncut field sports waving, pollen-full grasses with red clover, while fenced horse enclosures gleam gold with creeping buttercup. Two separate fields, each full of young bullocks a week ago, are stock-free, already sprouting shining blades of grass. This is “mob” grazing (short duration at high stocking density); longer rest periods lead to deeper roots and better soil structure, which is essential to withstand the prolonged periods of dry or wet weather that have become common. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a94e', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/14/epa-chemical-regulation-oil-spill-cleanup-exxon-valdez-bp', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'US government toughens rules on chemicals used to break up oil slicks', 'lead': 'Environmental activists sued EPA to update regulations, after thousands of people sickened from Deepwater Horizon cleanup', 'author': 'Sara Sneath', 'datePublished': '2023-06-14 18:48:32', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561612', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/dd7a628243112c6e32d63184f49952a5bfdbf284/0_100_3000_1801/500.jpg', 'body': 'The Environmental Protection Agency has announced more stringent rules governing offshore oil spill response, amid continuing concerns about the effects on public health and wildlife from chemical disasters, including BP’s Deepwater Horizon explosion in 2010. The federal agency, which announced the update on Monday, had not updated its rule regulating the chemicals used to break up offshore oil slicks since 1994. Five environmental organizations, an Alaskan tribal leader and a south Louisiana fisher sued the EPA in 2020 to force the agency to update its regulations based on lessons learned from the BP oil spill and the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. In 2021, US district court judge William Orrick ordered the EPA to update its oil spill response plans. Thousands of people who rushed into Gulf of Mexico waters to clean up BP’s oil spill have fallen ill, and some have died. A recent Guardian investigation spotlighted the difficult legal fight that cleanup workers who got sick have been experiencing trying to bring medical cases against the oil giant. More than three decades earlier, those who cleaned up the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill off the coast of Alaska suffered the same fate. A growing body of research has linked exposure to the dispersants used by BP to break up oil slicks with chronic illnesses, including increased risk of cancer, heart conditions and an increased rate of births of premature and underweight infants. The updated EPA rule, which takes effect in December, requires dispersants to undergo more stringent toxicity and efficacy testing before they can be approved for use. Dispersants currently approved by the agency must undergo retesting under the new criteria. Products not retested within two years after the rule takes effect or that do not meet the new criteria will be removed from the approved list, according to the updated regulations. Riki Ott, an Alaska toxicologist, began advocating for protections for oil spill cleanup workers in the wake of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill and is the director of Earth Island Institute’s Alert Project, the lead plaintiff in the case against the EPA. “What heartened me was the shift to holding the industry more accountable for its own product use by requiring things that should have been required decades ago,” she said. During the BP spill, millions of gallons of dispersants were pumped underwater to the gushing wellhead and sprayed from planes flying over the Gulf. Calls by members of Congress and public health advocates for a list of chemicals found in the dispersants went unanswered by the company that produced the products, Nalco Holding Co, for weeks during the spill. Nalco said that the ingredients in its products were “confidential business information” and disclosing the chemicals would put the company’s competitive edge at risk. Eventually, a full list of the chemical components was released by the EPA. The updated rule no longer allows companies to hide the chemical ingredients of their products. “Prompt and accurate information will allow the public to evaluate and understand the potential human and environmental effects of these chemical agents,” according to the amended EPA rule. There is also a provision in the rule that allows the EPA to remove products from the approved list of dispersants if a company provides misleading or inaccurate information about what’s in their product or its potential to cause harm. The recent report by the Guardian found that during the BP spill, the oil giant provided cleanup workers with training modules that claimed dispersants used in the Gulf had no ingredients known to cause chronic health effects. “What has happened to the BP workers and coastal residents with all these illnesses and lingering harm and sick and dying children. Nobody wants that to happen again,” Ott said. The updated rule also addresses concerns from Alaska community groups about the effectiveness of dispersants in Arctic waters by requiring companies to test their products in two different temperatures, 5 and 25C. “I think it’s going to be eye-opening for how many of these chemicals actually work when you get down to 5C,” said Sue Mauger, the executive director of Cook Inletkeeper, one of the plaintiffs in the suit against the EPA. More drilling Although Joe Biden campaigned on a promise of halting new drilling on federal land and in federal waters in the face of climate change, new leases were auctioned to fossil fuel firms in the Gulf of Mexico in March and in Alaska’s Cook Inlet in December. The Alaska oil lease sale moved forward under the assumption there is a 19% chance that a large oil spill would happen if more offshore development occurred, according to the Environmental Impact Statement prepared by the US Department of the Interior. Mauger questioned if drilling could continue off the coast of Alaska if companies do not have the option of using dispersants to clean up future oil spills. “I think there ought to be a real serious consideration for not allowing offshore drilling in cold waters,” she said. But Kindra Arnesen, another plaintiff in the case against the EPA, is not ready to celebrate the rule updates. Arnesen, a south Louisiana commercial fisher, said there were more steps ahead to banning the dispersants that she said made her husband and children sick in the wake of the BP spill. “I don’t think this new rule has enough teeth in it to protect my community,” she said. The new rule gives more authority to state and local officials in the decision to use dispersants. In an oil producing state like Louisiana, Arnesen said that may not be a good thing. “Our people will never see justice for the impacts caused by the BP disaster in 2010,” she said. “If it’s left up to the state of Louisiana, the community members will be the tradeoff every time for oil and gas.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a94f', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/14/bernie-krause-sound-ecologist-disappearing-world', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'The sound ecologist capturing a disappearing world: ‘70% of habitats I recorded are gone’', 'lead': 'Bernie Krause has been recording sounds from the natural world for 55 years.

The haunting song of humpback whales conjures the stillness of the deep sea, drowning out the noise of the science museum – and the world – outside. This is The Great Animal Orchestra, a sonic voyage through seven ecosystems composed by the pioneering soundscape ecologist Bernie Krause. After its 2016 premiere at the Fondation Cartier museum in Paris and subsequent tour through Europe and Asia, the immersive exhibit arrives on the west coast for the first time. “It’s about damn time,” said Krause, who’s called the San Francisco Bay Area his home since the late 1950s. Born in Detroit in 1938, Krause is best known for the musicality of his recordings of the natural world. For the last 55 years, he’s evoked the textures and contours of global habitats by layering hundreds of wildlife sounds into succinct tracts, or soundscapes. Soundscape Dzanga-Sangha re-creates an early morning in the Central African Republic rainforest – precisely 8 September 1994 – beginning with the ambient hum of insects buzzing in the dark. The volume erupts at dawn as the first light triggers a chorus of wailing bird calls and croaking hyraxes, whose frequencies appear on a graph, or spectrogram, illuminating the digital walls of the theater. The insects register in the midrange of 6,000 hertz, while the hyrax barely breaks 2,000. The day climaxes with the bellowing roar of elephants thrashing in a salty marsh, a frequency so loud and so low that it sends ripples through a shallow pool of water on the theater floor. “I wanted to give people a sense of the power of these animal narratives,” Krause said, not only to convey the beauty of these habitats, but to highlight the urgency of the climate crisis ravaging our wildlife. His personal library of more than 5,000 hours of recordings holds snapshots of a rapidly deteriorating world. In Krause’s estimation, “Almost 70% of my archive comes from habitats that have disappeared.” Music of the natural world Soundscape ecology is a relatively new field that studies the acoustic relationships between living organisms. As a lifelong musician, Krause contributed to the field by thinking of natural sounds “in musical terms”, he said, as well as coining the word “biophony” to describe the collective living sounds of an ecosystem. Reading spectrograms as musical notation, he noticed that animal sounds each operated at their own distinct frequencies, like singing particular parts of a song. In the early 1980s, when he posited that healthy ecosystems’ sounds function as a highly structured organization, his ideas were dismissed; the scientific community was still recording animal sounds individually. “Guys mostly went on the field with parabolic dishes that separated birds and frogs and insects and mammals out of context, out of the acoustic fabric of the environment,” Krause said. Consequently, “they were never able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again in a way that actually sounded real.” Krause made his first field recording in 1968 in the Muir Woods north of San Francisco, just after signing a Warner Brothers record deal. A tremendously successful electronic musician at the time, he was collecting sounds for In a Wild Sanctuary, a 1970 album remembered as a groundbreaking experiment in combining instruments with wilderness recordings and synthesizers. He recalls his immersion into the forest as a life-changing experience, a relief from his windowless recording studio and gnawing ADHD. Simply put, he said, “I felt alive.” After contributing to the score of Apocalypse Now in 1979, Krause earned a PhD in bioacoustics and spent the next decades retreating alone into the field and simply listening, waiting patiently for the revelations to emerge. A grand epiphany struck him one night in Africa in 1983 as he started to hear the origins of human music in the rhythm and percussion of the natural world. “This is an orchestra,” he thought. “This is what enables us to dance and sing.” An urgent plea for the environment The Great Animal Orchestra is an audiovisual collaboration between Krause and United Visual Artists (UVA), which programmed the spectrograms to illustrate his findings for viewers who might not share his ear. “In a healthy habitat, a spectrogram displays a wide range of animal vocalizations,” Krause explained. These too offer a stark illustration of landscapes in flux. One unedited 1988 recording featured in the exhibition is from Lincoln Meadow, California, and shows a spectrogram dense with the bright, intricate song of finches, quails, sapsuckers and sparrows. In 1989, the orchestra sounds dimmer in comparison, but the difference is particularly stark on the spectrogram: the only visible frequencies belong to a single sapsucker and the flowing river. Between the two years, the meadow had looked exactly the same to Krause, but there lies the urgency of The Great Animal Orchestra: over the course of his career, he’s heard the disappearance of different species before any problems had become visible. As time has worn on, Krause said he’s felt little optimism in the progress against the climate crisis. Where in the 1960s, 10 hours in the field were enough to produce one hour of usable material, the time it takes today is now closer to 1,000 hours. In 2017, he and his wife, Katherine Krause, lost their home to deadly wildfires in Sonoma, California – a disaster of the type that experts say will happen more frequently and intensely as the planet warms. Krause has been something of an outsider for most of his career. “I had this huge library of materials that nobody else was interested in,” he said, releasing albums of his soundscapes through Wild Sanctuary, the environmental outreach organization he runs alongside Katherine. But shortly after he published his 2012 book, The Great Animal Orchestra, Fondation Cartier, a contemporary art museum launched by the French jeweler, approached him with a commission to create an immersive, audiovisual installation. The result is a poignant expression of the world’s interconnectedness through sound. According to Krause, “They had a vision for it that was much bigger than mine.” Krause maintains hope that his work can serve as a moving plea for the environment. “When I create works of art I’m able to reach people on an emotional level” – more than any research paper ever could, he said. “I don’t know that there isn’t some young kid out there who has the imagination and power of expression to convey to enough people that we have to make some changes. But it has to happen very fast.” • This article was amended on 14 June 2023 to reflect that Bernie Krause contributed to the Apocalypse Now soundtrack and did not write it alone.

The company, which was fined £90m in 2021 for discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into protected coastal waters, was ordered to publish 53 documents by the information commissioner at the end of last year because of the “substantial and weighty public interest”. But the company said they contained “sensitive” internal decision-making processes on a live issue relating to sewage discharges, and has refused to release them. Seven months on from the information commissioner’s order to publish, Southern is taking the case to the first-tier tribunal to appeal against the ruling and to keep the documents secret. First reported in Private Eye, the 53 documents relate to discussion at board level in 2020 and 2021, including agendas and minutes of meetings of the board discussing sewage spills or storm overflows. Ofwat, the industry’s regulator, has promised to apply new scrutiny to the boardrooms of water companies. Southern has tried to cite exceptions under the environmental information request (EIR) rules to defend its decision not to release the documents. But the information commissioner has said the exceptions largely do not apply and there is a public interest in releasing the documents. The company argued that the documents should remain secret because of “the need to protect Southern Water’s internal processes of deliberation and decision-making and with regard to the sensitivity of the information and the circumstances surrounding the request”. The company said the request for the documents on sewage spills or overflows in 2020-2021 related to live issues and should not be published. But the commissioner said the public interest favoured disclosing the information, and said there was even greater public interest because the company had pleaded guilty in July 2021 to 51 individual offences of discharging sewage illegally. Evidence presented showed the company had presented a picture of compliance to regulators that was deliberately misleading. “Set against this backdrop, the commissioner considers that there is a substantial and weighty public interest in understanding what measures the public authority was taking, during the period covered by the request, to improve its performance and put measures in place to prevent a recurrence of the offences,” the information commissioner has said. Ed Acteson, of the campaign group SOS Whitstable, said: “Southern is repeatedly saying it is going to be more transparent but we are just not sure that is the case.” He said data on the company’s Beachbuoy app had recently been changed to make it more difficult for the public to see where raw sewage discharges were taking place or their impact. Last year Southern was accused of “environmental vandalism” after discharging raw sewage for more than 3,700 hours at 83 bathing water beaches during the first eight days of November alone. The information commissioner said the company operated a monopoly and if customers were dissatisfied with the way wastewater was being handled, they did not have the right to ask another company to handle it instead. “One of the few powers consumers do have, is to make use of the EIR to seek environmental information such as this and use that information to hold the public authority to account, the information commissioner said.

The leaks, first reported by WA Today, are located at the Legendre gas field north of the Pilbara port of Dampier, and were detected by an underwater vehicle in 2013. In a report to the petroleum regulator, Nopsema, Santos wrote it was “not feasible” to stop the leaks, which are described on the regulator’s website as “ongoing gas seepage in the form of small bubbles”. The company has proposed monitoring the wells for five years under an environment plan. A Santos spokesperson said the company had engaged the national science agency, the CSIRO, to “undertake an in-depth monitoring program”. “Findings to date show that the gas is nontoxic and unlikely to present an environmental hazard,” they said. “Santos is currently implementing a management plan that includes a regular monitoring program.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A Nopsema spokesperson said the regulator had asked Santos to “undertake activity to show the cause of the reported seepage and required that Santos submit an environment plan to demonstrate the appropriate management of any works undertaken”. The spokesperson said the regulator could not comment on the specifics of the environment plan while it was under assessment. Jeff Waters, an offshore fossil gas campaigner at the environment group Friends of the Earth, disagreed with Santos’s assessment the leaks were nontoxic. “Certainly it’s toxic to the environment in the sense that it’s adding to the greenhouse gas emissions of Australia,” he said. “My question to [climate and energy minister] Chris Bowen is ‘how many greenhouse gas initiatives are being cancelled out by rogue emissions from leaking wells and what’s the government going to do about it?’” A spokesperson for Bowen said estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from abandoned gas wells were reported in Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory and were taken into account against Australia’s emissions reduction targets. Nopsema has regulatory oversight of 873 wells. Of these, 457 are operational wells, while 326 are shut-in, suspended or temporarily abandoned wells. The remaining 90 have been plugged and abandoned and are awaiting final signoff from Nopsema that it is satisfied those works are complete. The Legendre project ceased production in 2011 and wells were decommissioned by the then-operator, Apache.

On the eve of a vote on the nature restoration law (NRL) package, the chairman of the centre-right European People’s party (EPP) said the vote was “50-50” with potential for others to join their opposition ranks on Thursday. On Wednesday evening the chair of the environment committee, Pascal Canfin, urged members to vote for the act accusing the EPP of “fake news” over food production. “Our food security depends on protecting nature from collapsing. Yet, the right and the far right are joining forces against the nature restoration law that we’re voting on Thursday. My answers to their fake news,” he said. The proposals are aimed at protecting all endangered ecosystems ranging from rivers and seas to peat bogs and indigenous forests by 2050 through legally binding targets. The UN environment chief Inger Andersen urged MEPs to show leadership for future generations ahead of the vote and deliver on the promises the union made at Cop15 just 6 months ago. She condemned those that had turned restoring biodiversity into a culture war issue. EPP chairman Manfred Weber said his group of MPs supported goals on climate change but said the NRL was “a bad proposal”, which would reduce food production on the continent. “The overwhelming majority of farmers don’t need any lesson about sustainability, they got their farms from previous generations so they know what sustainability means,” he said. Irish Green party MEP Ciarán Cuffe, who is stewarding parallel proposals on renovation of energy inefficient buildings through parliament, said he worried about a potential deeper EPP resistance on climate emergency measures. “I’m concerned that the EPP’s commitment to climate and biodiversity is lukewarm. We have been told they have a kill list of laws they don’t want to see passed. The climate and biodiversity crises have not gone away and if anything we need to step up efforts in the face of foreseen newspaper headlines about extreme temperatures and warming,” he said. While Weber claimed the proposals would harm Europe’s food production by sequestering land for rewilding and other projects, Cuffe said the 12-volume, 5,689-page impact assessment put the economic benefits of restoring nature at €180bn (£154bn) compared with the cost of the measures which have been put at €154bn. The World Wildlife Fund has also argued, along with the Greens, that increasing biodiversity including bees and other pollinators actually improves food production. German MEP Peter Liese, the environment spokesperson for the EPP, said on Wednesday the votes were now split 42:42 of the 84 strong committee with EPP representing 22 of those. “We have four undecided votes, it will be very tight,” he said. He said one of the main concerns is that the European commission has not set in stone of definition of “degraded” land or rivers. Under its present guise, it could require 25,000 kilometres of European rivers to be restored to wilderness, he said, impacting the development and existing hydro-electric plants. “The problem with the impact assessment report is that it was written before the outbreak of war,” said Liese. On Monday, CEOs from 50 companies including Ikea, Nestle and H&amp;M published an open letter voicing their support for the law, warning protecting nature was key to a well-functioning economy. Andersen, the executive director of the UN environment programme, told the Guardian it was critical that the EU delivered on the promises it had made to the world on nature. “Talk is easy. You have to follow through. I think if if the EU does not follow through with the targets that it has in the nature restoration law, it sends a detrimental signal to the global commitment to protect biodiversity and to the tears that we shared that night at 4am in Montreal. It would negate it all. “There’s a real to do item here: for those folks that sit in the EU parliament to do the right thing by the next generation,” she said. “How can nature become a culture wars issue? To me, it is absurd. Nature is what feeds us and sustains us. It’s everything.” Last month, EU environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius warned abandoning the law would send “a dangerous, negative signal to the world”. Alongside separate proposals to reduce pesticide use and climate laws, the NRL is part of the European Green Deal. Weber told reporters in Strasbourg: “We will not achieve our climate change goals, our goals on biodiversity [if we go] against the rural areas,” he said. Under the proposals, 88 MEPs on the committee leading the passage of the act, will be asked to vote on a version of the European Commission’s proposed laws which has been slightly watered down to try to secure the agreement of the European parliament. They will be asked to support measures to “put in place, without delay, effective and area-based restoration measures which shall collectively cover, by 2030, at least 30% of the union’s land, freshwater and sea areas in need of restoration”. But Weber indicated his group would not be budging. “We have a lot of concerns which cannot be fixed with this concrete proposal. That’s why we asked for a restart, for a new proposal from the European Commission.” The EPP has already walked out of negotiations on the NRL and is hoping others will join them in opposition to the legislation during the vote on Thursday.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a954', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/14/country-diary-there-are-swifts-aplenty-but-where-are-the-swallows', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: There are swifts aplenty, but where are the swallows? | Derek Niemann', 'lead': '<strong>Sandy, Bedfordshire:</strong> For the first month, I blamed persistent winds from the north.

In front of open water, I said to my wife and the indifferent wind: “And this is where we will see our first swallow.” Two breaths later, there it was, jinking in from our left, as if pewter clouds had parted to birth spring. There was no great clairvoyance on my part. Like many birders, I have anticipated local arrival dates for migrants in my head after watching for them over many years. This swallow was three days past its due date and, as lakes and rivers are reliable fuelling spots with their early hatches of flying insects, its appearance was to be expected. But could I have anticipated what would not happen next? At the time of writing, I have looked up at a lot of blue sky and clouds, scanned water bodies and lush meadows, and followed pointy-winged starlings that I’ve tried to will into something else. There have been swifts aplenty, yes, but my swallow count to date is less than 20 birds, and my house martin tally not even in double figures. For the first month, I blamed persistent winds from the north, imagining the hirundines held up in France or Spain. Now, I’m simply baffled by the dearth. Today I’m comforted a little by another gap, another hedge and a bird that knows its own width. This swallow skims the farm reservoir, then slips through an opening in a hedge and scythes back over the top. It slices in front of my midriff and over the lake, a blue-black back against grey, then turns again and is slashing back and forth, behind me, in front, turning me round to spin in wonder at how it can keep one eye on where it’s going, one after potential prey, and one on me.

For a species that spends much of its life feasting on decayed matter, the insects appear to be particularly sensitive to their own dead. Witnessing an abundance of fruit fly carcasses speeds up the insects’ ageing process, scientists found, cutting their lives short by nearly 30%. While the researchers are cautious about extrapolating from 3mm-long flies to rather larger humans that can live 400 times longer, they speculate that the insights might prove useful for people who are routinely surrounded by death, such as combat troops and healthcare workers. “Could motivational therapy or pharmacologic intervention in reward systems, much like what is done for addiction, slow ageing?” the authors ask in Plos Biology. The possibility could be tested in humans today, they added, using drugs that are already approved. Researchers led by Christi Gendron and Scott Pletcher at the University of Michigan raised fruit flies in small containers filled with food. While some of the containers held only living flies and tasty nutrients, others were dotted with freshly dead fruit flies as well, to see what impact they had on the feeding insects. When fruit flies were raised among dead ones, they tended to die several weeks earlier than those raised without being surrounded by carcasses. Those exposed to death appeared to age faster, losing stored fat and becoming less resilient to starvation. To investigate further, the scientists turned to a biological tool that helped them pinpoint which brain circuits switched on when fruit flies hung out with dead comrades. The more active neurons became in the flies’ brains, the more of a fluorescent protein those neurons produced. When the scientists dissected the fruit fly brains after the experiments, they found that two specific types of neurons, known as R2 and R4, were activated when the insects were raised in an environment full of dead flies. When they stimulated these same neurons in healthy fruit flies, it had the same life-shortening effect: the flies died younger, despite not witnessing the dead bodies of others. Understanding more about how flies’ brains transform their physiology to accelerate the ageing process might pave the way for new treatments to slow ageing in humans, the scientists suggest. But one possibility is that all that death simply gets the flies down, and eventually becomes too much. “Given our findings,” the authors write, “it seems plausible that the sight of dead conspecifics elucidates a “depressive-like” state that results in decreased longevity.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a956', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/13/greta-thunberg-not-phasing-out-fossil-fuels-is-death-sentence-for-worlds-poor', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Greta Thunberg: not phasing out fossil fuels is ‘death sentence’ for world’s poor', 'lead': 'Climate activist says only ‘rapid and equitable’ phaseout will keep temperatures within 1.5C limit', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-13 15:17:22', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561762', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/6020b3cebbaccf0d1167888a368e9fc629d88e2b/0_172_4047_2428/500.jpg', 'body': 'Rich countries are signing a “death sentence” for millions of poor people around the world by failing to phase out fossil fuels, the climate activist Greta Thunberg has told governments. She warned on Tuesday that with annual greenhouse gas emissions at an all-time high, only a “rapid and equitable” phaseout of fossil fuels would keep global temperatures within the scientifically advised limit of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. “The coming months and years – right now – will be crucial to what the future looks like. It is what we decide now that will define the rest of humanity’s future,” she told a press conference at UN talks in Bonn, where governments are meeting to discuss the climate crisis. “If we do not [phase out fossil fuels], it will be a death sentence for countless people. It is already a death sentence for countless people,” she said. Thunberg last Friday announced the end of her school strikes, which she has been undertaking on Fridays since 2018 in protest at political inaction on the climate crisis. The campaigner has left school but intends to carry on speaking out on climate issues, while also giving the spotlight to youth voices from the developing world. She said a lack of political will to halt fossil fuel exploration and use was threatening to raise global temperatures by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, which could lead the climate to pass “tipping points”, a cascade of impacts that could create runaway global heating. “We are still rushing towards the cliff. We could trigger feedback loops that are beyond human control, that would throw countless billions under the bus,” she said. The question of phasing out fossil fuels is expected to be a flashpoint at the Cop28 UN climate talks later this year. The summit will take place in Dubai, hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer. Many countries would like to see Cop28 produce a formal resolution to phase out fossil fuels, or at least to discuss such a phaseout as an official agenda item at the summit. But some countries, chiefly fossil fuel producers including Saudi Arabia, are staunchly opposed, and the UAE presidency has been cautious, saying there is not yet agreement on the agenda. Chairing the talks will be Sultan Al Jaber, a minister in the UAE government who is also chief of the country’s national oil company, Adnoc, which is planning a massive expansion of fossil fuel production capacity. Eric Njuguna, a climate justice organiser from Kenya, speaking with Thunberg, said Al Jaber’s dual role was a conflict of interest, and called on him to resign. “It is a stab in the back for poor countries to have a fossil fuel CEO on top of efforts to constrain the climate crisis,” he said. Al Jaber has told the Guardian he will bring a “business mindset” to the talks, and pointed to his role as co-founder of the Masdar renewable energy company in UAE. He visited the Bonn talks last Thursday, and told a public meeting: “The phasedown of fossil fuels is inevitable.” But he stopped well short of promising to put a phaseout of fossil fuels on the Cop28 agenda. The talks in Bonn, which started last Monday and will end on Thursday, are to lay the groundwork for Cop28, the conference of the parties under the UN framework convention on climate change, which begins on 30 November. Progress at Bonn has been slow. Last week’s discussions were characterised by disputes over rich countries that are failing to provide financial assistance to developing countries, to help them cut their greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of the climate crisis. Alden Meyer, a senior associate at the thinktank E3G, said: “Much more work remains to be done to land an agreement at Cop28 for a just and equitable reduction of fossil fuel production and use in a timeframe that’s consistent with the Paris [agreement] 1.5C goal.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a957', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/13/from-window-boxes-to-farms-uks-rewilding-gurus-bring-out-their-bible', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'From window boxes to farms, UK’s rewilding gurus bring out their bible', 'lead': 'Ideas from the Knepp estate in West Sussex – home to beavers, turtle doves and purple emperors – can be used in the smallest spaces, its owners say', 'author': 'Patrick Barkham', 'datePublished': '2023-06-13 12:01:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561780', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/ca49971c034ecab9b4aa575645617a52cfee6e3a/0_143_5370_3222/500.jpg', 'body': 'An aristocratic couple struggling to run a large farm may not elicit much sympathy. And the tale of how they turned around a loss-making business may seem a niche interest. But Wilding, Isabella Tree’s story of how the Knepp estate in West Sussex was rewilded, has not only sold a quarter of a million copies worldwide and been translated into eight languages, it has inspired thousands of landowners, large and small, to rewild fields and gardens in an attempt to halt catastrophic biodiversity losses. The Knepp effect is about to get bigger with the publication of The Book of Wilding by Tree and her husband, Charlie Burrell. This 560-page behemoth is a practical manual for aspiring rewilders, from businesses and landowners to urban community groups and individuals with window boxes. The book gives guidance on everything from keeping water buffalo to reducing light pollution in gardens; from preventing flooding in cities to rewilding schools. The Book of Wilding came about because Tree, who was giving nearly 100 public talks a year before the pandemic, and Burrell, who has offered countless behind-the-scenes tours and guidance to policymakers and politicians, were besieged with practical questions about how to follow Knepp’s example. “We’re getting questions all the time, not just from people with land but who have a back garden or a window box,” said Tree. “Some people are very territorial about rewilding – they say, oh, it’s not real rewilding unless you’ve got 100 acres or free-roaming herbivores or apex predators. We wanted to get across this idea that rewilding is on a spectrum and everybody is on it, no matter how tiny the amount of soil under your jurisdiction is. It can even be a planter on your doorstep.” Knepp’s 3,500 acres were a conventional dairy and intensive arable farm until the turn of the century, when financial losses and the visit of an ancient tree expert convinced Burrell to stop farming. Fields scrubbed up, free-roaming longhorn cattle, pigs and ponies were introduced, and wildlife flocked back. Last summer more than 50 singing male nightingales – one of Britain’s rarest birds – were recorded at Knepp alongside near-extinct turtle doves. The rewilding project is considered the best site in Britain for the elusive purple emperor butterfly, and reintroduced beavers and storks are thriving. For years, the farm’s transformation was greeted by indifference from other landowners and drew hostility from neighbours who complained that the farm spread “weeds” such as ragwort. But the publication of Wilding in 2018 was a turning point, and suddenly landowners large and small started following Knepp’s example. “Until it was explained in a book, in a story, nothing was happening,” said Burrell. “Then the book came out and it was a constant, constant flow of visitors.” Forms of rewilding – or “wilding” (the r-word is particularly controversial in upland Britain) – have been embraced by high-profile farmers, from sheep farmer and writer James Rebanks in Cumbria to Jeremy Clarkson in the Cotswolds. Large landowners have turned to rewilding in the hope of matching the profits at the formerly loss-making Knepp. The farm’s finances are boosted by lucrative business rentals in its old buildings and its glamping and wildlife safaris are now worth £1m each year. The conventional farm employed 23 people before it shut down but the rewilded enterprise employs more than 50, with another 50 jobs to be created when Knepp’s restaurant and farm shop, run by the couple’s son, Ned, opens. Knepp sold £350,000 of free-range meat produced on its land direct to consumers last year. Burrell has also launched a company, Nattergal, which is buying farms to restore nature as a commercial enterprise, with new revenues not from producing food but from payments for biodiversity credits, as well as carbon credits and government support for ecosystem services such as reducing flooding or improving water quality. The company is rewilding a 1,525-acre farm in Lincolnshire it bought for £13.75m and has begun rewilding its second acquisition, a fenland farm in Norfolk. Knepp has also had a profound impact on conservation charities and community groups, many of whom have embraced its rewilding model. Charities including Suffolk Wildlife Trust, Hampshire &amp; Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and Radnorshire Wildlife Trust have bought farms on which they are restoring nature by stopping intensive farming and introducing “extensive” free-roaming livestock, (which may produce some food via free-range meat). Kent Wildlife Trust has introduced bison as well as free-roaming pigs and ponies into the ancient Blean Woods near Canterbury as part of an ambitious rewilding scheme inspired by Knepp. Evan Bowen-Jones, chief executive of KWT, said: “Knepp is an iconic project in UK conservation terms now. All these serendipitous benefits have proved the case around things like nightingales not being dependent upon coppicing.” He also noted that letting pigs roam freely had churned up the ground and allowed for goat willow, the favoured food of purple emperor caterpillars, to regrow. He said Knepp showed that “the open-ended restoration of native habitat in a dynamic way has huge biodiversity and bioabundance benefits that have not been replicated anywhere else on sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) or national nature reserves or all these other alleged jewels in the crown that we’ve been trying to preserve against the tide of climate change. “We need to be trying different things and the fact that Knepp tried something so different and it has proven so successful is fantastic.” Knepp has attracted criticism too. Purist rewilders say its use of livestock to mimic the grazing of extinct herbivores is not meaningful rewilding because there are no apex predators and it is not at a landscape scale. Many conservation scientists oppose rewilding nature reserves, predicting that Britain’s rarest species will become extinct without targeted management, while other conservationists wonder if Knepp’s successes will be sustained. Ben McFarland, director of wildlife conservation and recovery at Suffolk Wildlife Trust, which recently bought an organic farm to return to nature as Martlesham Wilds, said: “Knepp is brilliant and they’ve done something really special. But scrub is transitional habitat. Will their grazing regime retain scrub levels where they are at the moment? The jury is out. If scrub becomes mature woodland, will they put their hands up and say, ‘We’ve lost our turtle doves but we’re wilders, we’re going to keep going’ or are they going to say, ‘We love our turtle dove, we’re going to do a bit more intervention’? I’d do more intervention and keep the turtle dove.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a958', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/13/turkmenistan-moves-towards-plugging-massive-methane-leaks', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Turkmenistan moves towards plugging massive methane leaks', 'lead': 'Central Asian country has the worst rate of climate-heating ‘super-emitter’ events in the world', 'author': 'Damian Carrington Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-13 10:55:32', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561798', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d717c24774c309be869c025af6bf982e7af133ab/0_0_3264_1958/500.jpg', 'body': 'The president of Turkmenistan has launched two initiatives aimed at cutting the colossal leaks of methane from the country’s oil and gas industry. Success would represent a major achievement in tackling the climate crisis. A roadmap will pave the way towards the central Asian country joining 150 others that have already signed the Global Methane Pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. An inter-departmental government commission will also focus on reducing emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas. Methane emissions cause 25% of global heating today. A surge since 2007 may be the biggest threat to keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5C and seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points, according to scientists. Tackling leaks from fossil fuel sites is the fastest, simplest and cheapest way to slash methane emissions. Turkmenistan was responsible for the highest number of methane “super-emitter” events in the world in 2022, the Guardian revealed in March. The worst leak caused climate pollution equivalent to the rate of emissions from 67m cars. The US and Russia also had a large number of super-emitter events. “It is very encouraging that a global effort is under way to assist Turkmenistan to mitigate its methane emissions, and that local authorities are responsive,” said Manfredi Caltagirone, head of the UN’s International Methane Emissions Observatory (Imeo). “But after the announcements, the real work starts to actually cut emissions,” he said. “Operators in Turkmenistan need to perform measurements on each of their assets, report transparently and mitigate effectively.” Caltagirone said Imeo and the UN office in Turkmenistan were ready to step up their support. President Serdar Berdimuhamedov approved the methane roadmap for 2023-2024 during a cabinet meeting on 10 June. Measures include improving national legislation, cooperation with foreign partners to set up pilot projects and collaboration with Imeo. Berdimuhamedov stressed that Turkmenistan would continue to contribute in every possible way to regional and global environmental partnerships, according to reports. At the UN climate summit Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, Berdimuhamedov said Turkmenistan was reducing greenhouse gas emissions “by introducing modern technologies in all spheres of the state’s economy”, with “special attention” to the reduction of methane emissions. Satellite data analysis for the Guardian showed little change in Turkmenistan’s methane emissions from 2019-2022. Scientists whose recent research focused on 29 super-emitter events between 2017 and 2020 said the more frequent emitters were already in “conflict with Turkmen law”. The decree authorising the interdepartmental commission on reducing methane emissions was signed by Berdimuhamedov on 2 June, a few days after he had spoken to John Kerry, the US special envoy for climate, about potential financial support and expertise. In May, the Guardian revealed that methane leaks alone from Turkmenistan’s two main fossil fuel fields caused more global heating in 2022 than the entire carbon emissions of the UK. Emissions of the gas were “mind-boggling” and an “infuriating” problem that should be easy to fix, experts said. Foreign investment may be crucial to ending the leaks. A recent comment article in Eurasia Review said the country’s government was “allergic to spending its own money on such undertakings” The leaks are believed to come from ageing and poorly maintained oil and gas pipelines and from the venting to the atmosphere of unwanted methane gas that is produced alongside oil.

The technology, which collects energy from the sun using satellite-mounted panels and beams it to Earth, had huge potential to boost the UK’s energy security, the UK’s energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said. Although the idea of building commercial power stations in space may sound far-fetched, the space industry has long been at the forefront of solar power development. Indeed, the need to power satellites was a key driver in increasing the efficiency of solar panels that generate electricity for homes and businesses, said Dr Mamatha Maheshwarappa, the payload systems lead at the UK Space Agency. Among the recipients of the funding from the government’s space-based solar power innovation competition are Cambridge University, which is developing ultra-lightweight solar panels that can withstand the high radiation levels encountered in space, and Queen Mary University of London, which is developing a wireless system to allow space-harvested solar power to be safely beamed to Earth. This month, scientists at the California Institute of Technology in the US claimed to have successfully transmitted solar power to Earth from space for the first time, using a prototype spacecraft called Maple that was launched into orbit in January. It uses an array of flexible lightweight transmitters to convert electricity into microwaves before beaming them to a specific location on Earth – in this case, a receiver on the roof of a building on Caltech’s campus in Pasadena – where they are converted back into electrical energy. Assuming that the technology can be made to work on a large scale, there would be some significant advantages to space-based solar farms. Because there is no atmosphere in space, the sun’s light is undiluted, meaning each panel would be able to generate more energy compared with an equivalent panel on Earth. The solar energy would also be more predictable and continuous due to the absence of day-night cycles, cloud cover and seasonal variations in sunlight. A UK government-commissioned independent study in 2021 found that space-based solar power could generate up to 10GW capacity a year by 2050, a quarter of the UK’s current electricity demand. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has claimed it could create a multibillion-pound industry and up to 143,000 jobs across the country. Announcing the funding at London Tech Week, Shapps said: “We’re taking a giant leap by backing the development of this exciting technology and putting the UK at the forefront of this rapidly emerging industry as it prepares for launch. By winning this new space race, we can transform the way we power our nation and provide cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy for generations to come.” Other projects to be awarded funding are: Satellite Applications Catapult Ltd in Didcot, for an experiment to test the electronic steering and beam quality of its space satellite antenna technology; MicroLink Devices UK Ltd in Port Talbot, to develop the next generation of lightweight, flexible solar panels; and the University of Bristol, to produce a simulation of solar space wireless power transfer capability and provide further evidence on the performance, safety and reliability of space-based solar. Imperial College London and EDF Energy will also receive funding for studies to assess how electricity from space-based power stations could be integrated into the electricity grid alongside other low-carbon energy sources. • This article was amended on 13 June 2023.

Now a springer spaniel called Freya has taken up the scent of another slippery species: the great crested newt. Sheltering in underground burrows and rocky crevices, these warty amphibians are a protected species under rules overseen by Natural England. Boris Johnson previously complained that newt-counting delays had become “a massive drag on the prosperity of this country” because building developers must search for, and move them, before construction projects can begin. Yet, while much is known about the newts’ aquatic life phase, detecting them during their terrestrial phase is challenging because they spend so much of their time underground, limiting the effectiveness of these conservation policies and practices. Rising to this challenge, Nicola Jayne Glover, an ecology PhD student at the University of Salford, UK, and her colleagues trained Glover’s English springer spaniel, Freya, to learn the odour of live newts by channelling their scent through open pipes of varying lengths. They also put newts in breathable tubes and buried them under 20cm of clay or sandy soil for Freya to detect, with small ventilation holes in some of the soil samples to mimic newt nesting burrows. Over 16 trial runs, Freya was able to detect great crested newts up to 2 metres away, with an 87% success rate. She was fastest at detecting newts through clay soil with ventilation, and could tell them apart from other creatures, including frogs and other newt species. When Freya sniffed out a great crested newt, she would signal this to her handler by lying or sitting down. Although dogs have previously been trained to detect giant bullfrogs – which also occupy underground burrows – and are routinely used to help locate buried human remains, this is the first study which explicitly investigates the influence of different soil types on dogs’ ability to locate underground amphibians. “Our study provides a general baseline for the use of detection dogs in locating T. cristatus and similar amphibian species during their terrestrial phase,” said Glover, whose results were published in Plos One. She believes newt-identification is a task that many dogs could be trained to do, and has already trained her other dog, a springer-cocker spaniel named Newky, to do so. Freya and Newky have already saved the lives of countless newts, Glover said. The great crested newt is the UK’s largest newt, reaching a maximum adult overall length of up to 17cm. It takes its name from the striking, jagged crest that males display in the spring breeding season.

Conservation scientists spoke out after black-veined whites, which fell extinct in Britain 100 years ago, reappeared on a nature reserve near Croydon. Reintroductions of extinct species require licences from Natural England, the government’s conservation watchdog, and permission must also be sought to move rare protected butterflies to new sites. Butterfly Conservation recently oversaw the successful reintroduction of the extinct chequered skipper to England with butterflies from Belgium but experts report “an outpouring” of unofficial releases of rare butterflies over the last five years. Maverick breeders, heartened by public enthusiasm for rewilding and frustrated by the slow pace of restoration by mainstream conservation organisations, have released endangered marsh fritillaries and Glanville fritillaries on to dozens of new sites and also non-native species including the marbled fritillary. The breeders calculate that global heating makes Britain increasingly conducive to butterflies previously restricted to warmer countries. “It is illegal to release an extinct species to Britain on to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) with no disease control,” Dan Hoare, the conservation director of Butterfly Conservation, said of the return of the black-veined white. “There’s good scientific evidence that this could be not only ineffective but actively damaging. If you’re bringing in specimens from abroad you could be bringing in diseases. I would support someone being prosecuted for that.” About 15 black-veined whites have been spotted at the London Wildlife Trust reserve of Hutchinson’s Bank, where in recent years endangered British species the Glanville fritillary, marsh fritillary and Duke of Burgundy have also suddenly appeared. Experts agree that the butterflies were highly unlikely to reach the site naturally and have been secretly put there by breeders. “It’s just ridiculous – it’s become an outdoor zoo,” said Hoare of the site, which is popular with many butterfly enthusiasts hoping to see rare species. Conservation scientists argue that unofficially introduced butterflies usually vanish again within several years. They say their release can put pressure on conservationists to manage a nature reserve to preserve that new species – actions that may be to the detriment of other rare invertebrates naturally found on the site. Matthew Oates, a conservationist who has previously pointed out the positive contribution made by butterfly breeders, said the latest rogue releases had gone too far. “I really feel for the conservation professionals who are trying to care for these sites. There’s been this outpouring of releases, particularly of Glanville fritillaries and marsh fritillaries. It’s stopping butterflies from speaking for themselves and masking our ability to measure natural spreads and contractions of their ranges.” Moving more common butterflies such as the small blue on to new sites is not illegal if the breeder has permission from the landowner and the release site is not a protected area such as a SSSI. Conservationist scientists say that rogue releases of native species risk undermining the diversity of butterfly subspecies in the country, potentially merging the genetic stock of different “ecotypes”, butterflies that have developed distinct habits or wing patterns in different regions. For instance, there are four subspecies of silver-studded blue in Britain. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a butterfly breeder said that there was an extinction crisis, conventional charities’ wildlife restoration was far too slow, and there was no evidence of accidentally introduced disease or “lethal genes” from releases damaging other butterfly or invertebrate populations. The breeder, who has successfully returned hundreds of native butterflies to sites from where they had vanished, including the small blue and the purple emperor, said: “We can’t wait for Butterfly Conservation to pull their finger out. We’ve got to do something. It gives people a lot of joy too, which is why it has popular support. “It’s wonderful if it works but if it doesn’t the introduced butterfly simply dies out. If it’s a species that isn’t in a particular area you won’t be introducing lethal genes because they won’t meet others of the same species. There are a lot of false arguments.” Matthew Frith, of London Wildlife Trust, said it did not have the resources to investigate or prosecute rogue releases at Hutchinson’s Bank, nor did it wish to “add fuel to the fire” of a polarised debate. But Frith said the multiple species introductions on the site had put them in “an awkward situation”. “The whole credibility of the trust as a conservation organisation is being called into question,” he said. “We’re in a nature crisis. Do we relax some of the rules now because we’re running out of time? There is a debate to be had which is about looking at reducing some of the barriers to allow well-considered introductions. “Hutchinson’s Bank is not managed as a butterfly garden but if through our management it supports a fantastic range of butterflies, that is to be celebrated.” Delphine Pouget, the principal adviser for species reintroduction for Natural England, said: “Restoring lost species is an important and inspiring aspect of nature recovery, but it requires proper planning and execution to succeed and avoid any risks. “For anyone interested in planning a conservation translocation project, they should align with Defra’s code and guidance for England on reintroduction and other conservation translocation.” Reintroductions – official and “rogue” Licensed Large blue, Britain Fell extinct in Britain in 1979, brought back to one site in Devon via caterpillars from Sweden. Took 30 years of conservation management before populations boomed and spread naturally; Britain now has the best population of the butterflies in Europe. Chequered skipper, England Extinct in England in 1977; adult butterflies collected in Belgium and returned to Northamptonshire woodland in 2018 by Butterfly Conservation. Population now in two sites. Marsh fritillary, Cumbria 200 colonies dwindled to none by 2004. The last butterflies taken into captivity were found to be genetically very weak and so Scottish breeding stock was added to produce 42,000 larvae, released on to four sites. The butterfly is thriving again in Cumbria. Rogue Marsh fritillary, Chambers Farm Wood, Lincolnshire Experts say the Marsh fritillary population released years ago by renowned breeder Martin White is genetically too narrow, requires intensive management to sustain it, and is too isolated to expand naturally. Adonis blue, Devil’s Dyke, Cambridgeshire Huge population flying there this year after a handful sighted in 2020. The butterfly could never reach this site by itself. The Chalkhill blue and small blue have also been successfully returned to East Anglia by unofficial releases. Glanville fritillary, Weston-super-Mare Unofficial release endured on the Somerset coast for some years from the 1990s but then died out. Critics say other unofficial Glanville releases on the mainland are doomed to fail – the species only survives naturally on the Isle of Wight because constant coastal erosion sustains its caterpillar’s foodplant.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a95d', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/12/can-you-spot-the-phezukomkhono-thats-zulu-for-red-chested-cuckoo', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Can you spot the phezukomkhono?

But now the gannet, which can plunge into the ocean at speeds of up to 120km/h when hunting sardines, finally has a Zulu name that does it justice: isicibamanzi (the spear into the water). After years of research and work with Indigenous communities, a list of isiZulu vernacular names for all 878 birds found in South Africa has recently been put together. “In South Africa, birding has always had a bit of a stigma as a white people’s thing,” says Nandi Thobela of BirdLife South Africa, the organisation behind the isiZulu bird names project. While there are many reasons for this, the fact that bird names (and field guides) were all in English or Afrikaans certainly didn’t help. “When you have to translate a word, you lose people,” says Thobela. Birding may be a predominantly white pursuit, but the birds themselves have always been important to the Indigenous people of South Africa. “The Nguni languages were developed from people observing nature,” says Thobela. “Before people had clocks and calendars, it was the birds that told farmers when to reap and when to sow.” A case in point is the phezukomkhono, the recently ratified Zulu name for the red-chested cuckoo. Sakhamuzi Mhlongo, one of the bird guides who has been involved in the project since its inception, explains that the name has been in use for centuries: “This bird has always been used by ladies to know when to plant their crops. Every spring they wait and wait and wait for the phezukomkhono to come back from migration. Phezukomkhono means ‘roll up your sleeves’ and grab your hand hoe and plant the crops. It’s got a good meaning for Zulu-speaking people.” “Language and culture encode and express our meaningful engagement with the world,” says the Cambridge University linguist Karen Park. “For a language like isiZulu, spoken by people who have inhabited the region of South Africa for millennia, words can hold both a deep knowledge of place and a powerful connection to ancestry and cultural identity.” While English bird names often follow conservative conventions (like relying on chest markings or naming them after old white explorers), Zulu names are far more varied and original. The black cuckoo is an undodosibona (man who sees us), a reference to the bird calling from dense vegetation where people can’t see it; the African emerald cuckoo is ubantwanyana, a verbalisation of the bird’s call – it supposedly sings: “Little children don’t get married!”; and Klaas’s cuckoo is an umazalashiye (the bird that lays eggs and then leaves them behind). The standardised list of isiZulu bird names has been more than a decade in the making. In 2012, Noleen Turner and Adrian Koopman – both isiZulu professors at the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal – led an effort to compile a complete list of Zulu names for birds found in the Kwa-Zulu Natal province (where most ethnic Zulu speakers live). They first canvassed communities to ascertain which of the province’s 500 bird species already had names. It turned out that some species had many names, some had one name, and some had none. They then brought together 30 Zulu-speaking bird guides from around the province for a series of naming workshops. If there was already a Zulu name this always took precedence. When several names existed, the guides would debate and settle on one name that best represented the bird. When no name existed, they would work together to come up with a name. “You want a name that makes people remember the bird,” says Mhlongo. Ornithology experts were on hand to tell of the identifying features and habits of each species, but the final say always went to the ethnic Zulus. “It feels really good to know that there is a complete list of bird names in my language,” says Mhlongo. “The fact that the list was made by Zulu speakers and for Zulu speakers is the cherry on the top.” Park echoes this view: “The systematic, comprehensive and community-led approach sets an important standard of multidisciplinary collaboration and local empowerment, ownership and engagement that I hope to see emulated.” She believes that global engagement with our natural world “too often overlooks the rich cultural and linguistic context of the people who inhabit the places that compel our interest. I find this has especially been the case with global biodiversity conservation organisations, which tend to impose a western science framework on the practice of protecting, maintaining and restoring biological diversity.” By 2018, Koopman and Turner’s team had finalised Zulu names for all the birds found in Kwa-Zulu Natal. Then came the publication, in 2020, of a glossy, full-colour book: Birds of KwaZulu-Natal and Their Zulu Names. “For so many years, we’ve been having this problem of getting black people into birding,” says Mhlongo. “It’s always easier to learn something when you are still young. Now we have a book that is written in black and white. The kids can take it home and read about the birds, and the parents can read it too.” Inspired by all this groundbreaking work, BirdLife South Africa decided to extend the project to include all birds found in South Africa. The recently completed nationwide bird list is currently out for public comment. “We wanted to give Zulu speakers a chance to challenge or improve the list,” says Thobela. “But so far we have only received praise and encouragement.” They have already been contacted by Sepedi and Setswana linguists who are keen to create bird lists in their languages. And BirdLife South Africa is on the verge of agreeing a deal with a large international app developer to create a free isiZulu bird app. “Ultimately, we want to have bird names in all 11 languages,” says Thobela. “We started with isiZulu because of the pioneering work done by the profs and because Zulu is so widely spoken. But we want all South Africans to feel a connection with the birds that live around them.” While Thobela hopes it won’t be another 10 years until the next list is completed, she and the rest of the team won’t be rushing it either. “Involving the local bird guides, and giving them the final say on every bird name, is what made this project so special.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a95e', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/12/country-diary-finding-a-rare-treasure-out-of-the-blue', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: Finding a rare treasure, out of the blue | Nic Wilson', 'lead': '<strong>Hexton Chalk Pit, Hertfordshire: </strong>A male small blue, the UK’s tiniest resident butterfly, pays us a visit', 'author': 'Nic Wilson', 'datePublished': '2023-06-12 10:09:43', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561908', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d1faecfb8cb64d7cacb78e3c9c47fdcc13949337/0_80_2400_1440/500.jpg', 'body': 'I’m crouched in a grassy hollow, chatting to my friend Steve about the ethics of watching a pair of dingy skippers in flagrante, when a visitor arrives out of the blue, distracting us from our moral quandary.

We’re here to spot butterflies, but we weren’t expecting such a rare treasure to seek us out. It is a male small blue, the UK’s tiniest resident butterfly, with a wingspan barely bigger than my thumbnail. Once known as the Bedford blue on account of a large population near that town, its Latin name – Cupido minimus – is surely the most endearing of binomials. When this littlest love closes its wings, it reveals a frosted underside similar to that of a holly blue, with a freckling of black dots almost too minute to discern with the naked eye. Despite the species’ local abundance in the 19th century in chalky areas where kidney vetch (its sole larval foodplant) grows, numbers declined significantly as a result of habitat loss from agricultural intensification and lack of sympathetic management. By the early 2000s, the small blue was thought to be extinct in Hertfordshire. But contrary to the national trend of diminishing distribution, several populations have been discovered in the county over the last 20 years, and the Hertfordshire and Middlesex branch of Butterfly Conservation has been working with landowners to promote awareness of the species’ importance and support the conservation of known colonies. I spent many happy hours last June in a meadow on the edge of Letchworth Garden City watching small blues congregate in the late afternoon, prior to communal roosting.

Nicola Shaw, who joined from National Grid last year, will receive share awards worth £1.3m from the energy network operator next month under a long-term incentive plan initiated in 2020, according to its annual report released last week. The award – worth about double the payout she declined – threatens to undermine her decision last month to forgo her bonus at Yorkshire Water. Gary Carter, the national officer at the GMB union, said: “Nicola Shaw painted herself as a martyr for giving up her Yorkshire Water bonus, despite the fact she was set to trouser more than a million quid in share options from a previous job. “It’s hard to know where she gets the nerve, especially while many water workers are struggling to make ends meet. Refusing a bonus, while pocketing a fortune in the background, makes for a pretty hollow act of contrition.” Shaw joined the chief executives of Thames Water and South West Water in publicly stating on the same day last month that they would refuse their bonuses, amid widespread criticism of water companies’ pollution records. She later said: “I get why people are angry – seeing sewage in our rivers and seas isn’t right. We should have a system that befits the 21st century. So, on behalf of Yorkshire Water, I am sorry. We should have acted more quickly to change the situation. “That’s why I have decided to refuse any bonus this year, as I want us to make progress.” Her bonus at Yorkshire Water would have been between £600,000 and £800,000, on top of her £574,000 salary. The company also agreed to pay expenses of “up to £140,000” for Shaw to relocate to Yorkshire. The company declined to answer questions over how much of this sum she had taken. Shaw was granted “good leaver” status by National Grid on resigning from her role as executive director “given her overall long-term strong performance and contribution to the business”, meaning she was entitled to the share awards. She received a separate share award from the energy company worth about £1.8m last year and picked up £152,000 in fees and benefits for her role on the board of British Airways owner IAG. Last week, the Guardian reported that Thames Water had been accused of conducting a “flimsy PR stunt” over its chief executive, Sarah Bentley, shunning her bonus, as the company will soon report that she received £726,000 in extra payments on top of her £750,000 salary. The daughter of a stockbroker, Shaw worked her way up the transport industry and was chief executive of the £6.2bn High Speed One rail line for five years until 2016. She received a CBE for services to transport in the Queen’s New Year Honours in 2016. She spent six years at National Grid, receiving a pay packet of more than £2m in her final year. Water companies have been repeatedly condemned for dumping raw sewage into Britain’s rivers and seas. Last month, some firms apologised and said they planned to invest £10bn to reduce spills of overflowing sewage into England’s waterways. However, they were quickly pilloried for passing the bill on to customers. Yorkshire Water said: “Any payment that Nicola Shaw will receive from National Grid relates solely to and was earned during her time there, has been fully disclosed and is completely unrelated to her work at Yorkshire Water. “Nicola’s decision not to accept any bonus from Yorkshire Water this year was due solely to her strength of feeling about river health and to show her commitment to improving the company’s performance. “This decision was made out of principle and was made before the financial results had even been completed or any decision by the independent remuneration committee on what a bonus might have been.” Shaw’s former boss, National Grid’s chief executive, John Pettigrew, was criticised last week for receiving a pay bump to more than £7m as households struggle to pay their energy bills.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a960', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/11/farm-to-school-local-food', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘A gastronomic experience’: the US schools serving local veggies and edible flowers over frozen food', 'lead': 'With locally grown Valencia oranges, watermelon radish and broccolini, kids enjoy nutritious meals – while small farmers and the community also benefit', 'author': 'Victoria Namkung in Los Angeles', 'datePublished': '2023-06-11 12:00:52', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561959', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/fafc295c764f8b6875a22a81235ada960093dd2d/0_0_3000_1800/500.jpg', 'body': 'Mature grapefruit and avocado trees line one side of Magnolia elementary school in sunny Upland, California, a small city about half an hour east of Los Angeles. About 120 students participate in the school’s garden club where, in addition to learning about gardening and farming, they enjoy the literal fruits of their labor when their food is harvested and served in Upland unified school district cafeterias. “It helps them understand the produce they’re seeing in the salad bar,” says Upland unified’s farm-to-school manager, Cassidy Furnari. Thanks to an increased interest in local foods, farm-to-school programs and school gardens in recent years, some school meals are looking a lot different from the frozen and processed foods that have been associated with school cafeterias for generations. Advocates say serving fresh and local foods increases students’ access to and consumption of nutritious foods and improves school meal quality and participation rates – benefits that are more important than ever as American children face a hunger crisis due to the expiration of pandemic-era programs. According to the USDA’s 2019 farm-to-school census, about 43 million children participate in farm-to-school programs every year, and nearly 68,000 schools feature local foods on their menu. Districts like Upland are setting new standards for school meals, sourcing from local growers and bakeries, taking field trips to farms, and hosting monthly taste tests of produce such as candy cane beets and rainbow carrots so students can expand their palates. “The pandemic played a role,” says Upland unified’s nutrition services director, Ksenia Glenn, of the district’s shift to local foods. “We wanted to diversify our supply chain, but I think more than that we wanted to support local farmers and get the freshest, most delicious food grown here in the Inland Empire.” California is leading efforts to build a healthy, equitable and more resilient food system through its universal free school meals program. In October, the USDA announced it had signed a cooperative agreement with the state of California for more than $23m to increase the purchase of local foods, which the agency defines as food that’s produced in state or less than 400 miles (640km) away. And in November, the California department of food and agriculture announced $25.5m in funding for 120 farm-to-school projects across the state as part of the California farm-to-school incubator grant program. Upland unified is a grantee, receiving $69,500 from the program to build additional school gardens; grow culturally relevant fruits, vegetables and herbs in the gardens; and hire educators. The benefits of school cafeterias going local are numerous. Food travels fewer miles and requires less time in storage. Farm-to-school programs often work with regenerative producers who use climate-smart agricultural practices. Buying locally improves racial justice by promoting marginalized farmers and ranchers – who tend to own small and mid-size farms – and increases food security via healthier school meals. By procuring local products, schools are also increasing economic resilience in their own communities. “What really helps farming families are anchor partners who order week after week in pallet-size quantities,” says Anna Knight, a fifth-generation farmer at Old Grove Orange who supplies the Upland school district with produce such as pre-sliced cantaloupe, valencia oranges and organic watermelon radish – all picked within 24 hours of delivery. “Not only do we get to survive as farmers, but we get to have kids having a gastronomic experience.” Old Grove Orange hosts mini farmers’ markets on Upland unified campuses and welcomes students to its farm so they know what their farmer looks like and where their food comes from. Upland schools also receive produce from the Riverside Food Hub, which represents 19 farmers, including 16 Bipoc farmers. In San Bernardino county, where Upland is located, more than 18%, or 104,370 children, are food insecure, with a lack of consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. A Columbia University evaluation found that schools that offered hands-on activities such as gardening and cooking had students who ate three times as many fruits and vegetables compared with students without those opportunities. “Farm-fresh, local foods can improve school meal quality, meal participation rates, climate impact and local economic development,” says Nick Anicich, farm-to-school program manager for the state of California. “By shortening supply chains, farm-to-school programs can also create more resilient local food systems that are less impacted by supply chain challenges.” During the pandemic, the Long Beach unified school district said its farm-to-school vendors were the only ones with a 100% delivery rate during the supply chain disruption. The Vacaville unified school district had the same experience. “The only people we could depend on during Covid were the local vendors,” said Vacaville’s director of student nutrition, Juan Cordon. Vacaville unified is focused on serving made-from-scratch local and organic food for its 18 schools, and even brought in a chef to teach kitchen staff how to prepare new dishes. “We buy just like if we’re going to the farmers’ market – we see what’s local and fresh and what tastes good,” said Cordon. “We’re seeing students excited about fruits and vegetables.” By sourcing from Spork Food Hub, which works with 30 Sacramento area farmers and ranchers and is also an incubator program grantee, Vacaville unified receives produce such as blackberries, raspberries, broccolini, peaches and squash – all harvested within 72 hours of delivery. “It’s fresher, there’s less of a carbon footprint and you’re contributing to the local economy,” said Cordon. Vacaville unified is now building a central kitchen without freezers to meet its goal of having no frozen proteins. Current menu offerings include steel-cut oatmeal with fruit, a farmers’ market scramble, an organic chicken wrap with house-made ranch in a whole grain tortilla, and black bean tamales with corn masa made by a local vendor. “Over the last decade we’ve seen how our food systems are hijacked by massive corporations and we see it in the school system, too,” said Alice Reznickova, an interdisciplinary scientist with the food and environment program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Relocalizing where schools get their food means the school meals will be more nutritious and there are other co-benefits.” Reznickova said that while local and regional chains are important, there are differences in what kind of produce is available throughout the year – and the climate crisis is increasing the intensity of floods, droughts and hurricanes, all of which affect local food systems. She said that accessing a wide variety of local foods in California may be easy, but that isn’t the case everywhere. “Any program has to be flexible because the US is such a large country and we have such a variety of climates and products,” she said. “Any federal policy or local guidelines have to account for this flexibility.” While Upland students may have more access to local foods than districts in other climate zones, it’s clear that the local movement within their district goes beyond having tastier or fresher options. “Students understand how much goes into growing produce and they have a greater understanding and respect for how hard it is to be a farmer,” said Upland’s farm-to-school manager Furnari. “Our goal is that students are understanding more of the food system – it’s a continuation of the classroom.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a961', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/11/things-not-going-well-plan-to-return-cheetahs-to-india-under-fire-after-six-die-within-months', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Things not going well’: plan to return cheetahs to India under fire after six die within months', 'lead': 'Project to reintroduce big cat to the wild set back by loss of adults and cubs at reserve', 'author': 'Robin McKie', 'datePublished': '2023-06-11 09:00:47', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561977', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0397e2a2028cbfe910cf4d81b29c3931d81ccbf2/0_3_5500_3299/500.jpg', 'body': 'A controversial attempt to reintroduce cheetahs to the wild has suffered a major setback after three adults and three cubs died over the past eight months. The deaths have led to criticisms of Project Cheetah, a £4.8m international scheme that involved moving 20 animals from Africa to India’s Kuno National Park earlier this year. Some conservationists say not enough space was reserved for the cheetahs while others complained that the project was set up too hastily. However, project scientists insisted that several fatalities were to be expected at the start of the project, and forecast that the death toll would stabilise in the near future. “If you are going to reintroduce an animal to the wild, you have to do it very carefully,” said Professor Sarah Durant, of the Zoological Society of London. “And it is clear that things are not going well. The programme seems rushed.” Cheetahs are the world’s fastest land animals and can run at speeds of up to 65mph. There are five subspecies and all have suffered major drops in numbers caused by climate change, hunting by humans and habitat destruction. As a result, surviving populations of East African, South African and Northeast African cheetahs are now vulnerable, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The other two – the Northwest African cheetah and the Asiatic cheetah – are critically endangered. India’s own population of cheetahs – made up of the Asiatic subspecies – was wiped out last century, with the last documented native animals being shot by Maharajah Ramanuj Singh Deo in 1947. The Asian cheetah now survives only in Iran. By contrast, there are about 6,500 African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), and there have been successes in restoring numbers in semi-managed wildlife reserves in South Africa. With the eradication of its own cheetahs, India launched efforts to re-establish a population using the Southern African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus). However, these moves were blocked, initially, by the Indian supreme court, where it was argued that because it was not a native species, its introduction broke international conservation regulations. In 2020, the court’s ruling was overturned and Project Cheetah was launched with considerable fanfare, including support from the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The first animals – eight cheetahs that had been relocated from Namibia – arrived at Kuno last September, and 12 more were moved from South Africa in February. However, by late May this year, three of the Kuno cheetahs and three newborn cubs had died . Two adults succumbed to organ failure and a third was killed in a violent mating encounter. The cause of the deaths of the cubs is unclear at present. While cubs in the wild have poor survival rates owing to predation from lions and hyenas, those born in protected reserves have high survival rates. The deaths of the three adults were not unexpected given the high stress of relocation, said Adrian Tordiffe, a veterinarian at South Africa’s University of Pretoria and a consultant for the project, in the journal Nature. “The fact that we had multiple deaths occurring in a short space of time is not unusual in the sense that it’s the high-risk period. Once things stabilise, that will plateau.” However, Prof Durant was more critical. “Kuno is a relatively small park and does not have a great deal of prey for cheetahs to hunt,” she said. “In some cases, that will lead cheetahs to roam outside the park. That has happened but it seemed to take the authorities by surprise. A reintroduction of a large carnivore like a cheetah should have been supported by an extensive community engagement programme ahead of any release. “Any country that re-introduces a large carnivore deserves to be applauded,” she added. “However, there does seem to be an excessive number of losses at Kuno, and they seem to be happening in circumstances in which I would not expect there to be losses like these. So I think there needs to be a rethink of how they’re managing Cheetah Project and a halt to future re-introductions for the moment.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a962', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/10/risk-record-heatwave-uk-twice-normal-forecasters-40c-meteorologists', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Risk of hot summer in UK is more than twice normal figure, forecasters warn', 'lead': 'There are no signs yet that last year’s 40C will be breached again, but meteorologists predict such peaks could become the norm', 'author': 'Robin McKie Science editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-10 14:24:50', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.561994', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/84eccfa945e0e0c387e319d347a97d2bb8ccbec7/607_711_5034_3021/500.jpg', 'body': 'Temperatures have soared above 30C for the first time this year – and meteorologists forecast the chance of Britain experiencing a hot summer is now 45% – 2.3 times the normal figure. The warning leaves the nation braced for a possible repeat of last year’s record-breaking heatwave which triggered wildfires, disrupted rail transport, closed schools, led to thousands of premature deaths and saw temperatures break the 40C record in the UK for the first time. Whether Britain will again experience a breach of the 40C level remains unclear, however. “There’s no strong indications for it,” said Mark Bevan, a senior Met Office adviser. “On the other hand, we saw it last year, so it’s obviously inherently possible. So never say never.” Bevan said the coming summer’s weather prospects had been calculated using a number of factors including the El Niño effect, wind patterns and sea surface temperatures: “If the wind comes predominantly from the north, that would cool the weather. If the sea surface temperature is high, that acts a bit like an electric blanket for the country.” Based on these factors, forecasters say there is a 5% chance the weather will be cool this summer and a 45% chance it will be hot, the latter figure being 2.3 times higher than normal. Even if Britain does not experience 40C temperatures this year, it is clear there will be increasing numbers of heatwaves in the near future, with damaging consequences. At temperatures of over 35C even healthy people suffer effects, especially those who have to work outdoors. For the elderly and those living with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, the impact is worse. A joint report by the Office for National Statistics and the UK Health Security Agency revealed that last year there had been 3,000 more deaths in England and Wales than would usually be expected in the summer. Crucially most extra deaths occurred in the over-65s and during the heatwave’s hottest days in late July. Night temperatures pose an additional problem, added Bevan. “If you get very hot days but cool evenings, people can recover a bit. But if the temperature never dips below 20C at night, that becomes a real problem.” Forest fires are another concern, with outbreaks already causing devastation this year. Half of the RSPB’s Corrimony nature reserve near Loch Ness was destroyed by a massive blaze earlier this month. “I should be seeing black grouse and curlew chicks emerging from their nests now but there is just charred landscape,” said site manager Simon McLaughlin. “Other wildlife such as adders, lizards and frogs had no time to escape either. It will take hundreds of thousands of pounds to restore this habitat.” Bevan summed up the national situation: “Last year was the UK’s warmest on record and that has really focused everybody’s attention on the impact of heat. The 2022 heatwave disrupted transport, the emergency services, power supplies and people’s health and we now realise these are impacts that will have to be dealt with regularly in coming years,” he said. The prime driver of this meteorological chaos is carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas that is being pumped into the atmosphere by cars, factories and power plants at increasing rates. Between 1960 and 1970 carbon dioxide levels grew at a rate of around 1 part per million (ppm). Now, they are rising by about 2.37ppm per year. In 1965, carbon dioxide levels were 320ppm. This year they have topped 420ppm. At this rate, the world will soon have heated by more than 1.5C since pre-industrial levels, a temperature that was supposed to be the upper acceptable limit for global warming. In fact, the world could heat by almost 3C by the end of the century, triggering the melting of ice caps, the death of coral reefs and rising ocean levels. For its part, Britain will experience weather patterns that will become increasingly grim, a point stressed by a study published last week by an international team led by Bath University researchers. It predicts that peak summer temperatures of 41C and weekly averages of 28C will be normal in large parts of southern England towards the end of the century. These figures compare with maximum peaks of 31C and averages of 20C that occurred in the 1970s. Temperature rises on this scale emphasise the urgent need to make radical changes in infrastructure and underline the problems facing the UK, said Prof David Coley of Bath University. “The average temperature difference between London and Nice is only 5C – but those two places are totally different in terms of how people live, the plants around them, the buildings they create and how prepared they are for heatwaves,” he said. This point was backed by Bob Ward, the policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change. “It is clear that the UK is dangerously unprepared for the growing intensity and frequency of heatwaves, which are damaging lives and livelihoods across the country. “The government is due to publish imminently a new plan for adapting the country to the impacts of climate change. It absolutely must include a national heat risk strategy that focuses on preventing overheating in buildings rather than just dealing with the health consequences of homes that become deathtraps in hot weather.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a963', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/10/local-food-microfarms-equity', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Everything is natural and tastes so good’: microfarms push back against ‘food apartheid’', 'lead': 'Bipoc-led local farms in unconventional spaces decentralize systems that have produced food deserts and create food equity', 'author': 'Victoria Namkung in Los Angeles', 'datePublished': '2023-06-10 14:00:23', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562012', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/3efcdf6ce1491a78dd37459626f5dabe9d41fa9a/0_0_3000_1800/500.jpg', 'body': 'On a recent Sunday morning in South Los Angeles, Crop Swap LA volunteers and staffers harvested bags of freshly picked produce from the front yard of a residence. Located just steps from Leimert Park Plaza, Asante Microfarm is the first of what will be numerous microfarms created by the organization, which is dedicated to growing hyperlocal food on unused spaces “in the neighborhood, exclusively for the neighborhood”. “Everything we’re growing is nutrient-dense and the food remains in the neighborhood,” says Jamiah Hargins, who founded Crop Swap LA in 2018 as a small monthly swap of surplus produce. After spending years in finance and consulting, Hargins decided to create a local food distribution system to address the fact that his neighborhood was a food desert, meaning most residents have little access to healthy food. It’s now one of many Bipoc-led groups across the US that are reclaiming their agricultural heritage and redefining the local food movement by growing on traditional farms and unconventional spaces such as yards, medians and vacant lots as a way to increase food security and health in their own communities. Crop Swap LA members live within one mile of one of the organization’s microfarms and receive their weekly bags of produce within hours of harvest – which Hargins says is far more nutritious than buying produce that’s been sitting on trucks or in storage for days and weeks – for $60 (£50) a month (Cal Fresh/EBT users pay $25). The solar-powered microfarms feature on-site composting and rainwater harvesting, and plants are grown in long mesh containers made from upcycled polypropylene. Harvests have included Swiss chard, tomatoes, red-veined sorrel and pattypan summer squash, among other produce and herbs. A fruit tree harvesting program provides members with honey crisp apples and Asian pears. Crop Swap LA’s third microfarm will debut its first harvest in June and its biggest project yet will be an urban farm that will provide produce for a 10,000 sq ft food incubator and grocery store at the forthcoming Marlton Square development in south Los Angeles’s Baldwin Hills neighborhood. The local food movement has long been led by white upper-class activists, such as Michael Pollan and Alice Waters, which means the needs of diverse communities have often been neglected and the systemic racism that affects the US food system is often ignored. “Some of the communities that have been systematically kept away from good food are realizing that they can get involved,” says Hargins, who will introduce workshops and training programs next year so others can replicate his group’s efforts. “Our movement here is about refreshing the whole system, which ends up decentralizing food and creating more equity.” Naomi Adams, who researches environmental justice at University of California, Los Angeles, says the movement of people growing their own food is gaining momentum and that having autonomy is an imperative for food sovereignty. “It’s empowering to grow food in your own back yard and not have to rely on these food market systems that don’t care about these communities at all – they have no interest in actually supporting communities in need,” says Adams. Adams notes that the term “food desert” isn’t entirely accurate since it makes areas sound barren and isn’t reflective of what’s actually going on in neighborhoods. Adams prefers using the term “food apartheid”, which describes the system of racist policies that limit access to healthy food in communities. Even those experiencing food apartheid can still be part of the local food movement, Adams says, whether growing food in a garden or traveling farther afield to access fresh produce. Adams says that a person’s relationship with food – in addition to their awareness and ability to harvest resources around them – results in how and what they eat. “It matters where people live, but it’s not the be-all and end-all,” they say. “There are many ways to be resilient in the face of food apartheid.” South Los Angeles resident Tanya Hayley was taking her son for a haircut when she happened to drive by Crop Swap LA’s second microfarm, La Salle, which opened last year. After learning about its mission, Hayley became a member and has since enjoyed Sunday deliveries of grapefruits, oranges, kumquats, red lettuce and herb bundles. “You can tell that everything is natural and it tastes so good,” she says. “I cooked the kale and my son was hovering over the bowl – and he never eats kale.” There are similar groups run by communities of color across the US. After the Chicora-Cherokee community in North Charleston, South Carolina, was left without a grocery store for more than 10 years, Fresh Future Farm stepped in. Founded in 2014, the non-profit transformed a vacant lot into a flourishing urban farm that grows bananas, sugarcane, meyer lemons, satsuma oranges, collard greens, okra and tomatoes, among other crops. Two years later, it opened a sliding scale grocery store on the same property – the first one in the area in 11 years. “Everything we sell from the farm space is harvested to order,” says Fresh Future Farm co-director Tamazha North. “We’re really a necessity for folks to access food.” The non-profit also teaches home gardening classes, which is inspiring a new crop of home growers. “Our dream is to have farms and stores in every neighborhood experiencing food insecurity,” says North. In New York’s lower Hudson valley, Rise &amp; Root Farm is a 5-acre ( 3-hectare) cooperative run by four multiracial LGBTQ+ women. In addition to selling a wide variety of seedlings and plants, their mission is centered on the healing power of food and farming to build a more equitable food system. “It’s a sense of pride when you grow your own food and it’s passing on knowledge, storytelling, culture and education,” says co-owner and farmer Karen Washington, a longtime urban gardener who helped transform empty lots in the Bronx into community gardens. “For so long, the food movement has definitely been white-led. We’re trying to reclaim our culture and heritage when it comes to farming and food.” Washington, who was awarded the James Beard leadership award in 2014 for her work, says it’s important to remember that the US and its food system were “built on the backs” of enslaved Black and Indigenous people. In the US, 95% of farmers are white, while Black, Indigenous and other people of color often encounter challenges when it comes to securing capital, land, credit and infrastructure. In the last 100 years, the number of Black farmers in the US fell from nearly 1 million to 45,000, and Black farmers receive the lowest amount of loans, according to an NPR analysis of USDA data. “We’re trying to make sure that young Black and brown children understand their place in agriculture and in the food system,” says Washington. “Their ancestors came from an agrarian culture and they can embrace it, too.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a964', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/10/epa-pesticide-toxic-seeds-lawsuit-environment-pollution', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'EPA sued over pesticide-coated seeds’ ‘devastating impacts’ on US wildlife', 'lead': 'Environmental groups’ lawsuit seeks to force tighter regulation of neonicotinoids on seeds that pollute soil, water and air', 'author': 'Tom Perkins', 'datePublished': '2023-06-10 11:00:20', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562030', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/5e61a3e0c2a014d48f8efc821da2b77d7cae0d72/0_109_4000_2400/500.jpg', 'body': 'Environmental groups are suing the US Environmental Protection Agency over pesticide-coated seeds they say have “devastating environmental impacts” and are spread largely without regulatory oversight. The suit alleges the neonicotinoid seeds are now spread on about 150m acres (61m hectares) of US farmland and up to 95% of the pesticide on the seed sheds, polluting nearby soil, water and air. The seeds are so dangerous to wildlife that just one can kill a bird, the groups note. “They are highly toxic to pollinators, insects, birds, aquatic organisms that build the base of our food chain,” said Amy von Saun, an attorney with the Center for Food Safety (CFS), a co-plaintiff in the lawsuit. “Because the seeds represent so much neonicotinoid use, this is where all the devastation is coming from.” The CFS is a co-plaintiff in the suit with Pesticide Action Network North America. Neonicotinoids are a controversial class of chemicals used in insecticides widely spread on cropland to treat for pests, but which a growing body of science has found harms pollinators and other insects not targeted by the chemical. Neonicotinoids work by destroying an insect’s nerve synapse, causing uncontrollable shaking, paralysis and death. While neonicotinoids can be sprayed on cropland, about 95% of it is distributed via seeds. The chemicals are water soluble and easily leach into soils and streams, and clouds of neonicotinoid-laced dust released during seed plantings have caused mass bee die-offs, the groups say. Neonicotinoids from three major producers affect about 75% of all endangered species, the EPA recently found, and the UN reported cropland is now about 50 times more toxic than just a quarter of a century ago, contributing to an “insect apocalypse”. The chemicals are so destructive that the European Union banned their outdoor use while Canada has also imposed restrictions. Among the issues at the center of the lawsuit is the seeds’ minimal and unenforceable labeling. The suit asks a judge to compel the agency to require stronger and enforceable labeling. The suit also challenges the EPA’s exemption of the seeds from registration as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (Fifra). Registration would trigger closer scrutiny of their environmental and health impacts, and force the EPA to weigh the seeds’ benefits against their costs. The agency would have to show the seeds do not cause unreasonable or adverse effects to the environment, as is the standard under Fifra. EPA science has found neonicotinoids harm endangered species while providing little benefit in terms of crop yield. “If you actually balance the benefit against the harms, it would not pass the Fifra test,” von Saun said. However, the EPA has claimed it has already thoroughly studied neonicotinoids and does not need to conduct reviews of the seed. The CFS in 2017 petitioned the Trump EPA to re-examine its exemption for the seeds and ban them. The EPA ignored the petition until CFS sued in 2021 to force a response, and months later the Biden EPA denied the petition. The new case challenges that denial as unlawful. “Because coated seeds have significant adverse effects on the environment, EPA cannot continue to avoid its duty to review, balance the costs and benefits, and mitigate harm by unilaterally exempting coated seeds from FIFRA,” the suit states.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a965', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/10/greta-thunberg-last-school-strike-for-climate', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Greta Thunberg takes part in her last school strike for climate', 'lead': 'As activist graduates from school, she says she will still protest on Fridays as ‘fight has only just begun’', 'author': 'Tobi Thomas', 'datePublished': '2023-06-10 10:36:21', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562048', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/51a29737be7c74aeb342950f3b17558d10a04e6e/0_64_4029_2420/500.jpg', 'body': 'After what began as a solo protest in Sweden five years ago and grew into a movement with millions of children across the world participating, Greta Thunberg has taken part in her last “school strike” protest as she graduates from school. The protests, which led to many climate activist movements across Europe, the US and Australia, are known as Fridays for Future or School Strike for Climate. Thunberg tweeted: “Today, I graduate from school, which means I’ll no longer be able to school strike for the climate. This is then the last school strike for me, so I guess I have to write something on this day. “When I started striking in 2018 I could never have expected that it would lead to anything. After striking every day for three weeks, we were a small group of children who decided to continue doing this every Friday. And we did, which is how Fridays for Future was formed. “Some more people joined, and quite suddenly this was a global movement growing every day. During 2019, millions of youth striked from school for the climate, flooding the streets in over 180 countries. When the pandemic started, we had to find new ways to protest. She added: “We who can speak up have a duty to do so. In order to change everything, we need everyone. I’ll continue to protest on Fridays, even though it’s not technically ‘school striking’. We simply have no other option than to do everything we possibly can. The fight has only just begun.” Thunberg has become a household name known for her climate activism, and has addressed world leaders about the climate emergency at the United Nations’ climate action summit. In 2019, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Thunberg said the growth of the school strike movement was “an amazing feeling”. “To feel that you’re a part of something bigger, and that you can be a part of a movement that has so much impact on the world,” Thunberg said. “It’s an amazing feeling and I wish more people could feel like that.” When asked whether the movement could bring about a zero-carbon policy change, Thunberg said: “Of course not. It’s not going to take a million children skipping school. There isn’t one solution which is going to solve everything. We are trying to change the conversation and I think we have accomplished a lot.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a966', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/10/ministers-biodiversity-targets-tony-juniper-natural-england-chair', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Ministers warned England set to miss wildlife and biodiversity targets', 'lead': 'Exclusive: Natural England chair Tony Juniper says government must work quickly to reconcile farming and nature', 'author': 'Helena Horton Environment reporter', 'datePublished': '2023-06-10 06:00:14', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562065', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/a6b43e178bad8fecee7b8cf4f1e3bb545034d018/0_97_5472_3283/500.jpg', 'body': 'England will not meet its biodiversity targets at current rates, the chair of Natural England has said, as he accused ministers of moving too slowly to regenerate nature. Tony Juniper, who has been in post at the government’s nature quango since 2019, said ministers were not on track to meet species abundance targets, which have been criticised by wildlife charities as “embarrassingly poor”. The government has set a legally binding target to halt the decline in species abundance by 2030 and committed to increasing the abundance of wildlife by 10% by 2042 compared with 2030 levels. Juniper said: “We’re not moving with the speed that will be needed to meet the 2030 species target. And we’re going to have to work much harder to be able to do that.” He said ministers needed to work quickly to be able to fix the conflicts between farming and nature. “This is about reconciling, again, some really quite complicated conundrums, including how, for example, we can maintain a high level of domestic food production at the same time as bringing wildlife back into the landscape,” he said. “And some of this is about policy. Some of it is about knowledge. Some of it is about culture. It’s a transition that can be made. But it does need to go more quickly than presently is the case if we’re going to meet those 2030 targets.” Juniper has come under fire from nature campaigners in recent weeks for continuing with a trial scheme to protect hen harriers. The most controversial part of the trial is taking the eggs or chicks of some hen harriers nesting on grouse moors into captivity, rearing the birds to fledging age and releasing them back into the wild in the uplands of northern England. This is despite continued persecution of the birds, which have historically been killed by gamekeepers working for the grouse industry as they predate on game birds. Recent research by the RSPB has shown that persecution is still the main cause of death for hen harriers, with many killed shortly after fledging. The nature chief said he would continue with the trial to see if it worked, and that if persecution persisted he could advise ministers to clamp down on grouse shooting, licensing shoots in a similar way to the Scottish government. Juniper said: “The evidence suggests there is a continuing level of illegal persecution. And actually, not only is there illegal persecution, there is some really quite disturbing level of cruelty involved with this, with some of the instances of birds being pulled apart while they’re still alive, nests being destroyed deliberately. “That really does need to change if we’re going to see the hen harrier plan as a success. And if we don’t see it as a success, then we’ll need to do something else. And we’re very interested in the licensing discussion that’s going on in Scotland, and the extent to which that may inform the future here.” The release of beavers in England appears to be something Juniper is passionate about, with a Devon trial that ended in 2020 finding the rodents have huge benefits for the environment. They went extinct in the country from being hunted 400 years ago and have since been illegally released in small numbers by frustrated nature activists. Juniper suggested ministers were dragging their feet over allowing beavers to be let loose in the countryside, despite the evidence showing they were good for the environment. He said: “We have reached the conclusion of Natural England that it would be right to license beaver reintroductions into England. And that we’re confident that can be managed in a way which would minimise risks to infrastructure and food security and to property. So we’re awaiting decisions from ministers on that, it will be their decision. We need to be given a clear signal as to the approach ministers would like to adopt, we believe the evidence is clear as to the benefits of beavers.” Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, has ruled out the release of wolves and lynx. Juniper said: “I do welcome the raising of the profile of some of these discussions because what she did do was encouraged a discussion and led to people debating the pros and cons of these kinds of proposals. It may be quite a long time before we can look at wolf but certainly there’s many people now thinking about lynx, including in Scotland.” Another fierce debate raging in nature circles is over the right to roam. While some argue that people in England should enjoy similar access to nature as those in Scotland, who have free rein to roam the countryside – with some caveats – others fear it could lead to the trampling of sensitive habitat. Juniper suggested he did not agree with a complete right to roam. “I think being outside in the natural environment is a very important thing that is hugely beneficial for people,” he said. “But I do believe that we need to be careful about other interests that we need to maintain at the same time as public health, including the protection of sensitive nature, which might be disturbed by dogs or by people who have the right to roam and not necessarily with a responsibility to protect. There’s a lot of complexity in that.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a967', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/10/country-diary-the-carrot-cousin-thats-pretty-but-deadly', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: The carrot cousin that’s pretty but deadly | Jim Perrin', 'lead': '<strong>Harlech, Gwynedd:</strong> At the boundary of a wood I find some hemlock water dropwort, of which every part is poisonous', 'author': 'Jim Perrin', 'datePublished': '2023-06-10 04:30:12', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562085', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/f5a0dc2020e16ada9f40efd4d7cb1188b78dc029/0_224_4900_2941/500.jpg', 'body': 'The path climbs slate steps before slanting left through oakwoods alive with the song of warblers.

I lean against a wall, look around, and down to my right in a moist ditch see a plant of which all who venture into the Welsh countryside should be very wary. It’s an umbellifer, less tall than hogweed. I check out crucial detail. White flower-clusters are already present. Stems are hairless and hollow, lacking purple blotches low down that would identify this specimen as Conium maculatum (hemlock). It’s Oenanthe crocata – hemlock water dropwort, deadliest of all British plants, every part of it very poisonous. A member of the carrot family, it has pale, tuberous roots – dead man’s finger. Foragers beware! I first encountered it when I lived in Cwm Pennant in the mid-1970s. Three friends who rented the small cottage of Tanygraig used to call for tea at my house up-valley. They were pleasant idealists, committed to an alternative lifestyle, living as much as possible “off the land”. They gathered some of those tubers from the riverbank, grated them into a salad, served it up with sorrel and dandelion and ate it with home-baked bread. Later that evening they fell violently ill. All three were taken to hospital in Bangor. Seeing this isolated specimen at the margin of an Eryri wood reminds me of Plato’s account of the death of Socrates in 399BC. He was found guilty by an Athenian court of impiety and of corrupting youth through his teachings.

It’s an experience that will be mirrored across the country in the coming weeks as fire authorities and land managers carry out hundreds of controlled burns. Climate change has already lengthened Australia’s fire seasons, with higher temperatures driving an increase in riskier fire weather. And with the landscape full of fuel after three wet La Niña summers, the risk of severe bushfires may rise if the predicted El Niño is realised, bringing hot and dry conditions. “It’s uncharted territory if we get a big El Niño,” says Greg Mullins, the former New South Wales fire commissioner. The three years of wet weather has also meant three years of reduced hazard reduction burning, he says. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Mullins was volunteering as a deputy incident controller for a planned hazard reduction burn last week across 400 hectares of Ku-ring-gai Chase national park, north of Sydney. Hazard reduction burns can take place in forest understorey, grasslands and savannahs. Land managers and fire authorities prioritise areas close to communities or known spots where large fires can start, including along roadsides where the risks of accidental ignition from the public are highest. But authorities also need the right weather – not too windy, not too hot and not too wet. “As soon as you have a weather window, you jump on it,” says Mullins. “The windows for hazard reduction are much shorter now, because the hot weather starts earlier. “Whenever there’s an opportunity you’re going to find national parks, fire services will all be out there burning whatever they can.” In New South Wales, the Rural Fire Service (NSW RFS) and partner agencies have managed 58,591 hectares of controlled burns since last July to protect 93,523 properties – just 20% of what was proposed. But 33,000 of those hectares were burned in the last month. Last week, 6,876 hectares of burns were earmarked around the Blue Mountains, Tenterfield, Coffs Harbour, the far south coast and Gunnedah. “People won’t have been smelling the smoke for the last few years,” says Inspector Ben Shepherd, of the NSW RFS. “But as soon as opportunities present, we need to get in there ahead of the next fire season.” “We know reducing the fuel reduces the intensity of bushfires,” he says. Some areas targeted for burns are close to urban areas and inevitably the smoke affects people, he says, although steps are taken to reduce exposure. Smoke from controlled burns can be terrifying for Australia’s 2.7 million asthma sufferers. “Bushfire smoke has high concentrations of small particles that travel into airways and trigger a response. The airways narrow,” says Michele Goldman, the chief executive of Asthma Australia. “That’s a pretty frightening experience for a young child, an older person or anyone with asthma.” ‘We just want people to be ready’ As well as a possible El Niño, climate models suggest the Indian Ocean could enter a phase in coming months that raises the chances of drier weather for much of the country. The bushfires of 2019-20 came after years of intense drought. Mullins and Shepherd say they do not expect another black summer this year because of the amount of moisture still in soils and plants. “We’re not coming out of drought, but we also don’t want people to underestimate the potential for fires. We just want people to be ready,” Shepherd says. Last week Brisbane woke to smoke haze after controlled burns in a section of the D’Aguilar national park on the city’s outskirts. The state’s fire season generally starts in August – earlier than southern states. James Haig, the executive manager for bushfire mitigation at the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, says he has been talking to Bureau of Meteorology forecasters “several times a day” to find windows for burning. “If we’ve got the chance of an El Niño then I’ve been encouraging our partners to seize the window of opportunity, because you don’t know what you are going to get. These windows can close very quickly.” Haig says firefighters accept that fire seasons are worsening. In Victoria, Alen Slijepcevic, the deputy chief fire officer at the Country Fire Authority, says the state has already conducted half its planned burns for this calendar year, but it is too early to know how much extra fuel will be in the landscape when the fire season starts around the end of August. But changing fire seasons mean firefighters and agencies “are more reactive most of the time” and have less time to take breaks. “It’s now a 12-month business, whereas in the past it was a six-month job for firies,” Slijepcevic says. “The evidence shows the fire season is 56 days longer in Victoria than it was 30 or 40 years ago.” In South Australia, the Country Fire Service says it is too early to know what summer might bring, but fuel is accumulating, particularly in the Adelaide Hills. In Tasmania, early autumn is usually the best time for burning, with more predictable weather, enough dryness and atmospheric conditions that help smoke rise and disperse. Jeremy Smith, the acting chief officer at Tasmania Fire Service, says: “The wet conditions in the eastern half of Tasmania have driven extraordinary growth in some of the state’s highest bushfire risk areas, increasing fuel loads and bushfire risk.” With drier conditions forecast, the fuel growth could lead to “above normal fire potential in some areas” in spring. If an El Niño were to form, this could extend into summer, Smith says. Last week, the Australian and New Zealand national council for fire and emergency services released its bushfire outlook for the winter showing large parts of the central Northern Territory were already facing increased fire risk. Nathaniel Staniford, acting senior fire management officer at Bushfires NT, says La Niña years have left “huge amounts of grass” that landholders are trying to reduce with controlled burns. In Western Australia, planned burns usually occur from April to November in the south of the state and from March to June in the north. But rainfall there has been relatively average for the past three years, with La Niña having less of an impact.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a969', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/09/canada-wildfire-smoke-climate-crisis', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Nowhere is safe now’: wildfire smoke brings climate crisis home to Americans', 'lead': 'With the Empire State Building and the Lincoln Memorial blotted out, the US is experiencing the climate catastrophe first-hand', 'author': 'Oliver Milman in New York', 'datePublished': '2023-06-09 14:00:55', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562134', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/f5ea1faca6cae7475113411072c862c1f8ba61c7/0_0_5842_3505/500.jpg', 'body': 'The unnerving sight of New York City’s skies turning a dystopian orange from wildfire smoke is just the latest in a barrage of recent distress signals that life in the US is starting to fray under the relentless pressure of the climate crisis, experts have warned. On Wednesday, New York held the dubious title of having the worst air quality in the world, with Detroit in second place, as plumes of smoke from hundreds of fires in Ontario and Quebec were carried south by a stiff breeze. Toxic air warnings affected more than 110 million Americans across a dozen states as a sort of demonic tangerine pall engulfed major east coast cities, blotting out everything from the Empire State Building to the Lincoln Memorial. A meteorologist with the National Weather Service noted that his town in upstate New York “looks like Mars”. It was the worst ever day for wildfire air pollution in recent US history and, as Joe Biden put it, “another stark reminder of the impacts of climate change”. New Yorkers are not unused to climate-driven disasters, but this felt disturbingly abnormal. Eric Adams, the city’s mayor, said his first reaction to the Blade Runner-like skies was “What the hell is this?” Playgrounds were shut down, Broadway theater actors fled the stage, baseball games were called off and previously discarded pandemic masks were suddenly clamped back on to faces. “There’s no blueprint or playbook for these type of issues,” Adams admitted. “You want to be as prepared as possible. But there is no planning for an incident like this.” The climate crisis’s subversion of life’s expected patterns has become a recent theme in the US, however, with the past two weeks showing that global heating is imposing some painful boundaries across the span of the North American continent. State Farm, the US’s largest insurer, announced it will stop selling new home insurance policies in California, the world’s sixth largest economy, due to the “rapidly growing catastrophe exposure” posed by the state’s increasingly fierce wildfires which, like in Canada, are growing in intensity and size due to the tinderbox-like conditions caused by rising temperatures. A second insurer, Allstate, soon followed suit. The upending of the housing market in the US west, a region in the grip of a two-decade megadrought worsened by the climate crisis, was then furthered by Arizona’s decision last week to halt new homebuilding in the Phoenix area because it has run out of available groundwater. An era of untrammeled growth into the desert now appears to be ending. Jesse Keenan, an expert in climate adaptation at Tulane University, said that while progressive voters who throng the US north-east believe the climate emergency is a problem, most hadn’t thought of it as a direct threat to their lives until recently, while those in the west now have to wrestle with a reality far more precarious, and costly, than they once considered. “The idea of retiring or escaping to sunny weather and living the good life is a fragile dream – nowhere is safe now,” Keenan said. “There are increasing costs of climate change that will be a lose-lose situation, affecting housing and financial wellness. This will only exacerbate inequalities as those with the best air conditioning and air filtration will do better than those who don’t. “People always knew living in the US south-west was extremely hard because of the lack of available water, but we had faith in our ability to engineer around Mother Nature,” he added. “That command and control over the environment worked for so long in a stable environment but we are now in an unstable environment. All the infrastructure we relied upon is now failing and there’s no going back.” Unwelcome climatic news keeps arriving – global greenhouse gas emissions are now at an all-time high, researchers have found, as are the temperatures of the world’s broiling oceans. Adding to this balmy stew is the prospect of a strong El Niño event, with scientists forecasting on Thursday that the periodic phenomenon that heightens global heat will probably strengthen throughout this year. Heatwaves, meanwhile, are scorching everywhere from Siberia to Puerto Rico. “Climate change isn’t a future problem or a distant one any more,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at the Nature Conservancy. “We’re breathing its impacts directly into our lungs today.” While most Americans – the largest consumers of energy in the world – aren’t quite yet prepared to give up their hulking SUVs, prodigious meat eating and capacious housing, about two-thirds say they are at least somewhat worried about global heating, according to recent polling by Yale University, and Biden has sold a climate agenda off the feelgood promise of millions of new jobs in renewable energy and electric car manufacturing. The plummeting cost of wind and solar power, growing uptake of zero-carbon cars and belated government action to tackle the climate crisis mean that “the problems are getting worse and the solutions are getting better,” according to Kate Marvel, a climate scientist at Nasa. “We live in the best of times and the worst of times,” she said. “We are really seeing climate impacts ramping up, with more fire weather, more floods and stronger storms, but we also have solutions that are increasingly viable. It’s important to hold both of these truths at the same time.” Marvel said that even while cutting planet-heating emissions to zero won’t result in immediate benefits to the climate, it will quickly lessen the toll of air pollution that regularly affects cities such as Delhi at levels similarly dire to what New York has just experienced. “If we make the climate better, it will make life better in general,” she said. “We are really starting to see the energy transition happening in the US – it’s not a question of whether it’s going to happen or not, it’s whether it will be fast enough and fair enough. That’s what we’ve still got to work out.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a96a', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/09/high-levels-drugs-water-pollution-study-england-south-coast', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'High levels of drugs found in sea off south England coast', 'lead': 'Study says marine life being harmed by prescription and recreational drugs in wastewater', 'author': 'Harriet Grant', 'datePublished': '2023-06-09 10:22:06', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562152', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d316d286858a29363027ed4a70db9b014af11c79/0_248_4134_2481/500.jpg', 'body': 'A study looking at water pollution on the south coast of England has revealed high levels of potentially harmful chemicals including recreational drugs and antidepressants. Scientists involved in the research say marine life is being harmed by human drugs, pointing to evidence that oestrogen in water can feminise male fish through biological changes. Bianca Carr, the co-founder of the Clean Harbour Partnership (CHP) that coordinated the work, said: “We need to go beyond talking about poo in the water – now we are looking at what’s in that human waste? Now we know the chemicals that are in it, the next step will be to look across the UK at what cocaine and other human drugs are doing to our water, to our food chain.” Campaigners in Hampshire and Sussex joined forces with Portsmouth and Brunel University London to analyse hundreds of water samples across Chichester and Langstone harbours. In more than 288 samples, researchers have so far detected more than 50 compounds across 22 sites. These include pharmaceuticals and diabetes medicines as well as a chemical produced by the liver after cocaine use. The team also discovered pesticides, including some that are banned in the UK. Prof Alex Ford, from the University of Portsmouth’s school of biological sciences, said: “We know there are billions of litres of sewage discharges annually around the UK but the impact of these discharges are not clearly understood. “This project is enabling us to determine what chemical contaminants are in our marine life and coastal waters. We have found a large variety of prescribed and illegal drugs plus a variety of pesticides in coastal waters and marine organisms, such as crabs and oysters. “This is important, because we know that aquatic ecosystems are under threat from pharmaceuticals and farming practices, such as biocides and fertilisers.” Ford has previously published research showing that even tiny quantities of antidepressants in water can affect wildlife, such as crustaceans and molluscs. Drugs will affect the behaviour and biological makeup of these creatures, including causing them to change colour or reproduce in a different way. Ford said: “There is a staggering list of prescription drugs passed from humans to wastewater treatment plants and into receiving streams, estuaries, or oceans by direct consumption, metabolism and excretion or by toilet flushing of old prescriptions. “The release of human pharmaceuticals into aquatic ecosystems is an environmental problem we should consider seriously.” The study also found E coli bacteria at high levels. A post-storm seawater sample taken from near an outflow pipe from Budds Farm sewage treatment works, near Langstone showed a reading of 380,000 colony forming units per 100ml of E coli, which is 760 times the safe levels set out under the European bathing water directive. The work is part of growing efforts around England’s coast to highlight the dangers of water pollution. CHP’s co-founder, Rob Bailey, said: “Thanks to community funding, we are starting to get an insight into the cocktail of chemicals polluting our seawater and their sources. Some pesticides seem to have been lingering for several years and the presence of partly digested antidepressants, drugs for type 2 diabetes and bladder infections is concerning. So little is known about their impact on marine life.” Campaigners have been highlighting the amount of sewage entering Britain’s seas in recent months. In April, figures from an analysis of Environment Agency data done by the Liberal Democrats showed that some popular beaches are affected particularly badly. At Meadfoot beach in Torquay, Devon, there were 79 dumps lasting 946 hours. Southern Water said removing chemical substances from wastewater was not asked for by the Environment Agency. The director of wastewater operations, John Penicud, said: “Tackling chemicals and impurities, especially ‘forever chemicals’, is a global challenge that requires close collaboration of industry, agriculture and other sectors, including water companies and regulators. “Our treatment processes already comply with stringent Environment Agency rules relating to the removal of contaminants, and we are working with partners to explore how we can go further – through the use of cutting-edge technology and science, and investing in our network to improve treatment.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a96b', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/09/193bn-of-fossil-fuels-imported-by-uk-from-authoritarian-states-in-year-since-ukraine-war', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '£19.3bn of fossil fuels imported by UK from authoritarian states in year since Ukraine war', 'lead': 'As Russian oil and gas imports fell petrostates including UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia increased exports to UK', 'author': 'Joey Grostern', 'datePublished': '2023-06-09 09:00:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562170', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/41dfead0198d97e48caab0c2623911d4231d8f7e/0_0_3000_1800/500.jpg', 'body': 'UK fossil fuel imports from authoritarian petrostates surged to £19.3bn in the year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it can be revealed. Efforts to end the purchasing of oil and gas from Russia appear to have resulted in a surge in imports from other authoritarian regimes, including Algeria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to data from the Office for National Statistics analysed by DeSmog. Last month the trade and business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, travelled to the Middle East to “boost trade ties” with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a six-country trade bloc comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Trade between the UK and the GCC hit a record high of £61.3bn in 2022. In her speech to the Conservative party conference in October 2022, the then prime minister, Liz Truss, said the UK had “become too complacent” and “too dependent on authoritarian regimes for cheap goods and energy”. However, it appears that the UK has diverted its spending from Russia to other states accused of human rights violations and engaged in brutal conflicts. Fossil fuel imports from Russia fell from £600m in February 2022, the month Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, to zero in January 2023. However, this was compensated for by a more than 60% annual increase in fossil fuel imports from other authoritarian petrostates. Last year the amount spent by the UK on energy imports topped £100bn for the first time on record, with DeSmog’s analysis indicating that the UK spent more than £125.7bn on fossil fuel imports in the year beginning February 2022. The International Energy Agency has stated that, in order to achieve net zero, the world must achieve “huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas”, requiring “nothing short of the complete transformation of the global energy system”. The UK imported £6.9bn of fossil fuels from Qatar, £3.4bn from Saudi Arabia, £2.6bn from Kuwait, and £2.5bn from the UAE. “While cutting our dependence on Russian fossil fuels is both necessary and laudable – albeit with little actual choice – it is a half-measure if only aimed at reducing fossil fuels from Russia,” said Dominic Kavakeb, of the human rights and environmental pressure group Global Witness. “Replacing Russian energy with fossil fuels from other authoritarian regimes, some of which are also engaged in brutal conflicts, is at best shortsighted, at worst a gross hypocrisy. Fossil fuels are the currency of dictators and warmongers everywhere. It’s time to build an energy system that benefits people and the planet, rather than polluters, petrostates and despots.” This year’s Cop28 UN climate summit will be held in the UAE, a nation that has attracted criticism over its plans to expand fossil fuel operations and its appointment of Sultan Al Jaber, head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, as summit president. Al Jaber recently said that fossil fuels should “continue to play a role in the foreseeable future” – a statement labelled as “very dangerous” by former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres. The average monthly value of fossil fuel imports from the UAE to the UK increased from £84.4m in the year to February 2022 to £195m the year after. The UAE continues to arrest and imprison activists, academics and lawyers who speak out against its monarchic rulers. UAE authorities also continue to discriminate against women, LGBTQ+ communities, and migrants. Despite record high prices for oil and gas – a response to Russia’s invasion and loosened Covid restrictions – the volume of fossil fuels imported to the UK during 2022 remained stable, according to data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (Desnz). Saudi Arabia was an increasingly significant energy source for the UK, with monthly fossil fuel imports from the Kingdom quadrupling from £50.4m to £263.8m in the year ending February 2023. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has noted the prevalence of arbitrary detention in Saudi Arabia – calling it “a hallmark of authoritarian regimes” – as well as reports of torture, neglect, lack of medical care and solitary confinement. Saudi Arabia also routinely executes political dissidents, having killed an average of 129 people a year since crown prince Mohammed bin Salman assumed de facto rule in 2015. Neighbouring Qatar has also profited from higher fossil fuel exports to the UK, jumping to £531.5m a month on average in the year following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine from an average of £201.1m the year before. Last year’s football World Cup highlighted Qatar’s poor record on human rights, particularly in relation to migrant workers. A Guardian analysis in February 2021 found that over 6,500 migrants from South Asian countries had died in Qatar since it was awarded the World Cup in 2011. Despite the UK government having incrementally banned the importation of Russian fossil fuels following Putin’s invasion, Russian fossil fuels are still entering the UK indirectly via imports from India, which is a major importer alongside China. Global demand for Russian oil has now surged to its highest level since the invasion. Dr David Wearing, a lecturer in international relations at Sussex University, said the UK’s increased reliance on Gulf states for fossil fuels and investment was based “not on an economic calculation but a strategic political calculation”. Gulf states sent “a big chunk of their petrodollars into our financial system”, Wearing said. “Those capital flows help to square off the fact that Britain’s got a huge deficit on its current account [imports v exports], which becomes more important with Brexit … That’s the crux of the relationship.” Gulf fossil fuels were “strategically important in terms of power politics too”, Wearing said, in terms of keeping these countries aligned with the west rather than China. “For all these different reasons, it’s [seen as] important to keep the Gulf states as they are and keep those ruling families in power – so that the UK can trust them to continue staying aligned with the western bloc and sending their petrodollars into our economic system.” The UK’s continued reliance on fossil fuels is also costly for the British population. The average UK home will spend nearly £6,000 on foreign gas in the next 12 years, including £140 on Qatari gas every year, according to a report from the Energy and Climate Change Intelligence Unit (ECIU). This cost would be reduced to £1,400 spent on foreign gas by 2030 in a typical net zero home, the ECIU said. An earlier report from the ECIU also found that, without mitigation, the UK’s dependence on imported gas was set to increase by 75% by 2035. A government spokesperson said: “We continue to work with international partners to maintain stability in global energy markets and boost our energy security. While we are accelerating renewables and nuclear as part of our plans to power up Britain, the transition to cleaner energy cannot happen overnight and we will continue to need oil and gas over the coming decades, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a96c', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/09/australian-governments-impose-mandatory-packaging-rules-on-industry-to-cut-waste', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Australian governments impose recycling rules after packaging industry fails on waste', 'lead': 'New rules agreed at meeting of environment ministers welcomed as breakthrough by conservationists', 'author': 'Adam Morton Climate and environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-09 07:57:17', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562188', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/f6e2d61030698b0b0a34edb42aef5876c93eb8ac/0_272_4308_2585/500.jpg', 'body': 'Industry will be forced to do more to cut waste and boost recycling after Australia’s federal and state governments agreed for the first time to impose mandatory packaging rules on manufacturers and retailers. The agreement, at a meeting of environment ministers in Sydney on Friday, was welcomed by conservationists as a major breakthrough after years of voluntary industry action has failed to reduce waste. The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the “historic agreement” meant packaging would be “subject to strict new government rules”. A communique released after the meeting said a new regulatory scheme would shift the country towards a circular economy that would minimise waste and lead to materials being “recovered, reused, recycled and reprocessed”. It promised compulsory rules for packaging design based on international best practice and that harmful chemicals and contaminants would be regulated out. A roadmap would be developed to “harmonise” kerbside waste collection across the country and a framework for recycled content traceability would be introduced to give business confidence to use recycled materials, it said. Plibersek said while some in the industry had voluntarily reduced their impact, it had been “just not enough”. An official review in April found Australia was recycling just 18% of plastic packaging, and would fall well short of a target of 70% by 2025. The minister said the call for regulation had been supported by some major companies including Nestlé, Unilever and Coca-Cola. “We need to dramatically reduce packaging waste, and the harmful chemicals that destroy our environment. We see packaging in the guts of dead birds, floating in our oceans, destroying nature as it takes generations to degrade,” she said. “Put simply, we’re making too much, using too much, and too much is ending up in landfill.” The Boomerang Alliance, a coalition of 55 environment groups, said the agreement was the first “substantial and meaningful step” to deal with waste in 20 years. “This is absolutely the right decision, and a key first step to tackle the growing waste and plastic pollution harming the oceans and climate,” the alliance’s director, Jeff Angel, said. “Mandatory standards for recycled content and targets are essential to create the economic rationale for new recycling and reprocessing plants. New rules to minimise wasteful packaging will also help tackle the plastic waste and pollution tidal wave projected by the UN.” Angel said the agreement needed to be followed by “a comprehensive product stewardship scheme” that forced industry to pay for collection and recycling programs. He said it must avoid the mistakes of the failed REDcycle scheme, which led to 12,000 tonnes of soft plastics collected at supermarkets being stockpiled in warehouses across three states while consumers were told it was being recycled. Much of Australia’s recyclable rubbish was sent overseas until August 2019, when then prime minister Scott Morrison announced a ban on the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres. Coalition and Labor governments subsequently announced hundreds of millions in funding for recycling facilities, but until now resisted rules that ensured they would be viable. The announcement comes amid a global push to cut plastic use. Plibersek attended negotiations in Paris on a proposed global plastic treaty earlier this month. The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association, representing companies that deal with rubbish and recycling, welcomed an agreement, saying it meant there would “finally be real action” on packaging. The association’s chief executive, Gayle Sloan, said it was “a great start” and “the first step on the path to creating the level playing field industry desperately needs between virgin and recycled materials”. The environment group World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia said the agreement would “have a major impact on Australia’s plastic pollution crisis”.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a96e', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/09/country-diary-far-from-roar-of-the-tt-i-find-wildlife-bliss', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: Far from roar of the TT, I find wildlife bliss | David Bellamy', 'lead': '<strong>Lezayre, Isle of Man:</strong> The island is bursting into life – not least here, on this farm, which is reaping the rewards of traditional haymaking', 'author': 'David Bellamy', 'datePublished': '2023-06-09 04:30:50', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562226', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/ae9eb20c2328398ba6941fe799fcd044aeb22c36/0_209_4032_2418/500.jpg', 'body': 'It is hard to escape the noise of the TT festival. On a small, quiet island the sudden arrival of tens of thousands of visitors on their motorbikes is a shock to the system. Many residents look forward to June when the island bursts into life. The pubs probably make more in a fortnight than the rest of the year. But many islanders loathe the chaos and inconvenience. This is the only time you’ll find yourself in a Manx traffic jam. Having no interest in the bikes myself, the TT means something altogether different, for it coincides with one of the greatest wildlife phenomena to be found in the British Isles: the flowering of our traditional hay meadows. Haymaking is among the most ancient forms of agriculture. Dry grass cut in late summer will preserve itself and get a flock or herd through the winter. Crucially, this late cut, compared with spring-cut silage, which is preserved in plastic wrap, also allows birds to raise their chicks and plants to flower and set seed – resulting in wildlife bliss. Undertaking some TT escapism, my refuge is a most wondrous meadow. Among a sea of thousands of flowers are five species of orchid, including the rare greater butterfly orchid, which can only truly be appreciated by lying down on your belly. It is among the most striking of all the 500 or so plant species that call our island home. Any meadow hosting them should be worshipped. Upliftingly, I’m not on a nature reserve. This is an ordinary farm with an extraordinary farmer. Long ago, we didn’t need nature reserves when so much farmland looked like this. My refuge is interrupted by the monotonous throb of a helicopter, signifying that the race leader is approaching. The course is a mile away, yet the clamour of roaring bikes is undiminished. Peace does not return until they have beasted their way up over the mountain. The din subsides, yet the meadow is still alive with a frenzy of butterflies, hoverflies, bees.

But this time the scenes were in New York City, as smoke from more than 400 wildfires darkened the famous skyline and gave the US its worst day of air pollution in recent history. The scenes from the eastern seaboard harkened back to mid-September 2020 when out of control wildfires covered much of the American west in smoke, casting San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge and skyscrapers under an otherworldly orange glow. Before this week, 13 and 14 September 2020 were the worst days since 2006 for pollution from wildfire smoke. Then came Canada’s wildfires which brought a once unimaginable and faraway problem to a region unfamiliar with such a disaster and a public unaccustomed to the risks of wildfire smoke and the necessary precautions. “I don’t know if people understand how bad it can be,” said Keith Bein, a professional researcher at the University of California, Davis. “Maybe the really healthy individual is not going to have a problem. [For] the susceptible populations, there’s a real chance this could trigger something. This could be a tipping point.” While unprecedented on the east coast, residents of the American west have grown used to the effects of wildfires thanks to years of large-scale, devastating blazes that have upended life across the region – and they have some advice. “Mask up, use an air purifier and stay indoors if you can. If you feel tired, cranky, or out of sorts, you are probably feeling the smoke,” said the writer SE Smith on Twitter. “Some tips for friends on the east coast: 1) Don’t go outside 2) Wear a mask if you must go outside 3) Run an air purifier all day and all night 4) AC should be in recirculate mode. Sincerely, a coast who deals with this crisis often,” Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for the California governor, said on Twitter. Smoke is now basically a California summer, the wildlife advocate Beth Pratt said on Twitter. “A good air filter helps, but also just be careful with being outdoors (and monitor pets).” Bein, who travels to wildfire zones to collect data on smoke to measure how it impacts humans, echoed that recommendation. “Reduce as much as you can physical activity. You want to be idle, you want to stay indoors, close your windows, you want to turn on your HVAC systems. If you have a personal air purifier turn them on.” The best thing to do is to leave the affected area, Bein said, acknowledging that in some events there is nowhere to go and not everyone has the resources to leave. He recommends that those who don’t have access to resources in their home go to a public place that does, such as a library. People should also be wearing masks, particularly if they have a pre-existing condition or are part of a vulnerable group, such as elderly people and pregnant women. Wildfire smoke at the level seen on the east coast permeates everything and the risk for air pollution remains even when you cannot see or smell it. “Even after that subsides it’s still in the air, it’s still coming off your clothes and walls. The same is going to apply if it infiltrates your home and coats your walls, it doesn’t disappear when the plume disappears.” Research into the impacts of wildfire smoke, both long-term and immediate, is a relatively recent development and there is much that is still unknown, Bein said. But studies have tied smoke exposure to increased heart attack risks, greater risk of premature births and decreased test scores in kids. “There’s nothing good about breathing wildfire smoke,” said Bein. “Are you able to protect yourself? Do you have air purifiers? Do you have N95s? Do you know how to use them? Do you know you need to use them?” And given the increasing number of wildfires in the forests of Canada, residents of the east coast should prepare for more smoky days. “This could become a major problem for the eastern seaboard in the coming years as climate change accelerates and these fires become larger and more common,” Bein said. “You get this apocalyptic doomsday sense of orange skies forever every day and this becomes the new norm.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a970', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/air-quality-record-smoke-hazard-wildfire-worst-day-ever-canada-new-york', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Air pollution in US from wildfire smoke is worst in recent recorded history', 'lead': 'Exclusive: rapid analysis of extreme event by Stanford University shows worst day of exposure to such pollution since 2006', 'author': 'Oliver Milman in New York', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 17:29:05', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562263', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/19bc1de2a9f119b158991dc95d2d878356dc3bc0/0_524_7988_4796/500.jpg', 'body': 'The US experienced its worst toxic air pollution from wildfire smoke in its recent recorded history on Wednesday, researchers have found, with people in New York exposed to levels of pollution more than five times above the national air quality standard. The rapid analysis of the extreme event, shared with the Guardian, found that smoke billowing south from forest fires in Canada caused Americans to suffer the worst day of average exposure to such pollution since a dataset on smoky conditions started in 2006. “It’s the worst by far, I mean, Jesus, it was bad,” said Marshall Burke, an environmental scientist at Stanford University who led the work. “It’s hard to believe to be honest, we had to quadruple check it to see if it was right. We have not seen events like this, or even close to this, on the east coast before. This is a historic event.” The Stanford researchers calculated that the average American on Wednesday was exposed to 27.5 micrograms per cubic meter of small particulate matter carried within the plumes of smoke. These tiny flecks of soot, dust and other burned debris, known as PM2.5, bury deep in the lungs when inhaled and are linked to a variety of health conditions and can cause deaths. This high average level of pollution is well beyond the next largest such event, experienced in September 2020 on the US west coast following a record year of fires in the western states, and was far more severe for those directly in the path of the smoke, across much of the north-east US. In New York, where the sky went from a milky white to a Blade Runner orange over the course of a day when schools and playgrounds shut down outdoor activities and people started donning masks outside not worn since the early days of the pandemic, the particulate matter hit around 195 micrograms, more than five times above the national air quality standard. “The levels yesterday were quite dangerous, particularly if you are in a vulnerable group,” said Burke, adding that this includes vast swaths of people such as the elderly, children, pregnant women and those with prior medical conditions. “I expect we will see an uptick in respiratory hospitalizations, pre-term births and, sadly, mortalities.” Many New Yorkers stayed indoors rather than brave the campfire smell lingering on streets shrouded in smoke but even this did not fully shield most people, Burke said, with indoor air monitors in Manhattan showing that people experienced more than 100 micrograms of particulate matter. “People had terrible indoor air too, just really bad,” he said. “Even staying at home is not fully protective. Good luck to anyone trying to get an air filter anywhere in New York yesterday. The eastern seaboard luckily hasn’t had to deal with air quality events like this before, so many people just weren’t prepared.” The Stanford research looks at wildfire smoke levels and gauges the average exposure for all Americans, and has done so since 2006. Burke said, however, that growth in both population and the severity of wildfires, driven by the climate crisis, means that it is unlikely that more people have ever previously been exposed to toxic wildfire smoke than on Wednesday. While previous blazes in California have caused similarly high levels of air pollution, the east coast’s cluster of large cities means that more people have been exposed to harmful air than in previous events. New York City health officials have rolled out a list of safety measures to take as the city remains shrouded in a thick, smoky haze, which could last for several more days as smoke continues to pour from unusually widespread fires in Quebec. In addition to urging residents to wear high-quality masks such as N95s or KN95s, health officials are urging residents to keep windows closed, use an air purifier if possible, and if an air conditioner is on, to close the fresh air intake to prevent outdoor air from entering inside homes. Francesca Dominici, an expert in air pollution and climate at Harvard University, said that people should also refrain from exercising outdoors to avoid the “crazy levels” of air pollution, but that she still expected a surge of hospitalizations from cardiovascular and respiratory problems triggered by the smoke. “You can do some things to protect yourself but this just shows that climate change isn’t just affecting glaciers and polar bears, it’s affecting us to the point we can’t breathe clean air any more,” she said. “I hope as part of this crisis there is an opportunity to realize we need to act on climate change. We’ve gone from three years of not going out because of Covid and now we can’t go outside because of polluted air. The world and nature is telling us something, it’s sending us a very strong message.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a971', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/activists-take-canadas-environment-minister-to-court-in-fight-to-save-northern-spotted-owl-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Activists take Canada’s environment minister to court in fight to save northern spotted owl', 'lead': 'Advocacy group says continued destruction of critical habitat leaves it no choice but to take legal action against Steven Guilbeault', 'author': 'Leyland Cecco in Toronto', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 15:15:44', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562281', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/a31741cd687fc2d387f10c4dbadbff18fe3b788c/0_163_5100_3060/500.jpg', 'body': 'Environmental groups in Canada are taking legal action against the country’s environment minister, arguing his delay in protecting old growth forest is harming the critically endangered northern spotted owl. In February, Steven Guilbeault said he would recommend an emergency order after determining the species was facing “imminent threats” to its survival. Emergency orders are a powerful tool under Canada’s endangered species legislation and have been used only three times in the country’s history, including once by Guilbeault. They grant the federal government jurisdiction over decisions typically reserved for a province, including the ability to dictate which forests are off limits to logging. Decades of old growth clearcutting have wiped out much of the northern spotted owl’s habitat in British Columbia, leaving the wild population in Canada at just one female, down from about 40 breeding pairs in the 90s. The minister initially determined that old-growth logging must stop within an area of the Spô’zêm Nation territory, including the Spuzzum and Utzlius watersheds, as well as a further 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) of forest habitat at risk. But in the four months since Guilbeault announced plans for an emergency order, environmental groups say he has failed to follow through. “The minister is legally obligated to make an emergency order recommendation to cabinet to protect this iconic species – any further delay is unacceptable,” said Rachel Gutman, a lawyer with Ecojustice, which is representing the advocacy group Wilderness Committee. “With the logging season upon us and only one owl remaining in the wild, the failure to immediately protect the species’ remaining habitat risks the extirpation of the spotted owl from Canada.” Joe Foy, a spokesperson for Wilderness Committee, said: “We’ve been insanely patient as we wait for the federal government to put their spotted owl recovery strategy in place and for the minister to recommend an emergency order, even though we’ve watched spotted owl numbers dwindle down extremely low. But the situation we’re in now is alarming.” In late May, Foy and Geoff Senichenko, a mapper with Wilderness Committee, travelled to areas in British Columbia that the federal government had previously indicated would become “critical habitat” as part of its spotted owl recovery plan, a powerful designation which would halt logging under federal law. Foy alleges logging companies have raced to harvest those areas before they are formally designated off limits. “We saw areas that had been mapped as critical habitat already logged, we saw areas where there’s critical habitat being logged right now. And we saw areas of standing forest marked as critical habitat in the federal government’s draft spotted owl recovery plan that are pending approval for logging,” he said. “We’re in a very dire situation. The forest is broken and the federal government has a plan to fix it. But if those forests are logged, it would make the recovery of spotted owls highly unlikely.” In an interview with the Guardian in April, Guilbeault said he was wary of recommending the emergency order to cabinet because of concerns it could “seriously degrade” the relationship between the province of British Columbia and the federal government, stalling efforts to save a number of other species, including caribou. “The reality is, it’s a last-resort measure. Because once you do that, there is no more collaboration,” he said. However, he added that fear of damaging the relationship between federal government and the province “can’t be used as an excuse for not acting”. Last month, two spotted owls from a breeding programme released into the wild were found dead, highlighting the steep challenges in recovering the species. Environmental groups say more protection is needed, arguing the fate of the small predators is a glimpse into the health of the region’s ancient rainforests. “It’s up to citizens to try to do the right thing,” Foy said of the lawsuit. “Clearly, we’ve tried everything else.

Speaking at Cheltenham science festival, he said Britain was not ready for such rewilding schemes, despite the potential ecological benefits. “I don’t think we should be discussing reintroducing lynx or wolf at this stage because we still have two apex predators that we can’t live with – the hen harrier and the golden eagle,” he said. “These are still being poisoned.” Until there is better management of existing predators and viable compensation schemes and incentives for farmers and gamekeepers, he added, “I don’t think we have the right to play God.” Speaking after the talk, he gave the example of Idaho, where the reintroduction of wolves has led to “monumental” hatred of the animals among many people there. In Sweden, he said, bringing back wolves almost led to a change of government after people’s dogs were eaten. “These animals only have to consume somebody’s dog and they then become the hound of hell – and what happens is you end up with more hatred for the animal than before you started, which is counterproductive in the long term,” he said. In recent years, support has grown for the idea of reintroducing species that once lived in the UK, and Mears said there were positive examples, including the successful reintroduction of beavers in Argyll. Some people are now calling for the reintroduction of wolves and lynx, which could help restore forests by keeping roe deer and rabbit populations in check. Scotland and Northumberland have been proposed as suitable locations for wild lynx, which were last seen in Britain more than 1,000 years ago. However, Mears said that such efforts would be challenging. “We don’t have vast tracts of wilderness, but we have a broken landscape made up of urban conurbation and farmland,” he said. Even in the most remote areas, there is the question of whether predators will settle at the site after they are reintroduced. “The problem is you can’t contain them,” Mears said. “They are wild animals. They’re very intelligent, incredibly intelligent.” He added that while deer often learned to avoid predators, the same was not true of livestock. “The deer will very quickly learn and become very intelligent … but the sheep don’t, so the wolf will obviously go for the sheep.” Dr Rob Stoneman of the Wildlife Trusts said: “The UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and people are fed up with hearing about catastrophic declines. A recent poll showed 76% of people are worried about the state of nature and we all want to see change – for the sake of our wildlife, wellbeing and climate. “Reintroducing apex predators such as lynx would play a vital role in helping to restore nature because they have hugely positive effects on woodlands – in the UK many woods are known to be in poor condition. “They’re badly needed to help maintain balanced numbers of other animals so that woods can regenerate. Lynx are shy creatures that keep their distance from humans, and they’ve been welcomed back across Europe as a beautiful icon of nature recovery. It’s time we did the same.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a973', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/army-of-fake-social-media-accounts-defend-uae-presidency-of-climate-summit', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Army of fake social media accounts defend UAE presidency of climate summit', 'lead': 'Sultan Al Jaber – Cop28 president and CEO of state oil firm – is ‘ally the climate movement needs’, posts say', 'author': 'Damian Carrington Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 13:44:04', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562318', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/cacfeaa49c3c7161f324e1c5b3ed7f0bc258450d/0_0_2955_1773/500.jpg', 'body': 'An army of fake social media accounts on Twitter and the blogging site Medium have been promoting and defending the controversial hosting of a UN climate summit by the United Arab Emirates. The president of the Cop28 climate talks is Sultan Al Jaber, who is also the chief executive of the state oil giant Adnoc, which has major net zero-busting expansion plans. Posts from fake accounts claimed: “The UAE’s commitment to being the perfect host for Cop28 is a testament to its leadership in tackling climate change,” and that Al Jaber is “the ally the climate movement needs”. Others retweeted or reposted UAE government tweets or sought to rebut criticism. One account had an AI-generated profile picture, but text labelling the image as fake had not been cropped out. The fake accounts were revealed in a Twitter thread by Dr Marc Owen Jones, of Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, who is an expert on social media disinformation and the Middle East. He described it as “a large, multilingual astro-turfing effort” involving at least 100 fake accounts and 30,000 tweets. Jones said analysis of the tweets from a large sample of the fake account network showed the most popular topic for promotion recently was Cop28. Following Jones’s exposure of the network, some accounts were suspended by Twitter but dozens switched their content to new user names. Jones said: “It is a network of fake accounts trying to promote UAE foreign policy. They’re focusing on promoting, or greenwashing, Cop28 by defending and deflecting criticism of having Cop28 in the UAE. “These accounts are pretending to be people that they’re not in order to give the illusion of popular grassroots support for a position – it’s called astro-turfing,” he said. “It’s an act of deception, and examples of newspapers quoting them means that they’ve definitely fooled people into thinking that they’re real people.” A Cop28 spokesperson said: “These [fake accounts] are generated by outside actors unconnected to Cop28 and are clearly designed to discredit Cop28 and the climate process.” The spokesperson said the Cop28 office had flagged the issue with Twitter, asking for immediate action, and directly reported fake accounts using Twitter’s reporting form. It is not known who is running the network. Jones said: “Attribution is very difficult. But based on past experience, it’s almost certainly some strategic communications company working on behalf of the UAE. That’s Occam’s razor: the most likely explanation.” Data from Twitter on the number of accounts suspended between 2018 and 2021 for having links to state-backed information operations ranks the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt as the worst offenders in the world after China. Al Jaber’s presidency of Cop28 has attracted significant criticism, with the French MEP Manon Aubry recently describing it as “like having a tobacco multinational overseeing the internal work of the World Health Organization”. The former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres called his approach “dangerous” in May. The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that, despite denials, the oil company had been able to see emails to and from the Cop28 office and was consulted on how to respond to an inquiry from the Guardian. Al Jaber’s team has also been accused of Wikipedia “greenwashing”. In addition to being the head of Adnoc, Al Jaber chairs Masdar, a renewable energy company. He has previously defended his appointment, and told the Guardian in April that his business ties would prove an asset in ensuring the private sector took the necessary action on the climate crisis. Jones identified the fake accounts using evidence such as batch creation on the same dates, stock or AI-generated profile pictures, generic formatting, language and posting times, and the absence of any other internet presence. A first tranche of fake accounts was created in August 2021 and a second, larger tranche in February 2022. The accounts support other UAE policy objectives, including Sudan, technology, food and culture. But Jones said the most popular topic recently was Cop28. One account, @MahmudViyan, was supposedly a human rights supporter in the UAE. It had a profile picture in which the text “this-person-does-not-exist.com” had failed to be cropped out, identifying the image as coming from a website generating AI photos. Another account, @FadelYael, supposedly a space scientist living in the UAE, had a profile picture also used by a cosmetic dentistry website. After Jones’s Twitter thread about the account, the user name was deleted and the account and all tweets were moved to a new Twitter handle, @MissAhmadlyn. Four accounts were supposedly those of female environmental workers from the US who were living in the UAE. Jones described their profile pictures as “impossibly sultry”. After Jones exposed the fake accounts, dozens switched to new user names and the tweets he highlighted were also deleted. “Whoever created this network is very aware that I tweeted this thread because they’ve now engaged in evasive action,” he said. A number of the fake profiles also posted blogs on Medium, including “Samantha Ali”, who wrote a post in February titled “Sultan Al Jaber: The Ally the Climate Movement Needs for COP28 UAE”, which said “skeptics should stop griping: Al Jaber is precisely the kind of ally the climate movement needs”. Other fake accounts commented on this fake post. The profile picture of “Samantha Ali” is a stock photo and the same Medium account previously used the name “Joie Cooper”. On the same day in February, and using the same image, “Asher Siegel” wrote a post titled “Why Climate Activists Should Give Sultan Al Jaber a Chance”. His profile picture is a stock image described as “handsome Syrian man at the train station”.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a974', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/climate-crisis-leading-to-more-turbulence-during-flights-says-study', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Climate crisis leading to more turbulence during flights, says study', 'lead': 'Researchers say bumpier air travel is driving up costs and increasing the risks for passengers and crew', 'author': 'Matthew Taylor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 13:00:32', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562337', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c2f1af09dedcee94d0ca8cbee95c87b4a4d987/0_0_5499_3299/500.jpg', 'body': 'The climate crisis is leading to more turbulence during flights, driving up costs and increasing the risks for passengers and crew, according to new research. The study found that warmer air, caused by carbon emissions, is creating bumpier flights around the world with severe turbulence in the North Atlantic up by 55% since 1979. The study’s co-author Mark Prosser, from the University of Reading, said every additional minute spent travelling through turbulence increased the wear and tear on an aircraft, as well as the risk of injuries to passengers and flight attendants. “Turbulence makes flights bumpy and can occasionally be dangerous. Airlines will need to start thinking about how they will manage the increased turbulence, as it costs the industry $150-500m annually in the USA alone.” Previous studies have suggested that a climate that is heating up could increase turbulence but Prof Paul Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading and co-author of the research, said it was the first evidence it was already happening. “We should be investing in improved turbulence forecasting and detection systems, to prevent the rougher air from translating into bumpier flights in the coming decades,” he said. The rapidly changing climate is already known to be affecting air travel. A faster jet stream across the Atlantic is increasing travel times and rising temperatures are reducing the weight aircraft can carry. At the same time carbon emissions from aviation are a significant driver of the climate crisis. The study, published in the Geophysical Research Letters journal, found that at a typical point over the north Atlantic – one of the world’s busiest flight routes – the total annual duration of severe turbulence increased by 55% from 17.7 hours in 1979 to 27.4 hours in 2020. Moderate turbulence increased by 37% from 70.0 to 96.1 hours, and light turbulence increased by 17% from 466.5 to 546.8 hours. The authors said that while the US and north Atlantic had experienced the largest increases, other busy flight routes over Europe, the Middle East and the south Atlantic also recorded significant increases in turbulence. Williams said: “Following a decade of research showing that climate change will increase clear-air turbulence in the future, we now have evidence suggesting that the increase has already begun.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a975', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/forever-chemicals-pfas-low-birth-weight-obesity-research', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Forever chemicals’ exposure can lead to low birth weight and obesity in later life', 'lead': 'Children whose mothers are exposed to toxic PFAS can experience phenomenon previously linked to fetal tobacco smoke exposure', 'author': 'Tom Perkins', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 11:00:05', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562354', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/9d6ad3e2cea9bdbc718c73442e395881cb22dc6a/0_143_5292_3177/500.jpg', 'body': 'Children whose mothers are exposed to toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” during pregnancy run an increased risk of low birth weight as well as obesity and high body mass index later in life, an effect similar to prenatal exposure to tobacco, new research finds. The low birth rate effects of some PFAS have been previously established, but the study tracked 1,400 kids and found higher BMIs and more incidences of obesity in those ages two to five. The “low birth weight-high obesity risk paradox” was previously associated with tobacco smoke exposure during fetal development. “Something similar is going on with PFAS,” said Joe Braun, a Brown University researcher and study co-author. PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. The compounds are ubiquitous, and linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally degrade in the environment. A recent review of published research found PFAS in umbilical cord blood in all approximately 30,000 samples collectively checked in the studies. Though previous research found evidence suggesting the chemicals are linked to obesity early and later in life, including some research from the new study’s authors, the findings were generally inconclusive. The authors say the new research is more definitive because it included a larger sample size, greater geographic coverage, longer timespan and a wider range of exposure levels. As with tobacco smoke exposure, babies who are born underweight due to PFAS exposure can experience a rapid catch-up in weight, but not height, and the weight gain happens earlier than for children who will be a normal weight, Braun said. The precise reason PFAS cause these issues is not known for certain, said Jamie Liu, a Brown researcher and study co-author, but she added she suspected the chemicals affect DNA methylation. The methylation process is related to how the body produces cells, which all have the same DNA. Methylation is part of the mechanism that creates different cells – it determines which cell is an eye cell and which is a kidney cell, for example. During prenatal development, DNA methylation is one of the “switches that tells the body ‘this is how life is going to be on the outside’”, Braun said. The authors last year examined markers of DNA methylation in white blood cells and found PFAS exposure seemed to change how the body metabolizes energy from birth up to 12 years of age, which could affect growth. “PFAS seem to have a programming effect … that lasted for up to 12 years,” Braun said. Overall, the research found about a 12% increase in the likelihood of obesity among PFAS-exposed fetuses. Those who are exposed can mitigate the effects later in life through regular exercise, Braun said, but it is difficult for mothers to protect themselves and their fetuses because PFAS are so widely used. The US government estimates the chemicals are in 98% of Americans’ blood, and they often have long half-lives, so PFAS from an exposure years before a pregnancy could still harm a fetus. But, broadly speaking, people can take some steps to reduce PFAS exposure, Braun said. That includes filtering water – the chemicals are thought to be contaminating drinking water for more than 200 million Americans. Indoor dust is another major exposure route, and using a vacuum cleaner that has a Hepa filter can remove contaminants from the indoor environment, Braun said. Food represents perhaps the most significant exposure route, in part because the chemicals are frequently used in food packaging. Eating fresh foods that are not in packaging and pursuing a balanced diet could be beneficial, Braun added. “Those are probably the three best things you can do to hedge your bets,” he said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a976', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/biden-white-house-mountain-valley-pipeline-protesters', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Protesters to march on White House as anger mounts over Appalachia pipeline', 'lead': 'Activists to gather in Washington to demand Joe Biden ‘reclaim his climate legacy’ by blocking 300-mile Mountain Valley pipeline', 'author': 'Oliver Milman in New York', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 11:00:04', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562372', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/7757e10c29de9802d705eba0be7d7ae7883bea5a/0_70_3000_1800/500.jpg', 'body': 'Protesters are set to descend upon the White House on Thursday under smoky skies amid growing anger among climate activists at Joe Biden for allowing a controversial gas pipeline in Appalachia to be fast-tracked. Several hundred protesters are expected to gather in Washington to demand Biden “reclaim his climate legacy” by blocking the Mountain Valley pipeline, a 300-mile pipeline that will bring fracked gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia. Organizers said they had ordered N95 masks to help protect protesters amid the air quality alerts linked to the Canadian wildfires. “They’ll be risking arrest under skies filled with smoke from wildfires fueled by the growing climate crisis,” said organizer Jamie Henn of Fossil Free Media. The Mountain Valley pipeline project has been enmeshed in legal challenges for years due to opposition from grassroots groups and landowners but the deal passed by Congress to raise the US’s debt ceiling, signed by Biden over the weekend, singles out the pipeline as being “required in the national interest” and therefore should be allowed to proceed, shielded from any future judicial review. The expediting of the pipeline provoked outrage from activists as well as some Democratic allies of Biden, with Tim Kaine, the senator from Virginia, complaining that he “strongly opposes” the decision to “green-light this pipeline without normal administrative and judicial review and ignore the voices of Virginians”. Protesters have already voiced their displeasure directly to Senator Joe Manchin, the conservative West Virginia Democrat and key swing Senate vote who was instrumental in the pipeline’s inclusion in the debt deal. About two dozen protesters interrupted a speech by Manchin at an event on Tuesday by storming the stage and chanting, “Dirty deal, MVP, Manchin, you are killing me!” Manchin, who has received more money from the gas pipeline industry than any other senator, has said that the project is vital to lower energy costs for Americans. “America is blessed with an ocean of energy under our feet, and our oil and natural gas can be produced cleaner than virtually anywhere else in the world,” the senator said. The Biden administration, meanwhile, has insisted that the pipeline would probably have gone ahead anyway, regardless of the debt deal. However, organizers of the White House protest say they are dismayed at Biden’s acquiescence to the pipeline, which follows previous decisions by the administration to allow the Willow oil drilling project in Alaska and a buildout of gas export facilities on the Gulf of Mexico coast. The International Energy Agency has made clear that there can be no new fossil fuel infrastructure built if the world is to avoid disastrous global heating. “I’m just so disappointed. It feels like President Biden is selling out. He has pushed so many fossil fuel projects in the last six months that I just can’t believe it,” said Crystal Cavalier, co-founder of 7 Directions of Service, an Indigenous environmental justice group that has been campaigning against the pipeline for the past five years. “They say this pipeline is for national security but it’s just protecting the money and investments of the developers. I hope President Biden hears us, stops these archaic policies and starts listening to people. “He said there would be no more fossil fuel permitting and he just keeps breaking his promises. They are making us into a sacrifice zone and they really have to stop.” Cavalier listed a litany of objections to the pipeline, such as its potential contamination of the hundreds of rivers, streams and wetlands it crosses, including well drinking water, along with the disturbance of Native American burial sites and increased air pollution suffered by low-income communities along the route of the project. Fears of an environmental disaster emanating from the pipeline have been heightened by the project’s patchy record, with hundreds of clean water violations recorded across West Virginia and Virginia since it was first conceived nearly a decade ago. Last year, a gas storage well overseen by Equitrans Midstream Corporation, operators of the Mountain Valley pipeline, leaked more than 1bn cubic ft of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere for 13 days before being plugged. Many of the planned sections of the new pipeline, meanwhile, may have corroded during the long wait for its completion. The project will lead to between 6m and 89m tons of extra planet-heating emissions should it go ahead, depending on conflicting estimates as to its impact. The pipeline’s operator has insisted it has followed best environmental practices and on Monday requested that a federal appeals court toss out a legal challenge to the project, arguing that the debt ceiling bill had rendered the case moot. Thomas Karam, chief executive of Equitrans, said that the project “has gone through more environmental review and scrutiny than any natural gas pipeline project in US history” and should be allowed to go ahead. Mountain Valley only has 20 miles of pipeline left to lay before the project is completed, and it appears that Manchin’s long ambition to see it finished may be in sight. Opponents, though, insist the administration can still find a way to stymie it. “Even if some of these permits are issued and initially shielded from judicial review, that’s not necessarily the end of the line,” said Jason Rylander, senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, who said that the pipeline still has to cross some difficult terrain, including areas of national forest, that will require permits. Barry Rabe, an expert in environmental policy at the University of Michigan, said that with no plan set forward by Congress to shift away from gas or build new networks of power lines to transport clean electricity, fights similar to the Mountain Valley pipeline are likely to continue. “We are in a transition, but we are still producing and shipping and exporting gas,” he said. “With the Inflation Reduction Act we’ve taken a huge step in terms of incentives but it will only go so far. We have no carbon price, no ban on oil or gas production, nothing like they have in the European Union. The US is really playing catch-up.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a977', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/england-raw-sewage-taskforce-met-once-in-last-year-storm-overflows', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'England raw sewage taskforce has only met once in last year, FoI request reveals', 'lead': 'Storm overflows group has been promoted by ministers as evidence they are taking issue seriously', 'author': 'Sandra Laville', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 08:48:44', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562389', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d43fa247d788a94771eaf7cd5f7b8750ca8b7bbc/0_0_6048_3629/500.jpg', 'body': 'The storm overflows taskforce set up by the government to tackle raw sewage discharges by water companies in England has only met once in the last year, a freedom of information request has revealed. The group, which was promoted by ministers as evidence that they were taking the issue of raw sewage discharges by water companies seriously, is supposed to meet fortnightly, according to its mission statement. But in response to a freedom of information request by the Good Law Project, officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the taskforce had only met once in the last year. The storm overflows taskforce was set up in August 2020 after the Guardian first uncovered the scale of raw sewage discharges into rivers by water companies. It is made up of representatives from government, regulators, the water industry and environmental NGOs. Its terms of reference state: “The taskforce will meet fortnightly, with exact frequency and timings of meetings at the discretion of the chairperson in consultation with the group members.” Its goals are “to develop: proposals to significantly reduce the frequency and impact of sewage discharges from storm overflows short-term actions to accelerate progress to reduce the harm caused by storm overflows”. Last August the group published its storm overflows reduction plan, which gives water companies a deadline of 2035 to reduce the amount of sewage flowing into bathing water and areas of ecological importance. Water companies were given a deadline of 2050 to stop dumping raw sewage elsewhere. The then environment secretary, George Eustice, said water companies would have to invest £56bn over 25 years to tackle storm sewage discharges by 2050. But the plan was heavily criticised as too weak and is to be challenged in court by the Good Law Project and the campaign group WildFish. Since that publication the taskforce has not met again, the freedom of information request shows. The Good Law Project sought all fortnightly meeting dates of the taskforce between 1 April 2022 to 25 April this year, but Defra revealed it had only met once in that time, on 30 August 2022. There have been no follow-up meetings to drive through the storm overflow reduction plan, or to check progress. A Defra spokesperson said: “Our taskforce delivered exactly what it set out to do – develop proposals to significantly reduce the frequency and impact of sewage discharges from storm overflows. This was delivered through our storm overflows discharge reduction plan, which was published in August 2022 and will require the largest infrastructure programme in water company history - £56bn capital investment over 25 years.” England has about 14,500 storm overflows, which are supposed to be used in exceptionally heavy rain to stop the sewage system backing up into people’s homes. But water companies have been routinely dumping raw sewage into rivers and seas even in periods of dry weather. In 2021 the taskforce published a report that estimated the cost of cutting millions of hours of raw sewage discharges from storm overflows would be between £150bn and £660bn – figures that were challenged by some experts. Emma Dearnaley, the legal director at the Good Law Project, said: “We now know that the government’s storm overflows taskforce has met only once since April 2022 – and not at all since its plan was published. That is, unfortunately, typical of this government’s laid-back approach to the sewage crisis blighting our country. “We need the government to impose tougher measures to stop water companies from polluting our waters and bring this unacceptable situation to an end. That is why we are supporting a legal challenge to try to compel the government to put in place a much more robust and urgent plan.” Ashley Smith, of the Windrush Against Sewage Pollution group, said: “[The taskforce] produced precisely what it was designed to do – nothing. We need an independent inquiry now to make sure this disgraceful scam on the public and environment is ended and never repeated.” A Defra spokesperson said: “Our taskforce delivered exactly what it set out to do – develop proposals to significantly reduce the frequency and impact of sewage discharges from storm overflows. This was delivered through our Storm Overflows Discharge Reduction Plan, which was published in August 2022 and will require the largest infrastructure programme in water company history - £56 billion capital investment over 25 years.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a978', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-at-all-time-high-study-finds', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Global greenhouse gas emissions at all-time high, study finds', 'lead': 'Scientists say world is burning through ‘carbon budget’ that can be emitted while staying below 1.5C', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey in Bonn', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 08:00:01', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562407', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/fee83f1b58614d803ef64e21eaf98295440282b9/0_361_7360_4418/500.jpg', 'body': 'Greenhouse gas emissions have reached an all-time high, threatening to push the world into “unprecedented” levels of global heating, scientists have warned. The world is rapidly running out of “carbon budget”, the amount of carbon dioxide that can be poured into the atmosphere if we are to stay within the vital threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures, according to a study published in the journal Earth System Science Data on Thursday. Only about 250bn tonnes of carbon dioxide can now be emitted, to avoid the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere that would raise temperatures by 1.5C. That is down from 500bn tonnes just a few years ago, and at current annual rates of greenhouse gas emissions, of about 54bn tonnes a year over the past decade, it would run out well before the end of this decade. Prof Piers Forster, the director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, and lead author of the paper, said: “This is the critical decade for climate change. Decisions made now will have an impact on how much temperatures will rise and the degree and severity of impacts we will see as a result.” He said the rate of annual increase in emissions had slowed down, but far stronger action was needed. “We need to change policy and approaches in light of the latest evidence about the state of the climate system. Time is no longer on our side,” he said. Governments are meeting in Bonn to prepare for a major UN summit on the climate, Cop28, this November in the United Arab Emirates. Cop28 is seen as one of the last opportunities for the world to get on track to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and stay within 1.5C. Sultan Al Jaber, the president-designate of Cop28, will arrive at Bonn on Thursday, under pressure to produce a plan for the talks that will achieve the “course correction” he has called for. While heading the talks, Al Jaber has retained his role as head of UAE’s national oil company, Adnoc, which is planning to increase its oil and gas production capacity. Al Jaber has previously told the Guardian that his dual role is a benefit to the talks, as he will bring a “business mindset” and galvanise the private sector. Major figures in the talks, including John Kerry of the US and Frans Timmermans of the EU, have praised him. Campaigners remain unconvinced, however, and are planning a protest in Bonn on Thursday against the perceived conflict of interest in Al Jaber’s role. At Cop28, nations will undertake a “global stocktake” for the first time since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, to assess whether they are on track to meet their commitments to cut emissions. That stocktake is likely to show the world is far off track, as the paper published on Thursday also shows. Greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise, despite a sharp fall in 2020 when Covid lockdowns were in place in many countries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calculated in 2018 that the world must nearly halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared with 2010 levels, in order to stay within the 1.5C threshold, and reach net zero emissions by 2050. But that calculation rested on an assumption that the world would reduce emissions by about 7% a year during the 2020s. As emissions have continued to rise, the annual rate of decline for emissions will now have to be much steeper to stay within the 1.5C limit. Joeri Rogelj, co-author of the new paper and a professor of climate science at Imperial College London, told the Guardian: “The years of continued high emissions as the updates the remaining carbon budget mean that by now we should be doing more. That means either moving forward the global goal net zero date for CO2 from around 2050 to about 2035, or cutting much deeper by 2030.” Earlier this year, the International Energy Agency found that emissions from energy – the biggest source of emissions – were showing signs of reaching a plateau. But only 18 countries have shown sustained decreases in their emissions. Majid Al Suwaidi, the director general of Cop28 and one of the top aides to Al Jaber, told the Guardian that UAE would not be using the global stocktake to name and shame the nations that were missing their pledges under the Paris agreement, or failing to cut emissions fast enough. “Climate change is one of those things where we’re all interconnected,” he said. “We can’t solve the problem individually. We have to solve as a collective. That’s what makes it difficult. And so there’s no simple bad guy, good guy in this discussion. Everybody has their solutions. Everybody has their ideas. And if we can bring people together behind those sort of common solutions, and drive the agenda behind that, that becomes a real powerful moment. And that’s what we’re trying to achieve at Cop28.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a979', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/do-the-fossil-fuel-industrys-claims-of-australias-gas-fired-future-stack-up', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Do the fossil fuel industry’s claims of Australia’s gas-fired future stack up? | Temperature Check', 'lead': 'Appea’s assertion that gas is indispensable is ludicrous when it’s renewables that are replacing coal', 'author': 'Graham Readfearn', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 05:13:47', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562424', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/bc166cb0611ac2413c9fdfca29a3ab0a9966b17f/0_365_5472_3283/500.jpg', 'body': 'Australia’s gas industry has launched a major public relations campaign to convince the public of three things: their product is clean, indispensable to our lives and crucial in getting the country to net zero. With soft, seductive and reassuring voiceovers, a TV ad shows images of hospitals, farms and city lights with the tagline “Natural gas: keeping the country running.” Running the campaign is the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), whose chief executive, Samantha McCulloch, said the idea was to raise the public’s awareness of the “critical role of gas”. On the campaign website, there are “facts” – lots of them – several of which are only partly true, cherrypicked or ignore the role of fossil gas in loading the atmosphere with methane and CO2 in the middle of a climate crisis that will only get worse with more fossil fuels. So let’s do what any self-respecting factcheck column would do and go and do some factchecking. Gas for electricity “As Australia shuts down coal, gas is picking up the load,” the gas industry says in the advert. “It will help keep Australia running as we transition to a cleaner future,” the ad claims. In a fact sheet, Appea says the “share of gas-fired power generation in Australia’s electricity mix more than doubled between 2000-01 and 2020-21”. The source for that statistic is the government’s Australian Energy Update 2022 report, and taken across two decades, the data agrees with Appea. But in the most recent decade, the same report says gas-fired generation has grown by just 0.2%. The report says: “Natural gas-fired generation in 2020–21 fell nationally to the lowest level in a decade, and in the southern and eastern states which constitute the National Electricity Market, fell to the lowest level seen since the early 2000s.” That is not a story of surging gas-fired power as the Appea campaign suggests, but a flatlining – and remember, too, that more than 80% of the gas produced in Australia is not consumed by Australians at all, but is used for the export of LNG. A main source? In Appea’s television advert, a voiceover says gas is “one of Australia’s main sources for generating electricity”. A fact sheet asks: “What makes that electricity powering Australian homes?” and then says “about a fifth of the electricity we use” comes from burning gas. Right now, about 18% of the electricity generated in Australia comes from gas, according to government statistics. But this figure is heavily skewed by Western Australia, which accounts for half of all gas-fired power generation despite having only 10% of the country’s population. Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, says in the National Electricity Market (covering 90% of the population, that is, everywhere except Western Australia and the Northern Territory) gas generation has fallen about 45% since 2014. In this current financial year so far, gas has been responsible for only 5.6% of electricity generation in the NEM – less than coal, wind, solar and hydro. So if you live anywhere but WA or the NT, then gas doesn’t account for “about a fifth” of the electricity you use, but more like “an eighteenth” – which isn’t quite as impressive. Mark Ogge, a principal adviser at The Australia Institute, says the amount of gas-fired electricity used by Australians in their homes is likely even less, because “gas industry uses around one-fifth of the electricity generated in Australia to run its LNG export terminals”. “So really, [Appea] is claiming electricity generation has increased largely because the gas industry is using more electricity to export Australia’s gas.” Future role for gas The Appea advert says gas “will help keep Australia running as we transition to a cleaner future”. The Australian Energy Market Operator’s main plan to decarbonise the NEM does say gas will have an important role as a standby in case of shortages in solar, wind, hydro power and battery storage. The plan says that by 2050, there will be about the same amount of gas-fired capacity then as there is now. But the word “capacity” should not be confused with how much gas will actually be used. Dr Dylan McConnell, an energy systems analyst at the University of New South Wakes, says the most recent forecast from AEMO says that by 2040, the actual amount of gas being used for power generation will be about one-third of what it was in 2015. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Gas is cleaner … than what? One of the central facts in Appea’s campaign is that gas is “50% cleaner” than coal (which, as McConnell says, would be great if we only needed to reduce emissions by 50%). Appea says the source for this fact is an International Energy Agency report on gas and a 2017 report on the future of the electricity market from former chief scientist Dr Alan Finkel. Hare says more up-to-date data from the NEM shows gas has 61% of the emissions of coal for each unit of power generated, not 50%. But there are other issues here. Comparing the emissions of gas to coal is moot because Australia has very likely built its last coal-fired power plant. Those coal plants still running are being turned off. Tristan Edis, an energy analyst at Green Energy Markets, says it is renewables that are replacing coal, not gas. He said: “How is it possible that gas is replacing coal, when gas is declining? It’s a logical impossibility. The only thing that’s increasing is wind and solar generation.” So the most pertinent comparison to the emissions of gas should be to renewables. McConnell points to industry data used by Aemo for new gas-fired power that might come into the system, showing the cleanest plants would emit about 377kg of CO2 for every unit of power produced (not counting emissions from extraction, transportation and any leaks of methane along the way). That compares with essentially zero for renewables (again, not counting for energy used to make and transport the turbines or solar panels). Indispensable gas? Appea’s campaign might leave the average viewer with the idea that gas is indispensable. The campaign has a laundry list of products and processes that currently use gas – everything from producing fabrics to powering hospitals and providing hot showers (many of which can be done without the need for burning fossil gas). In one fact sheet, the campaign uses a quote from Prof Michael Brear, director of the Melbourne Energy Institute, that says an “all technology hands on deck approach” will be needed for Australia to reach net zero, and this will include doubling the capacity of gas-fired electricity generation to support renewables. The quote was taken from a media release about the results of a major effort to model a net zero future for Australia which includes all energy use in the country – not just for generating electricity. So what does that report say about gas? All five of the net zero scenarios show gas use declining in Australia. When it comes to energy exported, only one scenario shows a growth in gas exports. But that scenario assumes a domestic carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry will emerge, and will have the capacity to store 1100Mt of CO2 every year. Is that a lot? For context, that is more than 25 times the amount of CCS storage that is currently operational around the globe. Hare says: “Appea makes strong and hyperbolic claims as to the importance of gas for economic activities but does not at all discuss the potential for replacement of gas through efficiency and electrification. “All sectors have opportunities to replace gas, including those that are most carbon-intensive, through improved efficiency, changes in processes and electrification with renewable power.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a97a', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/the-planets-economist-has-kate-raworth-found-a-model-for-sustainable-living', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'The planet’s economist: has Kate Raworth found a model for sustainable living?', 'lead': '<strong>The long read</strong>: Her hit book Doughnut Economics laid out a path to a greener, more equal society.

Sleek and nearly silent, it is a good example of how far the world has progressed in fighting the climate crisis. Its carbon footprint is around three times smaller than its petrol equivalent, and unlike a regular car, it emits none of the greenhouse gases that warm the planet or noxious fumes that pollute the air. That’s the good news. Then consider that the battery of an electric car uses 8kg of lithium, likely extracted from briny pools on South America’s salt flats, a process that has been blamed for shrinking pasturelands and causing desertification. The 14kg of cobalt that prevent the car’s battery from overheating have probably come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where cobalt mines have contaminated water supplies and soil. As the demand for electric vehicles grows, the mining and refining of their components will intensify, further damaging natural ecosystems. By 2040, according to the International Energy Agency, the global demand for lithium will have increased more than fortyfold. Electric cars improve on the status quo without transforming its rapacious use of resources. Subsidised by governments and promoted by the automotive industry, they fit smoothly with the economic ideas that guide how policymakers think about reducing carbon emissions. According to the idea of “green growth”, whose adherents include the World Bank and the White House, so long as the right policies are in place, societies will be able to enjoy endless growth while reducing their carbon footprint. Growth, the process by which a country increases the amount of goods and services it produces, is supposed to raise people’s wages and provide governments with an income that can be invested into public services such as schools and hospitals. To proponents of green growth, new innovations such as electric cars will help “decouple” growth from carbon emissions and allow humans to live a life of plenty within the limits of the planet. That’s the theory, at least. But there is little evidence that this will be possible on the timescale required. Global carbon emissions have risen to their highest levels in history. Recently, researchers have warned that the Earth may already be past its safe limits for humanity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, preventing irreversible damage to the natural environment depends on holding the world below 1.5C of warming, and climate scientists calculate that the emissions of high-income countries need to decrease at 10 times their current rate to achieve this. Electric cars will be essential to this, but if nations are to meet stringent emissions targets and avoid soaring electricity demand, there will need to be fewer cars on the road. The problem is that there are few templates for an economy that radically shrinks the world’s carbon footprint without also shrinking our quality of life. The economist Kate Raworth believes she has a solution. It is possible, she argues, to design an economy that allows humans and the environment to thrive. Doing so will mean rejecting much of what defined 20th-century economics. This is the essential premise of her only book, Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century Economist, which became a surprise hit when it was published in 2017. The book, which has been translated into 21 languages, brings to mind a charismatic professor dispensing heterodox wisdom to a roomful of students. “Citizens of 2050 are being taught an economic mindset that is rooted in the textbooks of 1950, which in turn are rooted in the theories of 1850,” Raworth writes. By exposing the flaws in these old theories, such as the idea that economic growth will massively reduce inequality, or that humans are merely self-interested individuals, Raworth wants to show how our thinking has been constrained by economic concepts that are fundamentally unsuited to the great challenges of this century. To Raworth, the ideal economy of the future can be captured in a single image: a ring doughnut. Its outer crust represents an ecological limit, while its inner ring represents a social foundation. To step beyond the ecological limit will damage the environment beyond repair. To fall below the social foundation will mean some people go without the things they need to live well, such as food, housing or income. Her argument is that economies must be designed so they operate inside this ring, enabling humans and the environment to flourish. The doughnut is premised on three central ideas: the economy should distribute wealth fairly, regenerate the resources that it uses, and allow people to prosper. None of this, Raworth argues, should depend on economic growth. In the hands of another writer, this could feel technical and remote, but Raworth approaches it with nimble metaphors and a chatty, playful disposition. Part of the book’s appeal is its implied message that intractable problems could be resolved were they only framed differently. “By revealing old ideas that have entrapped us and replacing them with new ones to inspire us,” Raworth writes, the book proposes a “new economic story”. She mentions numerous pioneering experiments, such as the city of Oberlin, Ohio, which is trying to sequester more carbon than it produces, thus bringing its environmental impact within the doughnut’s ecological ceiling, or Bangladesh’s attempts to become the first “solar-powered nation”, gainfully employing women to install renewable energy systems in their villages. Raworth concedes that huge political changes, including clamping down on tax havens, will be necessary to keep economies within the ring of the doughnut. Her propositions feature “no immediate answers for what to do next”, she concedes, nor “specific policy prescriptions or institutional fixes”. The book is less of a political programme than a provocation to think beyond capitalism’s imperatives. “Most things begin here. In the mind, in the mindset,” Raworth told a recent audience at an event in Amsterdam, tapping her head for emphasis. To her critics, a shift in mindset is all very well and good, but it is not enough. The reason we haven’t built a fairer, less destructive economy is not because of a failure to tell a better story, they argue, but because politicians bend to the will of corporations and elites, which have little interest in allowing the status quo to change. According to this view, change is not the product of new ideas so much as a political struggle to impose ideas upon the world. Raworth is meeting these criticisms head on. In 2019, in an attempt to make her ideas a reality, she founded the Doughnut Economics Action Lab, a social enterprise that helps bring communities into the doughnut’s ring. It is working with local governments and communities across 70 cities, from Nanaimo on the west coast of Canada to Ipoh in Malaysia, to put the principles of doughnut economics into practice. Now, she faces the difficulty of turning a small set of experiments pioneered by well-intentioned and likeminded people into something far bigger and more transformative. * * * When Raworth arrived at Oxford University to study politics, philosophy and economics in 1990, the only mention of the environment on her course was in an optional paper called Public Economics. Whereas the economists of the early 20th century tended to see their subject as a social science, many of their successors regarded themselves more like physicists, whose job was to uncover the laws that supposedly governed how the economy worked. In her first year, Raworth studied with Andrew Graham, one of the few economists at Oxford to take issue with the narrowing purview of the discipline. Graham liked to ask students questions about real economic events, such as why city centres decline, or whether the “Thatcher experiment” had altered Britain’s growth prospects. “If you want to study economising, you can throw all the maths at it that you like,” Graham told me. “If you want to study economies, you have to embed yourself in the real world.” In her second year, Raworth wrote a paper on the idea of development. “It struck me that it was the first time in my economics degree that we’d discussed what success looked like,” she recalled. “Until that point, it was just implicit that success was about economic growth.” In the early 90s, most people without access to life’s essentials lived in underdeveloped economies, and most economists agreed that growth was the best lever to improve their lives. As banks opened and businesses started investing, transport networks would emerge and education programmes would train workers to do new jobs that paid them higher wages, which governments could then tax back to pay for public services. Few considered the natural resources that all of this would consume, or that the Earth did not have the capacity to sustain endless growth. In 1995, after graduating from Oxford, Raworth moved to Zanzibar, an island off the coast of Tanzania, to take up a development fellowship, part of a scheme that recruited young economists to work as civil servants in poor countries. At the time, Zanzibar was being transformed by tourists, who flew there to stay in the new hotels along its beachfronts. Visitors might have imagined Zanzibar as a landscape of tropical profusion, with its coconut palms, seafood and mango trees, but its ecosystem was delicate. The longer she spent on the island, the more Raworth was bothered by the waste created by the island’s booming tourist economy. Single-use plastic bags had recently been introduced, and their bright blue remnants became tangled on the beaches. “I didn’t have the framework to describe it, but this plastic was just arriving and arriving, and there was no system for collecting or managing it,” she recalled. “I had this real frustration that we were praising countries for their development, and yet saying nothing about the ecological damage that was going on in order to achieve that.” After three years in Zanzibar, Raworth moved to New York to begin work as a researcher on the UN’s annual Human Development report, a project that ranked the world’s nations not by their GDP but by their citizens’ quality of life. While working on a report about consumption, Raworth read a book called How Much Is Enough? by Alan Durning, an American environmentalist. The book posed an urgent question: “Is it possible for all the world’s people to live comfortably without bringing on the decline of the planet’s natural health?” The only way to achieve this, Durning contended, was by buying less stuff – fewer fridge-freezers, tumble dryers, hair lotions and television sets. But few would be willing to accept the reduction in living standards that this would entail. “I remember reading about the data – our use of plastics, our use of materials – and I was like, this is what I’ve been missing,” Raworth told me. In conversation, Raworth has a generous tendency to point towards the work of other economists and thinkers, as if showing you the cherished contents of a jewellery box. Sitting at her kitchen table in Oxford last autumn, she told me excitedly about the scientists who had first quantified how economic activity was exceeding the Earth’s capacity to support it. Earlier attempts to measure this impact were constrained by the availability of data, which was limited to specific events, such as acid rain or the depletion of the ozone layer. Then, in 2009, a group of researchers in Stockholm produced a circular diagram that identified nine of the planet’s life-supporting systems, from biodiversity to freshwater reserves. Each of these systems had its limits, which, if crossed, could cause irreversible damage. Raworth came across the diagram in 2009, buried in a colleague’s PowerPoint presentation, when she was working as a researcher at Oxfam. She was living in Britain with her husband Roman Krznaric, an Australian philosopher who she’d met in New York, and had just returned from maternity leave looking after their new twins. “I remember sitting at my desk, and I was like, bam! This is the beginning of 21st-century economics,” she recalled. “It begins with this.” * * * Last autumn, I travelled with Raworth to the south-eastern outskirts of Amsterdam. She had been invited as the honorary guest at the second annual “doughnut festival” organised by a network of community groups based in the city, and I had tagged along in the hope of better understanding how her ideas might work in practice. From the vantage of the elevated metro, gabled Dutch terraces gave way to grey housing estates and the skyline gradually began to resemble any other European metropolis. Raworth was wearing a green puffer jacket to guard against the cold outside. Her uniform of dark trousers, durable shoes and block-coloured blouses is smart but muted, as if designed to strike a balance between the demands of a Ted talk and a climate protest. Necklaces are one of her few concessions to whimsy; today, she was wearing one in the shape of a sugar snap pea. Raworth’s ideas have found a large audience in the Netherlands. In April 2020, Marieke van Doorninck, then Amsterdam’s councillor for sustainability, announced the city would be basing its sustainability policies on Raworth’s doughnut. The declaration suggested a radical departure from the status quo. The BBC released a video explaining how the Dutch were “reshaping their post-pandemic utopia”; Time magazine asked whether Amsterdam was about to replace capitalism. Yet the changes that have happened in Amsterdam are smaller than initial coverage implied. More businesses in the city are committed to reusing materials, and more buildings are to be made out of wood. There seemed to be a tension between the grand vision of Raworth’s book and the modest changes that bear its name. Members of Amsterdam’s Green party, De Groenen, who I spoke with, along with members of its Doughnut Coalition, a network that is trying to put Raworth’s ideas into practice, shared a conviction that truly decarbonising the economy would mean not just cutting emissions but confronting inequalities of wealth and power. When I asked Van Doorninck how the doughnut differed from other sustainability policies, she explained by way of example. “I love the fact that I have a shop around the corner that sells sneakers made from old plastic bottles,” she told me. “But my first question should be: do I need new sneakers?” Van Doorninck worried that the prevailing mode of sustainability involved simply buying different things rather than confronting the economic assumptions that brought about environmental and social disaster in the first place. It is all too easy to imagine a future in which the wealthy continue to buy recycled sneakers, offset their carbon emissions and live in air-purified homes, while the poor suffer the worst effects of food scarcity and wildfires. The prospect of such a future – less carbon-intensive, according to some narrow metrics, but by no means fair – is precisely why Raworth argues we must view social and environmental problems side by side. Raworth’s itinerary in Amsterdam was an indication of how her ideas have travelled. When she first visited the city after the publication of Donuteconomie in 2018, she was invited to speak at cultural venues in the city centre. Today, we were going to Gaasperdam, a low-income suburb, for the opening event of the Doughnut festival. Later, Raworth was due at a city farm; the following day she had an appointment at a shopping mall to see a recycling plant, and a meeting with an artist who made sculptures in the shape of doughnuts. As the metro sped across the city, I asked Raworth about whether she ever used other modes of transport. She had taken the Eurostar to Amsterdam, and when I had visited her home in Oxford a few months earlier, the parking bay outside was decorated with colourful chalk drawings – a celebration, she said, of her family no longer owning a car. Raworth doesn’t fly, though she made an exception in 2021 for a family trip to Australia to see her husband’s father. When she is invited to speak in places that can’t be reached by train, she dials in via Zoom. “The downside of not flying and only getting trains is that, of course, you then have a very Eurocentric perspective,” she acknowledged. When we arrived in Gaasperdam, we were met by Anne Stijkel, a community organiser and former scientist who lives and works in the area. In 2019, Stijkel came up with a plan to translate Raworth’s ideas into tangible action. The first Doughnut Deal trained a group of women to sew curtains that helped insulate homes on a housing estate, ticking two boxes in the doughnut’s social foundation by giving local people paid work and cheaper energy bills, while reducing their use of gas and bringing them closer in line with the doughnut’s ecological ceiling. Today, the community was signing a pledge to create a generator that would turn waste – “shit”, as Stijkel repeated delightedly – into biogas. In the foyer of a community centre, a table had been laid with doughnut-shaped cakes baked in a vibrant shade of green. Stijkel showed us to a hall where a piece of rope was arranged in the shape of a doughnut on the floor. At its centre was a flame powered by biogas that licked the sides of a glass tube. The circle, the flame and the rope gave a ceremonial, almost pagan impression. A group of people gathered in the hall and Stijkel told them to stand in pairs in the circle, back to back, and take turns reading out cards that had been placed in front of them. Each card listed one of the categories from the inner and outer rings of the doughnut: “gender equality”, “food”, “nitrogen phosphorus loading”. The purpose of the task was unclear to me, but everyone in the room seemed energised and hopeful. A kind of childlike excitement, along with a relentless inquisitiveness, extends to everything in Raworth’s life. She asked questions of everyone she met in Amsterdam and never seemed to tire of the endless numbers of people who wanted to shake her hand, or tell her about the thesis of their PhD. This capacity to generate affection and make people feel seen belies an analytic intelligence and solitary focus. Raworth grew up in west London, and attended St Paul’s Girls, a highly academic private school. Her sister, Sophie, who is now a BBC newsreader, wrote in this newspaper in 2006: “As teenagers we didn’t understand each other or get on at all. Kate was painfully shy … She was very self-conscious and shut herself away, reading, playing the saxophone and doing art while I was going out to parties. I needed people more than she does. She doesn’t need anyone’s approval.” * * * In my conversations with economists and environmentalists who had worked with Raworth, her ideas were described as inspiring and quixotic. “Doughnut Economics is a real testament to her ability to tell stories, engage people and convey economics,” Tim Jackson, a sustainability economist at the University of Surrey, told me. But, Jackson continued, like any small and hopeful experiment in doing things differently, the doughnut will inevitably face larger obstacles, whether a privatised rail network so expensive that it forces people to drive cars, or a finance sector that continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels. Rather than speaking about political conflict and “us v them”, Raworth prefers to focus on “we”; rather than talking about parties or elections, she talks about “design”. She eschews terms such as socialism or communism and seems to put little faith in Britain’s current crop of elected politicians. This approach has drawn criticism from others in her field who see it as a sign of naivety about the way power works. In a review of her book, Branko Milanović, an economist who researches inequality, accused Raworth of “we-ism”, of presuming that everyone on Earth shared the same objectives. This, he argued, was why she was able to make claims that were unfeasibly optimistic. While Raworth acknowledges that growth is needed in poorer countries, Milanović thought it implausible that people in richer countries would ever vote for low or no growth. “Short of magic,” he wrote, “this is not going to happen.” “Doughnut Economics is all about action. We’re not sitting having academic debates back and forth about the meaning of words,” Raworth said when I put these criticisms to her. “It’s time to be propositional, and sometimes the best form of protest is to propose something new.” To her supporters, the fact that no national government has adopted the doughnut as a substantive policy agenda is not an indictment of Raworth’s ideas, but of our governing classes. Despite plentiful evidence that the pursuit of growth has accelerated the climate crisis, contributed to rising inequality and failed to secure decent living standards even for many people in rich countries, politicians of all varieties still treat it as a panacea. Like her avoidance of political labels, Raworth’s own position on growth seems formulated to avoid alienating potential allies. “She is very carefully on the fence,” Duncan Green, a former colleague of Raworth’s at Oxfam, told me. Raworth describes herself as “agnostic” on growth: she holds that economies should promote human prosperity regardless of whether GDP is going up, down, or holding steady. “She agonised over using that word, agnostic, because you could have just said, ‘Don’t go for growth,’” Nigel Wilcockson, her editor at Penguin Books, told me. “At one end of the political spectrum, people say ‘an economy without growth is impossible’, and on the other end, people say ‘that’s fine for this set of nations that are doing well, but what about everyone else?’” After the event in Gaasperdam, Raworth returned to central Amsterdam for a meeting with civil servants from Grenoble. They had travelled from the foot of the French Alps to learn how their city, which received an EU award for its green credentials in 2022, could become even greener by applying Raworth’s ideas. Antoine Back, the city’s deputy mayor, seemed nervous, even starstruck, to be sitting next to her. On the table in front of him was his well-thumbed copy of La Théorie du Donut, which he later asked Raworth to sign. The civil servants sat around a long table and discussed doughnut economics over cups of peppermint tea. Back, a self-described “eco-Marxist” with a debonair haircut, told Raworth that they had mapped issues such as food poverty, air quality and car use in Grenoble, in an attempt to show how the city was failing to stay within the doughnut. “We have entered the Anthropocene,” said Back with a dramatic inflection. “This won’t be gentle; there will be ruptures, shocks.” Raworth gently suggested that new, less doom-laden words and images would be needed to describe the future. Because there are so few models for a low-growth economy that do not entail returning to an era before industrialisation, it has been easy for critics to portray any attempt to shrink our ecological footprint as an assault on social progress. In the UK, one recent proposal to limit car traffic was accused of trying to “reinvent feudalism” and return humanity to an age when people never left their villages. The ease with which those sceptical of growth are treated as heretics or hair-shirted hippies is part of the reason Raworth treads delicately, and focuses on more upbeat visions of life in a low-growth economy. “There is a phrase I really like, which is ‘public luxury and private sufficiency’,” she told Back, pointing to Amsterdam’s generous bike lanes and tram system as examples of the luxuries that could be part of the solution to the climate crisis. Over the past few years, a number of economists and academics have spoken out more forcefully against growth. Proponents of “degrowth”, a theory which has spawned its own sphere of conferences, journals and publications, argue that the world’s rich economies need to shrink, using less energy and fewer resources. To achieve this, consumption must be curtailed and wellbeing should be put ahead of profit. In rich nations, this would amount to a planned reduction of energy and resources to bring the economy back into balance with nature while reducing inequality. These ideas are not dissimilar to Doughnut Economics. “It’s not the intellectual position I have a problem with,” Raworth wrote in 2015. “It’s the name.” She views degrowth as a “smoke bomb” that confuses more than it explains, redirecting conversations about where humanity is headed down a rabbit hole of debate. On a burning planet, we do not have enough time for such endless discussions, she suggests. “There comes a time for the smoke to clear, and for a beacon to guide us all through the haze: something positive to aim for,” she wrote. * * * The week after we met in Amsterdam, Raworth travelled to Birmingham to give a talk at a community centre about putting the doughnut into practice. We took the train with Rob Shorter, an employee at the Doughnut Economics Action Lab, and Raworth’s daughter Siri, an intelligent, quiet teenager. Raworth was carrying a reusable shopping bag full of props: a hosepipe, a rolled-up piece of pipe lagging and a geodesic Hoberman ball that looked like a toy from the 1980s. She and Shorter were planning on trying out a new presentation involving blue plastic balls and tangerines. The tangerines, Shorter explained, would symbolise the living, biological materials on Earth that naturally regenerate, such as plants and fruit trees. The blue balls would stand in for the resources whose production carried an environmental cost, such as plastics and metals, which need to be repaired and recycled so they can be used again. The idea was to show how the current “linear” economy – which burns up resources and spits out carbon – should instead become a “circular” economy, where resources are reused and nature is regenerated. Shorter suggested they could throw the tangerines on the floor to symbolise waste. Raworth wasn’t so sure: “Throwing balls is OK – but I don’t like the idea of throwing and wasting food.” The event in Birmingham was hosted by Civic Square, a social enterprise that works with low-income local communities and hosts coffee mornings and community festivals organised by people with enticing job titles such as Doughnut Storyteller and Dream Matter Designer. “You can’t just keep shouting from the parapets, or relying on governments to legislate,” Imandeep Kaur, the founder of Civic Square, told me. “You have to put people at the forefront of the story, so they can actually take part in it.” In the future the enterprise intends to repurpose empty high-street spaces for the use of local communities, and to build a new public square. For now, they make do with a floating barge where visitors can read copies of Doughnut Economics over free coffee and cake; on the banks of the canal, they host regular events and a gardening club. We arrived at the venue, where a conference room had been decorated with hand-painted banners that quoted lines from Raworth’s book: “Today’s economy is divisive and degenerative by default. Tomorrow’s economy must be distributive and regenerative by design.” The room seemed to rearrange itself as she moved through it. A beatboxing poet performed a song about the creation of a new economy, and Raworth watched intently, wearing an expression of transfixed delight. Then it was her turn to present. She pulled out the Hoberman ball, its colourful prongs scrunched in the shape of a star. The ball, she said, told a story about our “divisive” economy, which concentrated value in the hands of a few. Raworth tugged at the ball and it bounced into a sphere. The audience let out a collective “oooh”. “Think of that,” she said. “A system that actually shares value, opportunity … and wealth with all those who create it.” Then it was time for the tangerines. Raworth and Shorter handed them to the front row, who passed them backwards, until everyone’s hands were empty. “This is the linear model of industrial production – the ‘take-make-use-lose’ economy,” Raworth said, pausing on one of her signature phrases to let it sink in. Raworth’s critics might have found plenty to be cynical about in this scene – a crowd of adults playing with tangerines in the service of somehow transforming the economy. But the purpose of the presentation, indeed the purpose of every event I attended with Raworth, seemed less about directing participants towards a particular set of actions than expanding their field of vision. When I spoke to Antoine Back via Zoom a few months after we met in Amsterdam, he told me the absence of solutions in Raworth’s work was one of its strengths. “I don’t use the word ‘solution,’” he told me. “It suggests that there is a magic bullet; that technology will come along and save us.” He feared that our tendency to search for irrefutable answers where there are none produces inertia, leading people to believe that it was always someone else’s responsibility to solve the climate crisis. On the train back home from Birmingham, I thought about a conversation in Amsterdam with Ruurd Priester, one of the organisers of the city’s Doughnut Coalition. “Stories and narratives are at the basis of everything we do,” he told me. I asked him whether the popularity of Raworth’s ideas stemmed from the way they licensed belief – or hope – in the possibility of an alternative to what we have now. “I really like that way of putting it – a belief system,” he said. “It’s not just about the economy. It’s also about how economical thinking has started to dominate the ways you think about yourself, and what you think is even possible.” On Wednesday 5 July, join Zoe Williams and a panel of leading thinkers for a livestreamed discussion on the ideas that can make our economies fairer.

From the war in Ukraine to the death of entire languages, our understanding of how threats to the ocean reflect threats to humanity itself is constantly evolving. Here are some of the stories we have covered over the past 12 months. The hidden underwater forests that could help tackle the climate crisis Researchers have found that seaweed forests are far more extensive than previously realised. These underwater forests can act as a vital buffer against the climate crisis, absorbing carbon dioxide from seawater and the atmosphere. They could also help efforts to alleviate the world’s food security crisis. Yet they face multiple threats, including rising sea temperatures, pollution and invasive species. Dead dolphins: how nature became a casualty of the Ukraine war Dolphins, egrets, herons and fish are among the casualties of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. With some of the most intense fighting occurring on the southern coast, experts warned last year that marine and wetland environments along the Black and Azov Seas are under particular threat. The uninsurables: storms and rising seas make coastlines unlivable Over the past 15 years, insurance claims from severe weather events in Canada have more than quadrupled. People in some coastal communities now face a blunt reality: many homes are, in effect, uninsurable, and the changing climate will only make that problem worse in a country where most major cities are built along rivers and coastlines or on flood plains. Offshore fish farms: the ‘wild west’ of ocean pollution? Fish farms have appeared offshore in many places around the world in recent years, sparking a heated debate about their impact on the planet and the welfare of fish. “There are obvious ways you can do it poorly,” says Steve Gaines, at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “But it can be done well, and the technology is there to do it well. It’s really important – it has lots of implications in terms of the next 30 years and more of the planet.” The profound link between the climate crisis and the ocean Ahead of Cop27, Climate Visuals released a new collection of evidence-based images showing the impact of climate on marine environments. This selection shows everything from an upturned iceberg in the Weddell Sea to fishermen praying for a benevolent sea on the island of Dublar Char in Bangladesh. ‘Race against time’: shipwrecks hold clues to humanity’s future More than 3m vessels are believed to be scattered across the ocean floor, offering tales of triumph and disaster that stretch back millennia. OceanGate Expeditions, which takes researchers and paying customers to the Titanic, envisions a frontline role for the shipwreck in demystifying how the oceans are changing. “How the ocean responds to climate change is going to dictate everything. We need to understand it,” says Stockton Rush, the company’s president. Lost for words: fears of ‘catastrophic’ language loss due to rising seas “Many small linguistic communities are on islands and coastlines vulnerable to hurricanes and sea-level rise,” says Anastasia Riehl, director of the Strathy language unit at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. Others live in areas where rising temperatures threaten traditional farming and fishing practices, prompting migration. “When climate change comes in, it disrupts communities even more,” she adds. “It has a multiplier effect – the final nail in the coffin.” The creeping threat of the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt Vast fields of sargassum, a brown seaweed, have bloomed in the Atlantic. Fed by human activity such as intensive soya farming in the Congo, Amazon and Mississippi, which dumps nitrogen and phosphorus into the ocean, the sargassum explosion is by far the biggest seaweed bloom on the planet. The Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt, as it is known, is visible from space, stretching like a sea monster across the ocean, with its nose in the Gulf of Mexico and its tail in the mouth of the Congo River. “I think I’ve replaced my climate-change anxiety with sargassum anxiety,” says Patricia Estridge, head of Seaweed Generation, a UK startup working to make seaweed commercially viable. South-east Asia fights back to save corals In south-east Asia, the health of marine and coastal ecosystems is in serious decline, but researchers and communities are joining forces to secure a future for coming generations. “We need to inspire people [to care] about our reefs. Together we can change the attitude of the past and work to make a difference,” says Ketut Gina in Bali, Indonesia, who collaborates with the Dutch conservation organisation Coral Reef Care and offers diving courses to people who want to work in marine restoration. ‘Six times the size of Yosemite’: the new tribal sanctuary off the California coast The Chumash people have spent decades fighting to turn 156 miles of coastline in central California into a national marine sanctuary, which would grant it federal protection. Not only would it preserve marine life, from sea otters to kelp forests, but the proposed sanctuary would safeguard Chumash traditions. If successful, it would be the first sanctuary on the US mainland nominated and led by a tribe. Shipping’s dirty secret: how ‘scrubbers’ clean the air – while contaminating the sea The shipping industry was faced with the choice of switching to cleaner but pricier fuel, or installing a system to clean exhaust gases – known as “scrubbers” – that dump the chemicals removed from the exhaust directly into the sea instead. Scrubbers are dirty and dirt cheap, but as of 2020 more than 4,300 ships globally had installed them – up from 732 ships in 2018. The cost of buying and fitting a scrubber is £1.5m-£5m, whereas cleaner fuel costs £250-£400 a tonne. The scrubber pays for itself within a year. “It’s been a loophole for industry to continue burning the cheapest, dirtiest fuels,” says Lucy Gilliam, of Seas at Risk, an association of European environmental organisations. The first great energy transition: how humanity gave up whale oil For generations, the whale was an indispensable resource. Yet within just a few decades, half the global economy was restructured. Rarely in history has there been such a complete and radical reversal in the use of a natural resource. And, while humanity threw everything it had at the whale, most populations have now recovered to some extent. It may be helpful to remember that what was needed, above all else, was for people to take an interest and get involved. The end of industrial whaling was an epochal change but, in retrospect, it came almost overnight.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a97c', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/fact-check-why-rowan-atkinson-is-wrong-about-electric-vehicles', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Fact check: why Rowan Atkinson is wrong about electric vehicles', 'lead': 'Last week we ran a piece by Rowan Atkinson casting doubt on the environmental benefits of electric vehicles.

In support of his contention, however, Atkinson repeats a series of repeatedly debunked talking points, often used by those seeking to delay action on the climate crisis. Moreover, he suggests alternatives to EVs that are not yet widely available, would be less beneficial to the climate and are guaranteed to be more costly. Atkinson’s biggest mistake is his failure to recognise that electric vehicles already offer significant global environmental benefits, compared with combustion-engine cars. While EVs won’t solve all of the problems associated with car use – from traffic congestion through to our increasingly sedentary lifestyles – they are an essential part of tackling the climate emergency. In its latest report, for example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said, with “high confidence”, that EVs have lower greenhouse gas emissions than conventional cars. The IPCC said that electric vehicles not only “offer the greatest low-carbon potential for land-based transport”, but their use would save money. (Despite elevated electricity prices, EVs are still much cheaper to run than petrol cars in the UK.) Indeed, without a widespread shift to EVs, there is no plausible route to meeting the UK’s legally binding target of net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050 – and the same is true globally. Contrary to Atkinson’s article, EVs cut emissions in the “bigger picture” taking into account vehicles’ full life cycles, from the extraction of oil or mining of lithium for batteries through to actually driving the cars. As Carbon Brief noted some years ago, EVs already cut planet-warming emissions by two-thirds on a life cycle basis relative to combustion engine cars in the UK – and the benefits are growing. Atkinson cites Volvo figures showing emissions from producing EVs to be 70% higher. This is misdirection. While many details of the Volvo study have been thoroughly debunked, the more important issue is that the emissions from producing batteries, while significant, are quickly outweighed by the CO2 emissions from fuelling petrol and diesel cars. Atkinson is also wrong to say that the UK government’s plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 “seems to be based on conclusions drawn from only one part of a car’s operating life: what comes out of the exhaust pipe”. For starters, the government’s cost-benefit analysis of its policy plans for cars talks in detail about life cycle emissions. Specifically, it mentions government-commissioned research that proves EVs offer a large and growing emissions benefit on a life cycle basis. Echoing Carbon Brief’s findings, the analysis says: “BEVs [battery electric vehicles] are expected to reduce GHG emissions by 65% compared to a petrol car today, and this rises to 76% by 2030.” That same analysis gives one answer to Atkinson’s touting of hydrogen as an “interesting alternative fuel” to replace petrol and diesel. The research shows that hydrogen vehicles would only cut emissions by 39% today, relative to petrol engines, potentially rising to 56% by 2030. Another answer is that there are still only 72,000 hydrogen-fuelled fuel-cell vehicles on the planet, accounting for a tiny fraction of the roughly 1.5bn cars on the road globally. In comparison, about 14m EVs are due to be sold this year alone, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Even Toyota, the carmarker most closely associated with pushing hydrogen vehicles and cited in Atkinson’s article, has recently started to follow the rest of the market in shifting towards EVs. Atkinson goes on to suggest hydrogen for trucks, inaccurately claiming electrification is a “non-starter” due to the weight of batteries. Yet manufacturers sold 60,000 electric trucks last year and now have 220 heavy-duty vehicle models on the market, according to the IEA. European electric truck sales grew fourfold in the first quarter of this year alone, according to Volvo. As Auke Hoekstra at the Eindhoven University of Technology has argued, electric trucks will not have a major weight disadvantage over diesels. More importantly, says Hoekstra, they will be much cheaper to own and run. The main problem with hydrogen vehicles is the same as for the “synthetic fuel” that Atkinson is also keen to promote. Specifically, both of these alternatives are incredibly inefficient, requiring many times more energy to drive the same distance. Figures from NGO Transport and Environment show EVs can be driven two to five times further on the same energy as would be needed if using hydrogen or synthetic fuels. This thermodynamic disadvantage inevitably makes these alternatives much more costly to run than EVs. A few of Atkinson’s other claims are worth mentioning. He says EV batteries only last “about 10 years”. Yet “most modern lithium-ion units are likely to last the lifetime of the car”, according to Autocar. Tesla’s batteries are “designed to outlast the vehicle”. He complains that new cars are only kept for three years before being sold. Yet he does not reference the secondhand market, and the fact that British people are keeping their cars for longer than ever. He claims that it is better to keep running old petrol cars than to replace them with EVs. Yet a new EV would start benefiting the climate in less than four years, relative to an old combustion engine. He claims that lithium-ion batteries contain rare earth elements. They do not. In concluding, Atkinson says people should “hold fire” on EVs. This is linked to the false premise that EVs “will be of real, global environmental benefit one day, but that day has yet to dawn”. The alternatives he promotes are not yet widely available, are less beneficial for the environment – and are thermodynamically guaranteed to be much more costly. In contrast, and contrary to Atkinson’s central claim, EVs already offer significant emissions savings – and their widespread use is central to meeting UK and global climate goals.

We pass a lamp-post charger, which he dismisses as “a smart solution but slow”, and a dedicated but occupied bay for electric vehicle (EV) charging. Here, like much of inner London, there are few homes with driveways for overnight charging, leaving drivers at the mercy of limited public points. “You’ve just got to hope no one’s there when you need it,” he says. This Uber driver can do more than most to tackle the issue: the Guardian is being driven by the firm’s UK general manager, Andrew Brem, licensed to carry passengers since Christmas. Brem is overseeing the installation in east London of the first of 700 Uber-funded public chargers. In terms of converting its fleet to electric vehicles, London is as good as it gets for Uber. The global bosses of the ridesharing firm will host a “sustainability” event in the UK capital on Thursday to announce measures to push greener trips for users and drivers. The chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will take to the Bafta stage to unveil features in the app – with actor Edward Norton, a longtime Uber backer and climate campaigner, flying in to add a little Hollywood fizz. The choice of London is not accidental: a city that leads the way for Uber in electric vehicle uptake, doubling EV numbers since early 2022 to host 10,000 of the 60,000 registered on the app worldwide. Uber has targeted a fully electric fleet in London by the end of 2025 – an ambition that looks a tall order if it hopes to keep the current number of 45,000 registered vehicles in action. The transition is partly facilitated by a £145m clean air fund Uber banked from levies on trips between 2019 and 2022 into individual pots for drivers to buy or subsidise renting an EV, shepherded in by Brem’s predecessor, Jamie Heywood (who now runs a solar power firm in Germany). Brem, meanwhile, isn’t just topping up his salary by driving to get the view from the shop floor; he wanted to go through the process last year when Uber was struggling for drivers as labour shortages bit. Even for a “vanilla” type, as he puts it, with a fixed address and being adept with the admin, the Transport for London licensing process took him eight months. Uber has had an uneasy past with TfL but Brem acknowledges the wider context of city policies as being the major factor in EV growth. The congestion charge and the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) have been significant incentives to electrify – and since the start of 2023, Transport for London has only licensed private hire vehicles that are zero-emissions capable. London has more of the UK’s 43,000 chargers than other regions, and TfL and the mayor, Sadiq Khan, are to unveil more, but the capital’s relative success masks inequalities. Much is in the hands of boroughs – and wealthier boroughs have more public chargers. “Not where I’d argue they are most needed,” Brem says, “in Redbridge, Brent or Newham, where people drive most and where most of our drivers are.” One Uber driver he met has taken to throwing a cable out of the window of his second-floor flat, for convenience and cost-saving: “The difference between charging overnight at home or rocking up to a Tesla supercharger is absolutely enormous.” Returning to the Guardian offices, Brem, the former chief commercial officer of British Airways, forgets to officially end the booked ride as our interview continues. A warning message pops up on his phone, with an invitation to watch an instructional video on sexual harassment policies – a reminder of Uber’s efforts to clean up in other ways after concerns over safety and checks on drivers that saw its London licence imperilled for a second time in 2019. As the Guardian’s collaborative investigation into the company, the Uber files, underlined, the firm has had an unsavoury history of attempting to circumvent rules around the globe. Brem says Uber is a very different place now: “We’ve all seen the movie and read the files. That was the past.” Now, he says, they “influence with integrity”. He is still not happy about court rulings in Britain that demanded Uber treats drivers as workers. Brem claims those regulations “have not caught up with the gig economy … or are ridiculously bureaucratic or unfair, where competitors are not complying”. But he says Uber follows the rules, whether it likes them or not: “The culture is not conservative or staid but it is nonetheless one that takes obligations very seriously. We just try and change them.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a97e', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/country-diary-we-live-in-hope-of-rain-a-normal-amount-of-rain', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: We live in hope of rain – a normal amount of rain | Anita Roy', 'lead': '<strong>Wellington, Somerset:</strong> Our fragile forest garden just needs some help from above, anything that won’t bake it to dust or wash away the topsoil', 'author': 'Anita Roy', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 04:30:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562515', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d059645e4f7cc9613fb86c081b84851bc26dd31c/0_307_2048_1229/500.jpg', 'body': 'It’s another beautiful day. This sentence doesn’t usually elicit a collective groan of despair, but after three arid weeks, the gardeners of south-west England are entitled to sigh a bit. In my local Fox’s Field, volunteers from Wellington’s Transition Town group are hauling water from the stream up the slope to carefully rehydrate the herbs in their newly planted forest garden. The ground is covered with a layer of woodchip, hay and municipal soil improver. It has been so toasted by the sun that you can crumble it in your fingers like granola. At intervals, tufts of green poke up through the mulch: oregano and lemon balm, bergamot and sweet cicely, chamomile and clary sage. Over the past month, 273 plants have been planted, with 198 still to go, representing hundreds of volunteer hours, and costing about £1,800 in grant money. There’s a lot at stake. The last rain fell in biblical proportions. On 9 May, the air turned beige, lightning crackled, and thunder rolled from Blackdowns to Quantocks and back again like a timpani section gone mad. The rain, when it finally fell, hammered the freshly ploughed fields, blasting away the topsoil like a pressure washer. Roads turned into rivers, carrying away whatever nutrients farmers had applied, and rivers boiled with frothy Nescafé-coloured water. Half the average month’s rain fell in the space of 24 hours. It’s not so much the quantity as the quality of the rain that’s the issue: a “wet” month isn’t much use if it all falls at once. Quite the opposite, in fact. And after the flood, the run of bone-dry days and chilly nights have made the usually soggy south-west feel like the high sierras. No wonder the plants are struggling. In the forest garden, the team has spent the past 18 months suppressing the grass with cardboard, hay and woodchip, and in one section a huge sheet of black plastic. Not only does this “no dig” method help retain the soil structure, and avoid releasing carbon into the atmosphere as conventional ploughing does, it also provides the soil with a protective layer. It is less likely to dry out, is more stable and absorbent, and therefore richer in nutrients and microbial activity. But if the current conditions prevail, without the intervention of these water-bearing humans, even these lucky plants will eventually die.

The Queensland government on Thursday released the August 2021 review of the national fire ant eradication program, which warned pre-existing measures and funding “will not be able to eradicate or contain” the red fire ant outbreak in Brisbane and surrounds. “In view of the outcomes of the program to date and the current risks of spread, a major change of plan will be needed for any possibility of long term eradication and even for continued mitigation,” the review said. The review uses the word “urgent” 18 times. But since receiving the 2021 report, authorities have not yet publicly committed to a pivot in strategy, or to one of three options the reviewers set out for an intergovernmental steering committee. In that time, fire ants have continued to spread in south-east Queensland, and recent finds on the Gold Coast have raised concerns the pests are moving quickly towards New South Wales. The recommended option is to spend up to $300m a year to eradicate the outbreak of red fire ants before the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. The other options are to “contain and suppress” the current outbreak to south-east Queensland, or to wind down the eradication program. A wind-down would allow fire ants to become established, as they have in parts of the US. The ants are described as a “social menace”, swarm aggressively and inflict a sting that can itch and burn for an hour. In rare cases, people have died from allergic relations. The review said the uncontrolled spread of red fire ants would have an economic impact of up to $2bn a year. The Invasive Species Council said it had campaigned for the release of the report, and that it “reveals Australia’s inadequate response to fire ants”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup “‘Fire ants are an inferno – we need to treat it like the emergency that it is,” Reece Pianta, the council’s fire ant campaigner, said. “The choice is stark. Australia cannot afford to live with a fire ant future, but we are not investing anywhere near enough to prevent it from happening. “Our governments need to pay the fire ant eradication bill now while we can still afford it.” Ashley Bacon, program executive from the National Fire Ant Eradication Program, said a new response plan would be put forward to federal and state agriculture ministers and that “eradication is still the goal”. Addressing questions about whether authorities had dropped the ball in not acting with more urgency to step-up eradication efforts, Bacon said tireless work had been done over the past 18 months. “In addition to that we’ve increased our engagement with community,” he said. “These efforts have resulted in fire ants remaining in south-east Queensland, which the report clearly states wouldn’t be possible [without the program].” The review makes several recommendations, including more aggressive eradication efforts. It said the Queensland government should expand its biosecurity zone to the NSW border and west to the Great Dividing Range, and “urgently scale up communications, engagement and compliance activities throughout the expanded zone”.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a980', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/australia-ski-season-no-snow-skiing-snowboarding-resorts-closed-warm-weather', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Dry run: Australia’s ski season kicks off without snow and El Niño may be to blame', 'lead': 'Despite several cold snaps in May that brought early dustings of snow, a warmer start to winter has meant most of that has now melted', 'author': 'Rafqa Touma', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 02:59:10', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562553', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/526cf4c864a83a068f67e7fcc6822c7f5b03d365/56_0_1640_984/500.jpg', 'body': 'Australia’s ski season will start with no skiing, no snowboarding, no snow – and a drying El Niño may be to blame. Due to a “lack of snow,” Thredbo Resort has closed its mountain to skiing and snowboarding this long weekend, a spokesperson said – just as it kicks off its official winter season. The Bureau of Meteorology placed Australia on “El Niño alert” this week. “If El Nino does develop, it brings an enhanced risk of a drier and warmer winter compared to normal,” senior BOM meteorologist, Angus Hines, said. There is now a 70% chance of the climate system developing before the end of this year – roughly three times the normal chance for the first time since 2016. There were several cold outbreaks in May, which brought below average temperatures and dustings of snow to Thredbo and alpine areas. But snow in May is not always a good indicator of the snow season to come, Hines said. Warm and rainy conditions in recent days have melted much of that snow away. Many alpine regions had seen significant snowfall in late May last year, but Hines said it is not uncommon to have little snow in early June. “Most years the alpine areas don’t begin to build their snow base until June and sometimes later.” A brief surge of showers is forecast for Friday, which could bring a dusting of snow to areas above 1,400m, but “no significant snow is expected”. There is also no snow forecast through the long weekend. From next Tuesday, the next frontal system will move overhead. “Although at this stage, that system doesn’t look like it will bring much or any snowfall,” Hines said. The long-term winter forecast is warmer and drier than average across the alpines, and much of Australia, though Hines said there will still be cold and snowy outbreaks from time to time through the winter months. A Thredbo spokesperson has hope nonetheless: “There is promising snowfall and snowmaking conditions in the seven-day forecast. “We can’t wait to deliver skiing and snowboarding as soon as conditions allow.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a981', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/new-york-air-quality-alerts', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': ' Tens of millions under air quality alerts in US as Canada fire smoke drifts south', 'lead': 'Eastern US states including New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut issue alerts as hundreds of wildfires burn in Canada', 'author': 'Adam Gabbatt in New York', 'datePublished': '2023-06-08 01:57:33', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562571', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/11649ffc8f8dcdb7451de324e538b06f07a991d4/0_0_4538_2723/500.jpg', 'body': 'Tens of millions of people in the US were under air quality alerts on Wednesday, as smoke from Canadian wildfires drifted south, turning the sky in some of the country’s biggest cities a murky brown and saturating the air with harmful pollution. States across the east, including New York, Massachusetts and Connecticut, issued air quality alerts, with officials recommending that people limit outdoor activity. In New York City, where conditions were expected to deteriorate further through the day, residents were urged to limit their time outdoors, as public schools canceled outdoor activities. Smoke from wildfires in Canada has been moving south into the US since May. Hundreds of fires are burning in Canada, from the western provinces to Nova Scotia and Quebec in the east, where there are more than 150 active fires in a particularly fierce start to the summer season. New York City had the worst air quality of any big city in the world on Wednesday, according to IQAir. Second worst was Lahore, Pakistan, while the next worst major US city, Detroit, Michigan, came in at 13th. Delhi, India, which consistently ranks among the worst cities for air pollution, was sixth worst. The smell of smoke was detectable in New York on Tuesday evening as the sky turned orange-brown and visibility shrank before sunset. The smell persisted on Wednesday, and an air quality advisory was expected to remain in place until Wednesday night in much of central and eastern New York state. In New York City, schools canceled all outdoor events and residents were encouraged to wear face masks, which many had shed as the coronavirus pandemic waned. “We recommend all New Yorkers limit outdoor activity to the greatest extent possible,” the mayor, Eric Adams, said. “Those with pre-existing respiratory problems, like heart or breathing problems, as well as children and older adults, may be especially sensitive and should stay indoors at this time.” Adams said air conditions were expected to deteriorate throughout Wednesday afternoon and evening. Almost the entire state of New Jersey was under an air quality alert, while hazy conditions and smoke from the wildfires were reported across the Great Lakes region from Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, New York. The smoke had drifted as far south as South Carolina, where officials recommended that people keep doors and windows closed. In Philadelphia, the smell of smoke prompted a spate of 911 calls on Tuesday night, 6ABC reported, as residents were asked to avoid going outdoors as much as possible. Air-quality alerts are triggered by a number of factors, including the detection of fine-particle pollution – known as “PM 2.5” – which can irritate the lungs. “We have defenses in our upper airway to trap larger particles and prevent them from getting down into the lungs. These are sort of the right size to get past those defenses,” Dr David Hill, a pulmonologist in Waterbury, Connecticut, and a member of the American Lung Association’s national board of directors, told the Associated Press. “When those particles get down into the respiratory space, they cause the body to have an inflammatory reaction to them.” The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said hazy skies, reduced visibility and the odor of burning wood are likely, and that the smoke will linger for a few days in northern states. “It’s not unusual for us to get fire smoke in our area. It’s very typical in terms of north-west Canada,” Darren Austin, a meteorologist and senior air quality specialist with the Rhode Island department of environmental management, told the AP. But, usually, the smoke has been aloft and hasn’t affected people’s health, Austin said. Experts, and some political leaders were highlighting links between the wildfires and the climate crisis. A 2021 study supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association found that climate change has been the main driver of the increase in hot, dry fire weather in the western US. By 2090, global wildfires are expected to increase in intensity by up to 57% thanks to climate change, a United Nations report warned last year.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a982', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/un-climate-talks-might-avoid-fossil-fuel-phase-out-says-cop28-official', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Countries have not yet agreed to put fossil fuel phase-out on Cop28 agenda', 'lead': 'Director-general of climate talks, Majid Al Suwaidi, says governments have not reached agreement to discuss key issue', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey in Bonn', 'datePublished': '2023-06-07 16:22:32', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562589', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/1acc4c474f2b7008d5f4f4b0306a2098f4d9b547/0_183_5500_3300/500.jpg', 'body': 'UN climate talks this year might skirt the vital question of whether and how to phase out fossil fuels, as nations have not yet agreed to discuss the issue, one of the top officials hosting the talks has said. Majid Al Suwaidi, director-general of the Cop28 climate talks for its host nation, the United Arab Emirates, said governments were not in agreement over whether the phaseout of fossil fuels should be on the agenda for the conference, which begins in November. “Remember, there are two sides of this discussion. There are many on one side of the discussion who would like to see the kind of language of phasing out fossil fuels,” he said. “But there are others in other different circumstances in different situations, who have different views on how that language should be formulated. And I think that that’s what the process is about – bringing everybody together with differing views and finding that common ground that works for everyone.” Al Suwaidi has attended many conferences of the party (Cop) meetings under the UN framework convention on climate change. The UAE has come under fire for its choice of Sultan Al Jaber, the head of the country’s national oil company, Adnoc, as president of Cop28. Adnoc is planning major increases in its oil and gas production capacity. On Thursday, civil society groups in Bonn will protest against “conflicts of interest” over Al Jaber’s dual role in the negotiations. A preparatory session for Cop28, is being held this week in Bonn. Al Suwaidi said fossil fuels would form a key part of the discussions at Cop28, but whether a phaseout would be discussed as part of the official agenda of the talks was still up for grabs. “Our presidency is here for whatever the parties’ consensus is. The parties’ consensus is to have a discussion around fossil fuels. And we will support having a discussion around fossil fuels. It’s really up to the parties decide what they want to have on the agenda as part of this process,” he told the Guardian. “That’s what we as a presidency are focused on: finding the solutions that will allow everyone to go away feeling that they made significant progress and feel that it was worth the discussion.” But he added that there would still be a role for fossil fuels, even if the world targeted net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which scientists say is necessary to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its latest comprehensive report on climate science, noted that there could be a small role for oil and gas, if used alongside technologies to remove carbon dioxide, even in 2050, when the world must reach net zero. Al Suwaidi said: “We know that that the energy mix that is going to achieve net zero is, if we’re serious about this conversation, going to include fossil fuels in some form. So I think that the discussion has to be about what is the proper mix, what is the proper language that allows us to achieve the emissions reductions that we need to achieve while allowing different pathways for different countries to achieve the net zero target.” But several prominent climate scientists, including IPCC authors, told the Guardian they were concerned about the IPCC findings being taken in this way. Although there could be a small amount of fossil fuel used while achieving this net zero, this should be minimal and not taken as a licence for fossil fuel producers to continue their operations, the scientists warned. Al Jaber, who will attend the Bonn talks on Thursday, met the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and several top EU officials on Wednesday. In a statement emerging from that meeting, they did not mention the phaseout of fossil fuels, but referred instead to pursuing “energy systems free of unabated fossil fuels”. The word unabated usually refers to the use of technology to capture and store carbon dioxide (CCS). Al Suwaidi also defended the use of CCS, which he said could be used to help avoid breaching the 1.5C limit. “We can’t be exclusive [of CCS],” he said. “We need every solution on the table, every solution that works for different people is a good solution. There’s no silver bullet here.” Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, warned against over-reliance on CCS, in an interview with the Guardian at Bonn. He said it was “no free lunch” and that it would be expensive and difficult to implement, meaning there was a danger the world would continue to heat and overstep planetary boundaries, known as tipping points, that could trigger severe impacts from the climate crisis.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a983', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/insect-decline-a-threat-to-fruit-crops-and-food-security-scientists-warn-mps-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Insect decline a threat to fruit crops and food security, scientists warn MPs', 'lead': 'Poor pollination caused by destructive farming methods leads to loss of biodiversity and is a threat to food production, inquiry told', 'author': 'Phoebe Weston', 'datePublished': '2023-06-07 14:45:27', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562607', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/ff3e5126d6fec2fbba40259b2fa02e8d8aee54cc/0_370_4394_2635/500.jpg', 'body': 'Fruit growers in the UK are already seeing less yield and lower-quality produce because of the loss of insects, scientists have told MPs, warning that a further loss of pollinators could have “significant” impacts on all crops. As part of a parliamentary inquiry into insect decline and UK food security, Prof Simon Potts from the University of Reading told MPs at the science, innovation and technology committee that there is already good evidence of a shortfall of pollinators and a threat to food production. He said: “That shortfall translates not only into less yield but also lower-quality produce … With poor pollination, you’re getting a shortfall in the production of nutrients, and for the farmers of course that translates into loss of profit.” Focusing on interpreting insect-decline data, Potts’ contribution referenced a study that shows a deficit in pollination for the UK’s gala apples could equate to £5.7m in loss of production. This, he said, could be fixed with interventions to boost pollinators. The study notes that bees and hoverflies are the main pollinators of apples, and are “essential” for global production of apples, one of the world’s most important fruit crops. The study says “direct links between insect pollination and apple quality are equivocal”, with specific mention of the number of seeds, size (which affects their marketability) and calcium levels. Potts said there was minimal data on pollinator trends in the countries from where the UK imports many of its fruits and vegetables. “We’ve got a challenge at home, absolutely ... but we have almost no data on the status and trends of pollinators and other beneficial insects in those countries that produce a huge amount of fruit and veg that comes to the UK. That, in terms of policy and practice, is a huge challenge.” He added: “Many of our crops – mangoes, raspberries, strawberries – are coming in from north Africa, Europe or South America. We are quite vulnerable, not only at home but also overseas.” Insect pollination contributes more than £600m to the UK economy every year. More than 75% of all food crops require pollination, and declines have serious implications for global food security. The drivers of insect loss vary, but almost certainly include loss of habitat (driven by the expansion of agricultural land), exposure to pesticides and climate breakdown. Research published this week revealed that conservation measures over the past 30 years have failed to stop the decline of insects on British farmland. Potts encouraged MPs to push for a new biodiverse and sustainable farming system, which he said could be be done through farming policy by way of environment land management schemes, as well as local nature recovery strategies and biodiversity net gain (BNG), both of which could include policies around insects. Prof Dave Goulson from the University of Sussex, who was giving evidence alongside Potts, said: “Insects are quite adaptable, and they’ve been around for 480m years and survived all the mass extinction events that have gone before. But, simultaneously, if their home is destroyed, there’s nowhere to nest, they can’t find anything to eat … When you put it all together, then we shouldn’t really be surprised that they’re struggling to cope.” He reiterated the need to improve the way we farm. “Seventy per cent of Britain, roughly, is farmland, and there is pretty clear evidence that the way farming has changed is the biggest driver of biodiversity declines.

The Bay Area locals – Jen Maiser, Jessica Prentice, Sage Van Wing and Dede Sampson – invited the audience to join them in a local food challenge: spending the next month eating only food produced within 100 miles (160km) of their homes. Although the concept of eating locally was not new – the farm-to-table movement had kicked off in the 1960s and 70s as hippies protested against processed foods and Alice Waters opened the first farm-to-table restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California – these women gave it new life with a new name, calling themselves “locavores”. In his 2006 book, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, Bay Area local Michael Pollan also advocated for the local food movement, and by 2007 the Oxford American Dictionary had dubbed “locavore” its word of the year. Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that eating local food is better for the environment. But in recent years, a series of studies have shown that eating locally might not be as environmentally impactful – in and of itself – as advocates once hoped. In fact, research shows that the carbon footprint of transporting food is relatively small, and that it’s more important to focus on how your food is produced. Eating local can be a part of that, but it doesn’t have to be. What’s the evidence for eating local? In 1994, the UK-based Sustainable Agriculture Food and Environment Alliance (now called Sustain) published The Food Miles Report – the Dangers of Long-Distance Food Transport, which offered scientific backing for the burgeoning local food movement. It argued that the long-distance transportation of food was only possible because of cheap, non-renewable fossil fuels that allowed transnational corporations to “exploit land, labour and resources in developing countries for the production of raw commodities to which they add considerable mark-ups before sale in the North”. “As you can perceive in the title, food miles were initially considered (almost by definition) as a big threat and contributor to climate change,” Laura Enthoven, a PhD researcher in agricultural economics at the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium and author of a recent review of local food systems research, said in an email. The farther food had to travel, the more fossil fuel was used and greenhouse gases emitted. Those emissions are especially high for food transported by airplane: food that is flown is responsible for up to 50 times as much carbon dioxide as food transported by boat. Fortunately, very little food travels by air (think perishables that need to be eaten soon after harvest, like asparagus and berries). Many fruits and vegetables with a longer shelf life, like apples and broccoli, can be shipped by boat, truck or rail, whose food miles produce far fewer emissions. Is it the best way to reduce food-related emissions? In the 2000s, scientists began conducting full life cycle assessments of food supply chains – looking at how much greenhouse gases are emitted not just when food is transported, but also when crops are planted and fertilized, animals are taken out to pasture or kept in confinement, and food scraps end up in the garbage. What they found was that transporting food made up a relatively small percentage of food’s total carbon footprint. In a 2018 paper, a team of researchers from the UK and Switzerland found that only 1% to 9% of food’s emissions come from packaging, transport and retail. The vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions – 61% – come during production, while food is still on the farm. That’s supported by research published in the early 2000s in the US and Europe. “What we eat and how it is produced makes more impact on our food carbon footprint than purely where it comes from in terms of distance,” said Enthoven. The greatest source of emissions can vary among foods. In many crops, it’s the fertilizer and pesticides required to grow large quantities of food on industrial farms. In beef, for example, less than 1% of emissions come from transportation while the vast majority come just from feeding cattle (and their methane-heavy burps). Scientists are still grappling with how to define food miles: some only take into account the emissions of transporting food while others consider the full life cycle of producing food in one region before it is moved to another. As recently as last year, a study in Nature Food found that food miles accounted for a significantly larger share of the food system’s emissions than had been previously thought by taking into account the emissions from transporting fertilizers, machinery and animal feed to grow that food. So is eating local worth it? Does the research mean there are no benefits to eating locally? “It depends,” both Enthoven and Mike Hamm, a professor emeritus and founding director of the Michigan State University Center for Regional Food Systems, said separately. Eating locally can be a means of supporting farms that use more environmentally friendly production practices, such as minimizing their use of fossil fuel-rich pesticides and fertilizers. “I’ve often said the whole idea of local foods wasn’t about just reducing food miles,” said John Ikerd, professor emeritus of agricultural economics at the University of Missouri. It’s also a solution for people “looking for an alternative to the industrial food system”. Ikerd recalls the farm-to-table movement and hippy-led rebellion against industrial food beginning shortly after Rachel Carson’s indictment of pesticides, Silent Spring, was published in 1962. That led to the birth of the organic food movement, which sought to produce food without greenhouse gas-emitting fertilizers, pesticides and other chemicals. But as more corporations began producing organic-labeled food, Ikerd saw consumers turn to local farms where they might have a better sense of how their food was grown – and more peace of mind that farmers were using regenerative agricultural practices. “Well-designed, inclusive, local food initiatives can have a positive impact,” said Enthoven. But she cautions that consumers can fall into a “local trap”, a term coined in a 2007 article by researchers at the University of Washington, if they “believe that the whole system should switch to local only, which is not per se more sustainable or inclusive”. Although many local farms tout themselves as ethical alternatives to industrial agriculture, there’s no rule saying they have to be organic or worker-friendly. In fact, many small farms are exempt from paying the federal minimum wage and US Occupational Safety and Health Administration safety oversight and investigations. Local farms can be important alternatives, especially when there are disruptions in supply chains, as occurred at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. But “we need a diversity of scale in our production system across product types,” said Hamm, especially as we look at ways to feed 8 billion people in the era of climate crisis.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a985', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/uae-oil-firm-cop28-climate-summit-emails-sultan-al-jaber-adnoc', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Absolute scandal’: UAE state oil firm able to read Cop28 climate summit emails', 'lead': '<strong>Exclusive:</strong> UN conference president Sultan Al Jaber is also head of oil firm, which was consulted on how to respond to a media inquiry', 'author': 'Damian Carrington Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-07 12:00:36', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562645', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/f1501910e16cb6ae9b95e60b6bbbfebb01ee2cba/0_193_5776_3466/500.jpg', 'body': 'The United Arab Emirates’ state oil company has been able to read emails to and from the Cop28 climate summit office and was consulted on how to respond to a media inquiry, the Guardian can reveal. The UAE is hosting the UN climate summit in November and the president of Cop28 is Sultan Al Jaber, who is also chief executive of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc). The revelations have been called “explosive” and a “scandal” by lawmakers. The Cop28 office had claimed its email system was “standalone” and “separate” from that of Adnoc. But expert technical analysis showed the office shared email servers with Adnoc. After the Guardian’s inquiries, the Cop28 office switched to a different server on Monday. Al Jaber’s dual role has attracted strong criticism, including from the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, who called his approach “dangerous”. Replies to a Guardian email to the Cop28 office requesting reaction to these comments, which did not mention Adnoc, contained the text “Adnoc classification: internal”. The French MEP Manon Aubry, said: “This is an absolute scandal. An oil and gas company has found its way to the core of the organisation in charge of coordinating the phasing out of oil and gas. It is like having a tobacco multinational overseeing the internal work of the World Health Organization.” Aubry, who co-led a recent letter to the UN from 133 US and EU politicians calling for the removal of Al Jaber, said: “The Cop28 office has lost all credibility. If we care more about preventing a climate disaster than protecting the profits and influence of fossil fuel companies, we need to react now.” Pascoe Sabido, at Corporate Europe Observatory and co-coordinator of the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition of more than 450 organisations, said the revelations were outrageous and that Al Jaber’s appointment had been “a huge blow to the credibility” of the UN’s climate body, the UNFCCC. “It’s completely inappropriate that an oil corporation was consulted and it exposes just how influential it has been in shaping what gets presented to the outside world,” Sabido said. “Until world governments accept that fossil fuels need to be left in the ground and their lobbyists are no longer allowed to write the rules of climate action, this will keep happening.” A senior international climate policy expert, who requested anonymity, said: “The UAE have been advised by many actors since it became clear they would host Cop28 that they should separate out the presidency from Adnoc. They also were advised that Sultan Al Jaber should step down from his roles at Adnoc, even if temporarily. Despite a six-month listening tour, they do not seem to have picked up on this advice.” The Guardian revealed in April that the UAE had the third biggest net zero-busting plans for oil and gas expansion in the world. The International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a large consensus of scientists are clear that new oil and gasfields are incompatible with the 1.5C target of the Paris agreement. In addition to being the head of Adnoc, Al Jaber chairs Masdar, a renewable energy company, and was the UAE climate envoy from 2010 to 2016 – he was reappointed to the post in 2020. He received support from senior figures shortly after his appointment as Cop28 president in January, including from the US climate envoy John Kerry and EU climate chief Frans Timmermans. The Guardian discovered the links between the UAE’s Cop28 office and Adnoc after requesting a response to Figueres’s criticisms in mid-May. When asked why the email replies contained the text “Adnoc classification: internal”, the Cop28 office said it had “sought input from several subject matter experts regarding emissions, including Adnoc” and that the internal classification mark had become part of the email chain as a result. The Guardian also asked if the Cop28 office shared an IT system with Adnoc. Politico reported in January that the UNFCCC had sent a “series of questions inquiring whether the presidency will be independent of the oil company … including whether there is a firewall between the two institutions; whether Adnoc has access to Cop28 meetings and strategic documents; if [Cop28] staff are relying on the oil giant’s IT systems”. The Cop28 office replied to the Guardian on 23 May, with a spokesperson stating: “Cop28 can confirm that Cop28 content (including emails) are held in separate servers, housed in the Cop28 offices, on a standalone, firewall-protected network, supported by a separate Cop28 IT team.” However, expert technical analysis for the Guardian of the headers of emails from the Cop28 office and from an earlier email chain between the Guardian and the oil company revealed that Adnoc servers were involved in both sending and receiving emails from the Cop28 office. “The [Cop28] server handed everything off to the oil company’s server to send the email out,” said Dr Richard Clayton, at the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, UK, and an expert in traceability. “The oil company was able to look at all of the email which they were sending out.” Prof Alan Woodward, a computer security expert at the University of Surrey, UK, added: “Both the [Cop28] and Adnoc emails use the same primary email external service. Their MX record – where their email is sent to – was the same Proofpoint server.” In response to the finding that Adnoc servers were involved in Cop28 office communications, the Cop28 spokesperson said on 2 June: “For the past few months, Cop28 has been using a dedicated Microsoft 365 tenant and email service. We have been migrating our data from the previous host to our own setup and we expect that this process will be complete by 5 June.” The MEP Bas Eickhout, the vice-chair of the EU parliament’s environment committee, said the Guardian’s findings were “explosive”. He added: “The [UAE presidency of Cop28] is a merger of the economic interests of a fossil country with a fundamental transition agenda that should be away from this fossil industry – that will not go well, and [these revelations] already show that it’s not going well.” Al Jaber should be replaced as Cop28 president, Eickhout said. But with time running short before the November summit, he said the UNFCCC secretariat “should now take more control of the entire process” and better reflect the statements made by the UN secretary general António Guterres, who has warned that the climate crisis has put the world on a “highway to hell”. The UNFCCC did not respond to a request for comment. Al Jaber has previously defended his appointment, and told the Guardian in April that his business ties would prove an asset in ensuring the private sector took the necessary action on the climate crisis. The US senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who also co-led the letter calling for the removal of Al Jaber, said: “The [Guardian] reports seem to confirm what many of us have been saying. Sultan Al Jaber will be hard-pressed to separate his role as CEO of Adnoc from his role as the head of the world’s largest diplomatic gathering on climate change. Our window to avert climate disaster is narrowing, and there’s too much at stake for the planet to get this wrong.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a986', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/scottish-firm-expands-oil-and-gas-business-after-green-transition-loan', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'UK firm given £430m green transition loan then expanded oil and gas business', 'lead': 'Exclusive: Wood Group boosts fossil fuel business and shrinks renewables work after getting government-backed loan', 'author': 'Wil Crisp', 'datePublished': '2023-06-07 10:28:06', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562663', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d63a2f50c56adfac9536ef7fce30dd32b3d99cc4/0_63_2464_1479/500.jpg', 'body': 'The international engineering company Wood Group has expanded its oil and gas business and dramatically shrunk its renewables operations after receiving a £430m government-backed “green transition loan”, prompting calls from environmental groups for a review of the process that authorised the loan. The growth of fossil fuels business of the company, with headquarters in Aberdeen, Scotland, has shown that the government’s “transition export development guarantee” scheme, which guaranteed the loan, facilitates greenwashing and is open to abuse by polluting companies, according to environmental groups. After receiving the £430m loan, Wood grew its upstream oil and gas business by 17% so that it accounted for more than $3bn (£2.4bn) in revenue in 2022, up from $2.6bn in 2021, according to an analysis of the company’s financial results by the Guardian and the investigative journalism organisation Point Source. Over the same period the company reduced the size of its renewable, hydrogen, and carbon capture business units by 35% so that they only accounted for revenues of $222.8m in 2022, down from $344.6m in 2021. The five-year loan, which was the first of its kind and was designed to help Wood transition away from fossil fuels, was announced in August 2021 by Liz Truss when she was international trade secretary. At the time, Truss said the engineering company had “already made great strides in repositioning its business for a low-carbon future”. After being awarded the loan, Wood announced a string of at least 20 major contract awards for work on oil, gas and petrochemical infrastructure. These include a multimillion-dollar contract with Saudi Aramco to deliver engineering and project management services for Saudi Arabia’s Safaniyah and Manifa oilfields, which Wood announced on 7 December 2021. Wood said the two-year contract included the delivery of conceptual studies, engineering work and project management services for pipelines and infrastructure and would help to “maximise production capacity” of the oilfields. Less than three months after being awarded the loan, Wood also announced that it had been awarded a new three-year contract by Shell to help extend the production life of oil and gas facilities in the North Sea. On top of this, it announced significant contracts with the international oil and gas companies Chevron, BP and Equinor. Robin Wells, a spokesperson from Fossil Free London, said: “This demonstrates that, in at least one case, the government’s transition export development guarantee scheme has facilitated greenwashing. “It should not be possible for a company to receive a green transition loan and then double down on the expansion of its fossil fuels business.” Lucie Pinson, the director of the campaign group Reclaim Finance, said: “It is quite outrageous that the government is financially supporting Wood when the company is making hundreds of millions of dollars from oil deals and, at the same time, we are in the middle of a cost of living crisis where people are struggling to heat their homes.” Less than a year after receiving the loan, Wood announced the sale of an environmental consulting unit to Canada’s WSP Global for $1.8bn. According to Wood, the business unit it sold employed 6,000 people and was responsible for “consulting and engineering solutions that address environmental risks, increase climate resilience, help to build more sustainable infrastructure”. After the sale was completed, the Aberdeen-based company said it intended to focus on a new strategy built around core business units, which included oil and gas. As part of the strategy, Wood reduced the volume of engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) work that it took on in the renewable energy sector. In an investor statement released by the company in late March this year, Wood commented on an increasing share of the company’s “pipeline of opportunities” coming from a small number of sectors, including oil and gas, saying: “The difference mainly relates to the removal of EPC opportunities across renewables, in line with our new risk appetite and strategy.” Maaike Beenes, a spokesperson for the environmental campaign group BankTrack, said: “The decisions that led up to this loan being issued should be reviewed and UK Export Finance should raise its standards so that this kind of mistake isn’t made again in the future. “This loan has clearly failed to move Wood in the right direction – and the fact that it was designed so poorly shows a lot of naivety on the part of the government.” The loan was guaranteed by the government’s credit agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), which said, in August 2021, that Wood had committed to “increasing its clean growth portfolio and significantly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions over the five-year tenure of the facility”. According to UKEF, in order to be eligible for a transition export development guarantee, a company must demonstrate that it is “actively transitioning away from fossil fuels” and, if the company does not hit specific environmental targets, it will be required to pay a higher interest rate on the loan. Crisil, a subsidiary of the US financial information company S&amp;P Global, acted as an independent consultant to assess the credibility of Wood’s clean growth plan and carbon reduction targets. Wood, Crisil, and UKEF all declined to say what the targets were, how they were measured, or whether Wood was on course to hit them. In a statement, Wood said it “remains committed to playing a critical role in the energy transition, in the short, medium and long term”. It added: “A significant part of our role is also supporting our oil and gas and wider industry clients to decarbonise their operations. The KPI measures of the loan centre on reducing our own scope one and two emissions and growing our sustainable revenues. We are pleased that we achieved a 65% reduction in our scope one and two emissions. “Wood’s business was repositioned following the sale of the Built Environment business in 2022 and following this change, we paid down two-thirds of the bank loan value. This change was a contributing factor to the reduction in our sustainable revenues in 2022. However, we have stated that we anticipate significant growth in sustainable revenues from sectors such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage through to 2025 and beyond.” Crisil said it was commissioned to review the feasibility of Wood’s climate transition plan, but was not involved in monitoring how the money was spent or progress on meeting environmental targets. It added: “The review process was conducted in accordance with our bespoke research approach, using publicly available data and management information.” A UKEF spokesperson said: “We are firmly committed to supporting the UK’s transition towards a low-carbon economy as part of our 2050 net zero target. Our transition export development guarantee requires firms to report progress against a climate transition plan to deliver their commitments.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a987', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/pfas-3m-dupont-chemical-industry-health-toxic-study', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Chemical industry used big tobacco’s tactics to conceal evidence of PFAS risks', 'lead': 'DuPont or 3M scientists discovered PFAS toxicity internally, but did not publish findings or report them to the EPA, study says', 'author': 'Tom Perkins', 'datePublished': '2023-06-07 10:00:35', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562683', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/cf580be069882377b4d1e600c381b4933733e88e/0_131_2048_1229/500.jpg', 'body': 'In 1953, a paper developed for cigarette maker RJ Reynolds detailed possible cancer-causing agents in tobacco, but the document would remain hidden from public view for decades. In the interim, the industry told the public: “We don’t accept the idea that there are harmful agents in tobacco.” The chemical industry, it seemed, took note. Just a few years later, DuPont scientists found PFAS enlarged lab rats’ livers and likely caused birth defects in workers. Still, the company told its employees the cancer-linked compounds are “about as toxic as table salt”. Like the tobacco industry before it, the chemical industry managed to keep PFAS’s health risks hidden from the public for decades. A new peer-reviewed study dissecting PFAS producers’ public relations strategies provides a smoking gun timeline composed of industry studies and comments from DuPont and 3M officials showing they knew the dangers, but publicly insisted the chemicals were safe. “The chemical industry used the tactics of the tobacco industry to delay public awareness of the toxicity of PFAS and, in turn, delayed regulations governing their use,” the University of California at San Francisco authors wrote. “PFAS are now ubiquitous in the population and environment.” PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make thousands of products resistant to water, stains and heat. The compounds are linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called “forever chemicals” because of their longevity in the environment. The public largely would not learn of the health threat until the aughts when subpoenaed records in a lawsuit against DuPont revealed the chemicals’ toxicity and industry cover up. The study used scientific methodology previously developed by tobacco industry researcher Stan Glantz to analyze similar documents from cigarette makers. The authors found PFAS producers and their allies most frequently employed two tobacco strategies: withholding internal studies that revealed health risks and distorting public discourse. “All these companies … try to prevent the development of public understanding and they’re always years ahead of the public and mainstream scientific community,” Glantz said. Between 1961 and 2006, the authors identified dozens of instances where DuPont or 3M scientists discovered or acknowledged PFAS toxicity internally, but did not publish the findings or report them to the EPA, as required under federal law. DuPont’s chief toxicologist in 1961 found rats’ livers enlarged at very low doses of exposure, a health impact recognized as “the most sensitive sign of toxicity.” The report recommended PFAS be handled “with extreme care” and that “contact with the skin should be strictly avoided.” Around the same time, a DuPont worker died from PFAS inhalation, which the company on multiple occasions dismissed as a rumor. Meanwhile, workers reported an “epidemic” of flu-like symptoms from Teflon exposure. In 1970, a DuPont-funded lab found PFAS to be “highly toxic when inhaled and moderately toxic when ingested”. About a decade later, the lab killed two dogs with low doses of the chemicals. The lab also observed corneal ulcerations in newborns, and 3M, in a report shared with DuPont, “observed fetus eye changes were due to [PFAS]”. In the early 1980s, DuPont found elevated liver enzymes in 60% of workers tested, and a confidential internal report detailed birth defects among pregnant plant employees. In the years that followed, 3M and DuPont internal studies found the chemicals likely caused prostate, testicular, bladder and kidney cancers. Virtually none of this information was shared with the public, regulators, or DuPont employees, and none of the research was published in a scientific journal. The motivation, said study co-author Tracey Woodruff, was profits. “This is a chemical that made them a lot of money, and these studies that showed the chemicals are harmful would be threatening their profits if [the studies] came out,” she added. Instead, in a 1980 memo circulated to employees, DuPont insisted “there is no known evidence that our employees have been exposed to [PFAS] levels that pose adverse health effects.” “We know of no evidence of birth defects caused by [PFAS] at DuPont,” the document continued, adding that the chemicals are “about as toxic as table salt”. When water pollution near its Parkersburg, West Virginia, plant seemed to be sickening residents, DuPont responded in a press release that DuPont and 3M have found “no known toxic or ill health effects in humans at concentration levels detected”. As media and public scrutiny of the chemicals’ dangers increased in the 2000s, DuPont vice-president Susan Stalnecker wrote an email to the EPA in 2006 with the subject line “Urgent: EPA Action Needed”. “We need the EPA to quickly (like first thing tomorrow) say the following: 1. That ‘Consumer products sold under the Teflon brand are safe’ and 2. ‘Further, to date, there are no human health effects known to be caused by PFOA,’” the email read. That same year, 3M funded a study that found no liver effects in men exposed to PFAS. PFAS manufacturers have continued to conceal evidence since the conclusion of the DuPont lawsuit. The Guardian in 2021 revealed how DuPont and Japanese chemical maker Daikin hid evidence of the toxicity of 6:2 FTOH, a “new generation” of an allegedly safe PFAS compound that was approved for use in food packaging in 2009. But the companies’ testing before and after approval showed the chemicals caused kidney failure, liver damage, mammary gland problems, mottled teeth and other issues in lab rats. It’s unclear how the industry hides today, but “their history makes me think that there’s always something that they aren’t disclosing”, said Maricel Maffini, an independent consultant who blew the whistle on 6:2 FTOH. She said the problem is due in part to the nation’s weak regulatory system, which in the case of the Food and Drug Administration does not require chemical companies to alert the agency if it finds a chemical is more dangerous than was known at the time it was approved. Governments have begun taking only the most basic steps to protect the public from PFAS, and the federal government has yet to set any enforceable rules. The most meaningful legislation has come at the state level over the last two years, where a crop of laws now prohibit PFAS in consumer goods such as clothing, food packaging, firefighting foam and cosmetics. The delay was a direct result of the PFAS industry’s campaign, Woodruff said. Had the internal documents been released sooner, the EPA may have acted differently and independent scientists would have been studying the chemicals. That would have generated the kind of public pressure that is only now forcing governments to respond. “This all would have occurred a lot earlier,” Woodruff added.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a989', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/07/country-diary-a-stone-curlew-glides-into-view-like-a-mad-little-yacht', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: A stone curlew glides into view like a mad little yacht | Nicola Chester', 'lead': '<strong>Inkpen, Berkshire:</strong> This goggle-eyed rarity is full of surprises, and when it stands up, it reveals another', 'author': 'Nicola Chester', 'datePublished': '2023-06-07 04:30:27', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562721', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/08eb3a7747bc2167004f660f1e746f962166ffc4/0_47_1024_614/500.jpg', 'body': 'I am watching hares at rest in the growing wheat through my binoculars. One pulls its long, sundae-spoon ears through its paws to clean them. Another stretches like a dog, yawns and lies down, when something glides behind the harbour of its back like a yacht. There is no rise and fall in the movement of the body, with its short, cryptic, brown, black and white strokes. I blink and look away, refocus. There is a hare-like goggle-eye between wheat blades; a wild little sun with a small black planet dotted within. Pictures in field guides pop up like sleeping tabs in my brain: a stone-curlew. Two. Two stone-curlews. The first bird sails slowly back into view, the plimsoll line of a wing bar of white feathers aligned with the top of the young wheat. It stays straight as a spirit level as it cruises through the field. At a gap in the precision-drilled crop, it suddenly stands tall, and I realise that it has been travelling along in comedy subterfuge on bent knees, or hocks; these are the “thick knees” of its family name (Burhinus oedicnemus); it is not, in fact, a curlew. There is something else maritime about it; not just the smooth movement, or the white wing bar of fluttering bunting – its long yellow legs and its wader-short thick bill are in the same yachtsmen’s welly yellow. It makes me smile. The second bird stands too and the pair are together in a patch of sunlight, vivid against blue sky. I can see the way their crepuscular‑evolved eyes bulge and angle downwards, and how it matches the sad-clown-smile curve of their bill. They are mad and beautiful and clearly nesting, as the second bird settles back down and the first lowers the great hinges of his legs and stalks away. The vulnerability of these ground-nesting birds is brought home as a tractor appears in the field. I make a frantic run to flag it down. The farmer stops, dismounts from his cab and listens.

Populations of bees, spiders, ground beetles and hoverflies have disappeared twice as fast in areas intensely farmed for crops, according to the paper, which looked at citizen science data on more than 1,500 invertebrate species. Although there was a push to intensify agriculture after the second world war, since the early 90s more sustainable and wildlife-friendly farming practices have emerged, with EU agri-environment funding made available for farmers to plant hedgerows and wild flowers, alongside better regulation of pesticides. However, these have not managed to stem biodiversity loss. “In fact, for most of the taxonomic groups included in this study, declines appear to have accelerated over recent years,” the researchers write in the paper Invertebrate Biodiversity Continues to Decline in Cropland, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The study suggests that, despite having impact locally, wildlife-friendly farming measures have not been employed on a big enough scale to have an impact nationally. However, the scientists believe that post-Brexit changes to UK agricultural policy could help farming to achieve those goals. Lead researcher Francesca Mancini, from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: “The main message to policymakers is that despite the efforts we have put in in the last 30 years, this is just not enough. We really need to review what we’ve done and try to do better for the future for diversity, but also for the future of agriculture.” Insects are crucial to ecosystems because they provide food for other creatures, pollinate crops and recycle nutrients. The study compared areas in Britain with high and low cropland cover and found that declines are worse in areas with high cropland cover. The researchers divided Britain into 1 sq km cells that were categorised depending on how much cropland – predominantly oilseed rape and cereals such as barley – was being grown within them. They did not look at land used to graze animals. In areas with more than 50% cropland cover, invertebrate species had disappeared from 5% of sites that were occupied in 1990, while in areas with less than 50% cropland cover, they had disappeared from 2% of sites. Out of the six taxonomic groups examined, spiders and bees were the most negatively affected in areas with more than 50% cropland cover, showing a 7% and 4% decline respectively. Researchers suspect declines were worse before 1990, but lack sufficient data. “They are pretty sizeable declines,” said Mancini. “Because of the introduction of environment schemes and the improvement of policy and practice since the 1990s, we were hoping that we would find a slowing down or trends becoming stable. But that’s not the case, and things are still declining.” The paper suggested a number of possibilities, including the general intensification of agriculture, changes to the type and efficacy of insecticides, habitat loss around cropland, and the climate crisis and other weather-related events such as drought. In 2019, a global scientific analysis of insect decline concluded that agriculture was the main cause – in particular, the heavy use of pesticides. The mass of insects is falling by 2.5% a year, which means they could vanish within a century. The new findings mirror those of a study last month, which showed intensive agriculture was the greatest driver of bird declines in Europe, with the use of pesticides and fertilisers most to blame, according to the data collected by thousands of citizen scientists in 28 countries – including the UK – over nearly 40 years. “Sadly, insect declines are not surprising,” said Prof Jane Hill from the University of York, who is president of the Royal Entomological Society and was not involved in this research. “The findings help us to understand the patterns of insect declines, and so contribute to solving the puzzle of how to protect invertebrates and reverse declines.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a98b', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/carbon-capture-and-storage-is-no-free-lunch-warns-climate-chief-hoesung-lee', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Carbon capture and storage is ‘no free lunch’, warns climate chief', 'lead': 'IPPC chair Hoesung Lee says over-reliance on the technology could mean the world misses 1.5C target', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey in Bonn', 'datePublished': '2023-06-06 15:52:46', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562771', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/7bc491fbb697f5300049741f763f8d20aea3f8a5/0_0_5880_3528/500.jpg', 'body': 'Over-reliance on carbon capture and storage technology could lead the world to surpass climate tipping points, the head of the world’s climate science authority has warned. Hoesung Lee, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said using technologies that capture carbon dioxide or remove it from the atmosphere was “no free lunch” and that countries should be wary. Lee noted that the IPCC had found it was likely that global temperatures could rise by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels but could then be made to return to below 1.5C by the end of the century. “The jargon for that is the overshoot,” he said. “Carbon dioxide removal methods will be much in demand if that overshoot indeed occurs.” “But there will be a cost to doing that. There’s no free lunch. And that cost includes that the longer the period of overshoot, there will be additional global warming, and there will be consequences of increased warming. There is also the possibility of positive feedback from that additional warming, creating more losses and damages during the overshoot period,” he warned. “So one wishes to avoid such an overshoot scenario.” The IPCC warned in its latest comprehensive report on climate science, published in three parts from 2021 to 2022 with a fourth summary chapter delivered in March, that it was “now or never” to take action on emissions, if the world was to have a chance of avoiding the worst ravages of climate breakdown. Governments must make their own decisions on whether to use carbon capture and storage technology, Lee said, as the IPCC advised only on science, and was neutral on policy. “CCS technologies are all part of the solutions,” he told the Guardian in an interview, at in Bonn, where preparatory talks for the Cop28 UN climate summit are taking place this week and next. “The way to stay within the carbon budget is that [high-carbon] infrastructures should be equipped with some measures of emissions reductions. Our report very clearly indicates that unabated fossil fuels has to be changed, with some measures that can reduce carbon emissions.” Some representatives of fossil fuel interests have been arguing that the latest IPCC report justifies their continued production of oil and gas, citing a finding that a small amount of oil and gas production in 2050 was compatible with the need to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by that date. But one IPCC author told the Guardian that while the IPCC had found some oil and gas could still be produced in 2050, while sticking to the 1.5C limit, fossil fuel producers should not conclude from this that they could keep operating. “We need to reduce fossil fuels drastically,” the author said. Mark Maslin, professor of earth system science at University College London, said: “Just because there is an understanding that complete removal of fossil fuel use would be almost impossible in this century is no justification to expand production. When we are aiming of a global net zero emission world by 2050 – this means no new fossil production now, halving production over the next 10 years and reducing it as close to zero as possible by 2050. None of this in any way justifies countries expanding their fossil fuel production and to use the IPCC as an excuse is dishonest and a misuse of the science.” Prof Michael Mann, climatologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told the Guardian that oil producers were misrepresenting the IPCC’s findings if they argued for a continued use of fossil fuels. “The IPCC doesn’t weigh in what energy sources will or will not be needed decades from now. While low levels of carbon emissions could be offset with negative emissions technology by 2050, there is no room in such scenarios for substantive reliance on oil, gas, or coal decades from now if we are to achieve the necessary reductions.” Lee responded: “I have noticed that, in the past, various people cite the IPCC in a way that suits their needs, for unknown purposes. However, our report is a public document, produced by experts, and through numerous independent scientific reviews. Decision makers have their own independent judgements for their own policymaking. We provide the science.” Lee will step down as chair of the IPCC in late July, when a new chair will be chosen from four candidates, two of whom are women.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a98c', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/first-steps-agreed-on-plastics-treaty-after-breakthrough-at-paris-talks', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'First steps agreed on plastics treaty after breakthrough at Paris talks', 'lead': 'Delegates from 180 nations set out pathway to binding global agreement on tackling plastic pollution as soon as 2025', 'author': 'Emma Bryce', 'datePublished': '2023-06-06 15:07:47', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562789', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/249492fcf54c5f90909e9e213051dfd65dee4be5/0_0_2500_1500/500.jpg', 'body': 'Nation-state representatives have taken the first concrete step toward a legally binding treaty to regulate plastic, described as the most important green deal since the 2015 international climate agreement. The banging of a recycled-plastic gavel, on Friday night at Unesco headquarters in Paris, signalled the end of a fraught process, marked by accusations of exclusion and industrial lobbying. Talks threatened to fall apart, but in the end delegates were able to broadly agree on key elements that the treaty should contain, laying the groundwork for the future agreement. Attended by delegates from 180 nations and dozens of stakeholders including civil society groups, waste pickers and a coalition of scientists, the talks were the second of five meetings to thrash out the wording of the new treaty, which could come into force in 2025. The world produces almost 400m tonnes of plastic every year; an estimated 14m tonnes escape into the ocean annually. There is a growing recognition that this vast international problem requires a harmonised global response. While plastic has historically been viewed as an environmental waste problem, critics now emphasise the array of harms this fossil-fuel-derived and chemical-rich product causes to the environment and human health across its entire lifecycle. The production of plastic has been shown to worsen air pollution, while its material waste intensifies flooding and starves wildlife. Plastic particles are now found in the air, in drinking water and in human blood. Stakeholders used the talks to call for plans to manage microplastic pollution, regulate the thousands of hazardous chemicals baked into plastics, create a financial mechanism to support the transition, and protect the rights of people disproportionately exposed to plastic chemicals and waste, such as those in “Cancer Alley”, a region in the US state of Louisiana with a high concentration of petrochemical plants along the Mississippi. “We hear a lot about microplastics. But we get the impacts of plastic even smaller, as particulate matter,” says Jo Banner, co-founder of the nonprofit Descendants Project, which campaigns to support affected communities in Louisiana. Many countries called for action to go beyond cutting plastic pollution, to curb production as well. Pacific Islands delegates led those calls, due to the unique challenge plastic brings to states such as the Marshall Islands. These are too small to adequately manage and dispose of plastic waste, leaving mountainous waste dumps that have become the islands’ tallest peaks. “When things are moved across to the islands, who are the least suited to implement and enforce, the burden should not be placed on them,” said Sefanaia Nawadra, director general of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, an intergovernmental organisation representing the Pacific states. “That’s why we’re pushing for control on the upstream side.” The talks began with fierce disagreements about procedure, which many civil society groups and country delegates, including prominent voices from Mexico, claimed was a stalling tactic by oil- and plastic-producing nations, including Saudi Arabia and Brazil, together with fossil fuel and petrochemical lobbyists. However, a compromise postponed these procedural discussions to a later date, and observers to the closed-door negotiations said widespread agreement emerged on the potential core features of a future treaty. A majority of countries agreed that it should be global and legally binding, rather than voluntary. Meanwhile, the WWF said that 94 of the 180 nations in Paris had agreed that some especially harmful polymers, chemicals and plastic products – which might include intentionally added microplastics and PFAs (“forever chemicals”) – should be banned or phased out “We clearly have plastic-producer countries and industries very determined to throw wrenches in the works, and at the same time a growing ambition to address this problem at the root,” said Sirine Rached of the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. The draft document will be written in the coming months as a springboard for granular discussions of the final treaty text. “This mandate was hard fought for, but at least provides a clear direction of travel towards starting to draft the plastics treaty in earnest,” said Christina Dixon, ocean campaign leader at the Environmental Investigation Agency. Civil society and rights groups raised concerns about the lobbying influence of industry groups, including the American Chemistry Council and Plastics Europe. The French investigation newspaper Mediapart counted 190 industry representatives at the Paris talks, while many other organisations, including groups of Indigenous leaders and waste pickers, were told at short notice by the United Nations Environment Programme that there would be limited space at the event. Many are also concerned about the promotion of ideas such as chemical recycling. This is often used to transform plastics into fuel in a process that produces significant carbon emissions. The treaty has an unusually ambitious timescale for globally binding agreements, with the next round of talks in Kenya scheduled for this year, and the final agreement planned for late 2024. “It’s clear that most governments in the world want this and are ready to put in place global regulations on plastics,” said Eirik Lindebjerg, a policy manager at WWF. “It’s a massive opportunity to create an environmental agreement that will really make a positive difference to people’s lives.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a98d', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/too-late-now-to-save-arctic-summer-ice-climate-scientists-find', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Too late now to save Arctic summer ice, climate scientists find', 'lead': 'Ice-free summers inevitable even with sharp emissions cuts and likely to result in more extreme heatwaves and floods', 'author': 'Damian Carrington Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-06 15:00:13', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562807', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/9b78e432ea06b7b6e8707dedea814a48ad53b45c/0_121_3008_1804/500.jpg', 'body': 'It is now too late to save summer Arctic sea ice, research has shown, and scientists say preparations need to be made for the increased extreme weather across the northern hemisphere that is likely to occur as a result. Analysis shows that even if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced, the Arctic will be ice-free in September in coming decades. The study also shows that if emissions decline slowly or continue to rise, the first ice-free summer could be in the 2030s, a decade earlier than previous projections. The research shows that 90% of the melting is the result of human-caused global heating, with natural factors accounting for the rest. Since satellite records began in 1979, summer Arctic ice has shrunk by 13% a decade, in one of the clearest signs of the climate crisis. Arctic sea ice reaches its annual minimum at the end of summer, in September, and in 2021 it was at its second lowest extent on record. “Unfortunately it has become too late to save Arctic summer sea ice,” said Prof Dirk Notz, of the University of Hamburg, Germany, who was part of the study team. “As scientists, we’ve been warning about the loss of Arctic summer sea ice for decades. This is now the first major component of the Earth system that we are going to lose because of global warming. People didn’t listen to our warnings. “This brings another warning bell, that the kind of projections that we’ve made for other components of the Earth system will start unfolding in the decades to come.” Other climate scientists said in 2022 that the world was on the brink of multiple disastrous tipping points. Prof Seung-Ki Min, of Pohang University, South Korea, who led the new study, said: “The most important impact for human society will be the increase in weather extremes that we are experiencing now, such as heatwaves, wildfires and floods. We need to reduce CO2 emissions more ambitiously and also prepare to adapt to this faster Arctic warming and its impacts on human society and ecosystems.” In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that the Arctic would not lose its summer ice if emissions were cut sharply and global temperature rises were limited to 2C. But the new research, published in the journal Nature Communications, projects the loss of summer sea ice in the 2050s in the low emissions scenario. The IPCC report concluded that the Arctic would lose its summer ice in the 2040s in intermediate and high emissions scenarios, but the new research advances that by a decade into the 2030s. In the study, the scientists first established how much rising greenhouse gases have contributed to ice melting compared with natural factors such as variation in the sun’s intensity and emissions from volcanoes. “Humans really are to blame for almost all the loss of Arctic sea ice we have been observing,” Notz said. The scientists used this information to model future melting and found that the models underestimated the pace of melting compared with observations of ice in the Arctic from 1979 to 2019. Calibrating the models to be consistent with the observations led to the projections of faster melting and an ice-free summer even in the low emissions scenario. In the intermediate and high emissions scenarios, August and October also become ice-free by about 2080, the study found. It is not possible to pinpoint a particular year for the first ice-free summer because of natural variability in the climate system. Faster melting of Arctic sea ice leads to a vicious circle of more heating, because the dark ocean exposed as ice melts absorbs more heat from the sun. The result is faster warming in the Arctic, and scientists have increasing evidence that this is weakening the jet stream and leading to more extreme weather events in North America, Europe and Asia. The searing heatwave in the Pacific north-west of America in 2021 and the catastrophic floods in Pakistan in 2022 are the type of events that may be increasing in likelihood because of a weaker jet stream. Min said faster Arctic heating also accelerated the melting of the Greenland ice cap, driving up sea level, and the melting of permafrost regions, releasing more greenhouse gases. Polar bears and other wildlife in the Arctic and the Indigenous people of the region all rely on sea ice. Prof Mark Serreze, the director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder in the US, who was not part of the study team, said: “The key message is that we are pretty much destined to lose the Arctic’s sea ice cover in late summer. The question is: when will this occur? “Over the past decade, there has not been much of a downward trend in September sea ice, which reflects the natural variability in the system. This hiatus will not last, but it shows the difficulties in making predictions. About a decade ago, I mused that the Arctic might lose its summer sea ice by 2030. That may have been an overly aggressive statement. While from the present study 2030 is still in the running, I’m going with sometime in the 2040s – that’s still not very far away.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a98e', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/unesco-chief-praises-albanese-government-for-effort-to-protect-great-barrier-reef', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Unesco praises Albanese government for efforts to protect Great Barrier Reef', 'lead': 'Commitments to improve water quality and reduce stress from commercial fishing could mean the reef avoids going on world heritage danger list', 'author': 'Graham Readfearn', 'datePublished': '2023-06-06 15:00:13', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562828', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/7847bdc1c6a3de12dce0c3c1f3929a7785a303f0/0_0_2181_1309/500.jpg', 'body': 'The head of Unesco has praised the Albanese government for making new commitments to protect the Great Barrier Reef, signalling Australia could avoid seeing it being placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger.

Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the letter last week to Azoulay, seen by Guardian Australia, Plibersek asked for confirmation Australia had done enough to satisfy Unesco’s concerns, which included a recommendation last year from a monitoring mission that the reef should be placed on the “in-danger” list. Azoulay said there had been a year of dialogue between Australia and Unesco, with the country making commitments against 10 “high priority recommendations” delivered by the UN-backed monitoring mission. “The Great Barrier Reef is fragile jewel of world heritage,” Azoulay said. “For many years, Unesco has not ceased alerting the world to the risk of this site losing its universal value forever. “We have proposed several concrete measures which provide a roadmap for tackling the problem. I am delighted that the dialogue between our experts and the Australian authorities has now resulted in a set of formal commitments.” In the letter, Plibersek outlined the government’s commitments on improving water quality, fisheries reforms and “strong, legislated climate action” that aimed to address the concerns of Unesco’s experts. This week the Albanese government announced a $160m plan to phase out commercial gillnet fishing on the reef and to accelerate fisheries reforms in Queensland – one of the areas of concern. The world’s biggest reef system will be reviewed again by the world heritage committee at its next meeting in September, hosted by Saudi Arabia. Before that meeting Unesco is due to publish a “state of conservation” report on the reef that will recommend whether it should be placed on the in-danger list – a test of whether the Albanese government has done enough to satisfy Unesco. In November last year a report from a 10-day UN-backed monitoring mission to Queensland concluded the reef should be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger. But the report also listed 10 “high priority recommendations” and said their “rapid implementation” could “drastically improve” the reef’s fortunes and retain its unique features for future generations. The UN monitoring mission took place under the former Morrison government but its report was released after Anthony Albanese led Labor to power. One of those recommendations was for Australia’s cornerstone Reef 2050 plan to include “clear government commitments to reduce greenhouse emissions consistent with the efforts required to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.” Since then, the Albanese government has legislated a target to reduce emissions by 43% by 2030, based on 2005 levels. Analysts have said the target, while an improvement on the Morrison government’s, is not in line with keeping global temperatures to 1.5C. Unesco has long held concerns that targets to reduce pollution running into the reef’s waters from farming were not being met. In the letter to Azoulay, Plibersek writes that $1bn of investment to 2030 to cut pollution would put the reef “on a solid pathway” to “full ecosystem health” by 2050. A Unesco official said there had been an open exchange between Unesco, its experts and the Australian government since the mission report was published. Plibersek met Unesco officials in Paris last week, where it is understood she presented the government’s latest commitments to improve water quality and reduce the stress on the reef from unsustainable fishing, and outlined Australia’s new climate change targets. The UN mission came after the Morrison government furiously lobbied members of the world heritage committee in 2021 to ignore an official Unesco recommendation the reef be placed on the in-danger list. Climate change is seen as the greatest threat to the health of the reef. Widespread mass bleaching of corals on the reef – caused by rising ocean temperatures – was first seen in 1998, and happened again in 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a98f', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/climate-cardinals-ai-boost-artificial-intelligence', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘The change in pace is crazy’: AI boosts climate information translation drive', 'lead': 'Google-designed tools help 9,000 young Climate Cardinals volunteers who translate reports into more than 100 languages', 'author': 'Anna Turns', 'datePublished': '2023-06-06 12:00:07', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562846', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/6d96369fed528786fee85861cdd1e64be1385984/248_12_2494_1496/500.jpg', 'body': 'A network of young volunteers that translates climate information into dozens of languages is being boosted by new artificial intelligence tools designed by Google.

Volunteers have translated 500,000 words since 2020. They work with professional networks including Respond Crisis Translation and Translators Without Borders for editing and proofreading to ensure translations are credible and accurate. By trialling Google Cloud’s new AI-powered Translation Hub platform, Climate Cardinals has translated an additional 800,000 words into more than 40 languages. “It’s crazy. The change in pace was immediate – we’ve created the same volume of output in the first three months of this partnership that we had done in our first two years of operation,” said Kianni, who is studying science, technology and society at Stanford University in the heart of Silicon Valley. She said Climate Cardinals was developing its own online translation portal using the generative AI tool ChatGPT so people could easily translate their own resources. English is the main language of international scientific communication, with 80% of scientific papers written in the language. A 2016 study found that languages were still a “major barrier” to the global transfer of scientific knowledge. Just 18% of the world’s population speaks English as a native or second language. “Education is an empowerment tool,” said Kianni, who first learned about the climate crisis in sixth grade. When she found out that temperatures in the Middle East were rising at more than twice the global average rate, she began verbally translating climate information into Farsi to educate her Iranian relatives who had previously been unaware of the climate emergency. They now had pro-environmental attitudes, she said, and supported environmental defenders in Iran who had been persecuted for standing up against the government. “Those who are being worst impacted by the climate crisis deserve to have access to the resources they need to really make sense of the disasters impacting their communities, so that they can use their voices to create this larger chorus of people calling for action,” said Kianni, who has served as the youngest ever adviser to the UN secretary general’s youth advisory group on climate change. “Africa is on the frontlines of the climate crisis despite barely contributing to it. People who are being disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis tend to be people of colour, and 80% of climate refugees are women, so it is 100% a social justice issue.” “Obviously, we have not solved the problem of climate translation but through our partnership with Google, we’ve created a tangible pipeline for providing an amazing capacity of translations to almost all of our partners,” added Kianni. She said Climate Cardinals’ youth members were still collating, formatting and delivering the automated translations. “The next step is about empowerment and making people understand how they can be part of the solution.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a990', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/rishi-sunak-tories-air-pollution-ulez-expansion-scientists-letter', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Sunak urged to distance himself from Tories who dismiss air pollution risks', 'lead': 'Leading scientists write to PM amid campaign against expansion of clean air zone in London', 'author': 'Sandra Laville Environment correspondent', 'datePublished': '2023-06-06 05:00:01', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562864', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/a1b6c89a9cf65a11921070e36827cf9af052b84c/0_0_3500_2100/500.jpg', 'body': 'World-leading air pollution scientists have called on Rishi Sunak to distance himself from Conservative colleagues who are dismissing the facts on the serious health risks of toxic air. In a letter, Prof Frank Kelly and 35 other prominent air pollution scientists call on the prime minister to tell his colleagues not to endorse “merchants of doubt” who “undermine the factual and truth foundations of life.” Conservative MPs including Sunak and the former prime minister Boris Johnson have backed an increasingly high-profile campaign against the expansion of the ultra-low emission zone to all London boroughs in August. Some have questioned the need for the clean air zone to be expanded, saying there is no problem with air pollution in their areas. In the letter to Sunak, Kelly said the evidence-based facts on the contribution of poor air quality to asthma, strokes, heart attacks, cancer and dementia had been uncovered by UK scientists. But Conservatives have questioned and discredited those facts “in an attack on the very essence of our scientific community”. “A collapse in trust in the scientific process would be a disaster,” the open letter to Sunak said. “We urge you to disassociate from the merchants of doubt and, in no uncertain terms, to tell your party colleagues to not endorse them or emulate their pervasive clams that sow cynicism and undermine the factual and truth foundations of life.” The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, argues the city cannot afford to not stop people “breathing in poison”, with 4,000 premature deaths a year from toxic air in the capital. The Ulez will be expanded on 29 August to take in outer London boroughs. Its extension is being challenged in court by five Conservative councils: the boroughs of Bexley, Bromley, Harrow and Hillingdon, and Surrey. The rollout of the scheme comes with a £110m fund from Khan’s City Hall to help the poorest scrap older, polluting cars, which will attract a fee of £12.50 each day for travel in outer London. Kelly pointed out that the government had not provided any funding to subsidise the poorest to scrap their vehicles. UK scientists have led the field on exposing the dangers of toxic air pollution. In 2016, a joint report from the Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health estimated that the equivalent of 40,000 deaths was attributable to outdoor air pollution every year in the UK. In December 2020, after the inquest into the death of nine-year-old Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, air pollution exposure was listed as a cause of death for the first time in the UK. Philip Barlow, the inner south London coroner, said the schoolgirl was exposed to nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (PM) pollution in excess of World Health Organization guidelines, the principal source of which were traffic emissions. In his prevention of death report, the coroner warned more people would die of toxic air if no action was taken. “There was no dispute at the inquest that atmospheric air pollution is the cause of many thousand premature deaths every year in the UK. Delay in reducing the levels of atmospheric air pollution is the cause of avoidable deaths,” he said. Barlow said WHO guidance levels for particulate matter – PM pollution – should become the legal limits in the UK to reduce the number of air pollution deaths but warned there was no safe limit for particulate pollution. Despite the evidence of harm, Sunak has endorsed campaigning from his MPs, London councillors and assembly members against the expansion of the Ulez to cut air pollution in London. He said the Tories should not stop the campaign against the expansion of the clean air zone to the outer London boroughs. At prime minister’s questions he urged the mayor of London to scrap the expansion. The letter to Sunak is signed by world-leading experts on the dangers of air pollution, including Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, whose research led to a new inquest into Ella’s death, Dr Gary Fuller of Imperial College London and Dr Martin Clift of Swansea University. The first expansion of the Ulez in 2021 to an area 18 times the size of the original zone cut the numbers of polluting vehicles by 60% – from 124,000 to 50,000 a day. According to a City Hall report in February, harmful pollution levels in central London have reduced by 46% compared against a scenario without the Ulez. The scheme brought a 56% reduction in nitrogen dioxide levels in central London, 47% in inner London, and 37% in outer London, compared with levels in 2017. Kelly said if the Ulez was not expanded into outer boroughs it would put the fight to clean up London’s air back by 10 years. “There are obviously challenges in terms of helping people who need to replace their vehicles,” he said. “The fact is the government has not provided any funding to help Londoners in that respect.” Neil Garratt, leader of the City Hall Conservatives, said: “We have been clear in our commitment to reducing air pollution and tackling climate change. The authors of the letter ask us to disavow false claims and the individuals making them, but they do not tell us which individuals or claims. The Ulez expansion would produce only a small change in air quality according to the Mayor’s own independent analysis, which we must balance against the severe financial impact for those hit by the mayor’s charge. It is irresponsible for anyone to conflate opposition to the Ulez expansion with science denial.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a991', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/06/country-diary-an-eruption-from-the-river-like-a-fountain-of-sparks', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: An eruption from the river, like a fountain of sparks | Mark Cocker', 'lead': '<strong>Broughton, North Yorkshire:</strong> Whatever flies they were, this was the most beautiful and most holy expression of spring I’ve witnessed this year', 'author': 'Mark Cocker', 'datePublished': '2023-06-06 04:30:00', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562882', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/09ad24373de9c0f9c6deb64fb038d043b9eee309/0_31_4818_2892/500.jpg', 'body': 'The stream known as Broughton Beck was calm, so looking downstream with the late‑afternoon sun, I saw it as an unperturbed linear plane widening to a deep black pool beyond the bridge. Looking upstream, I was confronted by a fierce double glare. There was the light dazzle on the shallows, splintered into linear flakes as it flowed towards me. It was mesmerising. Yet it was nothing compared with the brilliance of the insects above the stream. I’ve struggled subsequently to name them, but they were not mayflies or caddisflies, nor any of the invertebrates classically associated with freshwater in high spring. They were some species of fly, possibly a member of the order Muscidae (house flies) or Anthomyiidae (root-maggot flies), and present in astonishing numbers. Over two days I must have seen many hundreds of thousands on almost every waterbody at Broughton, from any hilltop rill to the secondary streams around this ancient estate. The main appearance was on the beck. Formless glittering shoals upwelled from the stream’s meniscus and spilled outwards like a fountain of sparks. All over the flat surface of the river, from one side to the other, more flies skated randomly back and forth. The most intense showing was a linear formation running relentlessly up and down the line of the beck. I guess they were in some ritualised mating display, which is known in other fly species as a “ghost”. However, there was nothing unliving about this vision. It was life expressed in its most elemental and volatile form, like a flow of electrons, or photons at the heart of the Sun. The movement was so unceasingly quick that it felt as if I was at the edge of what my brain and visual system could embrace. This was odd, because while their collective action was so disturbingly brilliant, if I picked out a single individual by itself, and then globed it in the whole of my attention, it was just your average slow-floating fly. Let it merge, however, back into the silvered smoke of the whole thing and it reunited with the most beautiful and most holy expression of spring that I’ve witnessed in 2023. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a992', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/climate-change-carbon-budget-emissions-payment-usa-uk-germany', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Rich countries with high greenhouse gas emissions could pay $170tn in climate reparations', 'lead': 'Proposed compensation would be paid to developing countries that must transition away from fossil fuels', 'author': 'Nina Lakhani', 'datePublished': '2023-06-05 17:02:37', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562900', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/66f6b342da8522d17d07783a26c20f4830031628/0_113_4938_2963/500.jpg', 'body': 'Rich industrialised countries responsible for excessive levels of greenhouse gas emissions could be liable to pay $170tn in climate reparations by 2050 to ensure targets to curtail climate breakdown are met, a new study calculates. The proposed compensation, which amounts to almost $6tn annually, would be paid to historically low-polluting developing countries that must transition away from fossil fuels despite not having yet used their “fair share” of the global carbon budget, according to the analysis published in the journal Nature Sustainability. The compensation system is based on the idea that the atmosphere is a commons, a natural resource for everyone which has not been used equitably. It is the first scheme where wealthy countries historically responsible for excessive or unjust greenhouse emissions including the UK, US, Germany, Japan and Russia, are held liable to compensate countries which have contributed the least to global heating – but must decarbonise their economies by 2050 if we are to keep global heating below 1.5C and avert the most catastrophic climate breakdown. In this ambitious scenario, the study found that 55 countries including most of sub-Saharan Africa and India would have to sacrifice more than 75% of their fair share of the carbon budget. On the other hand, the UK has used 2.5 times its fair allocation, and would be liable to pay $7.7tn for its excessive emissions by 2050. The US has used more than four times its fair share to become the richest country in the world, and would be responsible for $80tn in reparations under this scheme. “It is a matter of climate justice that if we are asking nations to rapidly decarbonise their economies, even though they hold no responsibility for the excess emissions that are destabilising the climate, then they should be compensated for this unfair burden,” said Andrew Fanning, lead author and visiting research fellow at the University of Leeds’s Sustainability Research Institute. In order to keep global heating to below 1.5C, the total global carbon budget starting from 1960 is 1.8tn tonnes of CO2 or equivalent greenhouse gases, according to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) figures. Using population size, researchers calculated how much 168 countries have over- or under-used their fair share of the global carbon budget since 1960. Some countries were within their fair share allocation, while the global north (the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Israel) have already massively overshot their fair share of the atmospheric commons. Almost 90% of the excess emissions are down to the wealthy global north, while the remainder are from high-emitting countries in the global south, especially oil-rich states such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Five low-emitting countries with large populations – India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria and China (currently the world’s largest emitter) – would be entitled to receive $102tn, for sacrificing their fair share of the carbon budget in the zero emissions scenario. “Climate change reflects clear patterns of atmospheric colonisation,” said Jason Hickel, co-author and professor at the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology at the Autonomous University of Barcelona. “Responsibility for excess emissions is largely held by the wealthy classes [within nations] who have very high consumption and who wield disproportionate power over production and national policy. They are the ones who must bear the costs of compensation.” Demands are mounting to compensate climate-vulnerable countries for the threats they face due to the excessive greenhouse gas emissions of others, as part of a broader climate justice movement to make polluters pay for the climate crisis and green energy transition. Last year at the UN’s Cop27 summit, states agreed to establish a “loss and damage” financing fund to provide funds to poor countries for the irreparable and unavoidable economic and non-economic costs of extreme weather events and slow-onset climate disasters such as sea level rise and melting glaciers. According to research published last month, the world’s top oil, gas and coal companies are responsible for $5.4tn (£4.3tn) in drought, wildfires, sea level rise and melting glaciers among other climate catastrophes expected between 2025 and 2050. This was the first study quantifying the economic burden caused by individual companies that have extracted – and continue to extract – wealth from planet-heating fossil fuels.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a993', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/countries-must-put-aside-national-interests-for-climate-crisis-un-says', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Countries must put aside national interests for climate crisis, UN says', 'lead': 'Simon Stiell tells conference in Bonn the world is at ‘tipping point’ and must fight together for common good', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey in Bonn', 'datePublished': '2023-06-05 15:06:37', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562918', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/3f5fa2d7f23dabf51eb7b1eb8d553166d112f053/0_275_5671_3403/500.jpg', 'body': 'The world is at a “tipping point” in the climate crisis that requires all countries to put aside their national interests to fight for the common good, the UN’s top climate official has warned. Simon Stiell, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, pointed to recent findings from scientists that temperatures were likely to exceed the threshold of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels within the next five years. “Climate change is accelerating, and we are lagging behind in our actions to stem it,” he warned. “Remember the best available science, which doesn’t arbitrate on who needs to do what or who is responsible for what. The science tells us where we are and highlights the scale of response which is required.” Stiell was addressing representatives from nearly 200 countries gathered in Bonn, the UN’s climate headquarters, to discuss how to forge a “course correction” that would put the world on track to meet the aspirations of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and limit global heating to 1.5C. He urged countries to put aside their differences, after more than 30 years of negotiations since the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) was signed in 1992. “I believe we are at a tipping point,” he said. “We know that rapid change often follows a long gestation period. Goodness knows that the gestation period for climate action has been long enough. We need to bring that tipping point forward.” The Bonn conference, a preparatory meeting intended to lay the technical groundwork for the much bigger Cop28 summit that starts in November, opened amid long-simmering contentions. The start of the conference was delayed by two hours as delegates wrangled over the agenda for the next nine days of talks, and the talks have had to start work with a draft agenda while arguments rumbled on. The Guardian understands that the EU and many developing countries wanted an agenda item to discuss the “mitigation work programme”, which deals with countries’ commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, while China fought for a mandate to discuss countries’ plans for adapting to the impacts of the climate crisis. Other key sources of contention included a resolution to phase out fossil fuels, the role of renewable energy, the issue of loss and damage, which refers to funds to help rescue and rehabilitate poor countries struck by climate disaster, and the global stocktake, which is an assessment of how far off track governments are in meeting their Paris pledges. Stiell did not name these issues directly, but urged governments to find common ground. “There is at times tension between national interest and the global common good. I urge delegates to be brave, to see that by prioritising the common good, you also serve your national interests – and act accordingly,” he said. Madeleine Diouf Sarr, the chair of the least developed countries grouping at the UN negotiations, urged all nations to act in the interests of the most vulnerable. “The success of Cop28 hinges on progress achieved at this Bonn conference. We have to lay the foundations for a Cop28 decision that leads to the curbing of global emissions in line with the 1.5C target and increased funds provided to our countries so we can address the impacts of climate change,” she said. Alden Meyer, the senior associate at the thinktank E3G, told the Guardian that avoiding a permanent rise in temperatures to more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels was still possible. “New agreements and commitments by governments and businesses can bring about a transformational roadmap to modernise economies and put global climate action back on track this decade,” he said. “With six months to go [before Cop28], this meeting in Bonn is a pivotal point on the road. Governments must collaborate to set high expectations for Cop28 outcomes on the new policies and agreements Cop28 must deliver to put global action back on track, and they must build bridges with each other to get there.” The host country of Cop28, the United Arab Emirates, would be under particular scrutiny, he added. UAE is a producer of oil and gas, which confirmed plans with Opec last week to expand its fossil fuel production next year. Sultan Al Jaber, who will act as president of Cop28, is the head of UAE’s national oil company, Adnoc, a dual role that has enraged climate campaigners. Meyer said: “The UAE must use the moment as a chance to build trust, credibility, and confidence in its leadership of Cop28. What the UAE says and does, including any new initiatives they launch, will be a test of their credibility.” Another pressing concern for Stiell, who took the reins at the UNFCCC last year, is the budget for the UNFCCC secretariat. It is already regarded as inadequate for the expanded work that is required in running the annual Cop summits and administering the 2015 Paris climate agreement, but many countries want the UN to do more to provide practical help. Stiell warned of a “massive funding gap”, and urged delegates to agree a budget increase, and for governments to pay what they already owed.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a994', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/airborne-dna-accidentally-collected-by-air-quality-filters-reveals-state-of-species', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Airborne DNA accidentally collected by air-quality filters reveals state of species', 'lead': 'Monitoring stations that already test for pollution could have dual purpose of mapping declines in biodiversity, reveals new study', 'author': 'Phoebe Weston', 'datePublished': '2023-06-05 15:00:14', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562937', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/bea62c7972df822c14093ab37ffde8a154ff6606/278_678_4558_2734/500.jpg', 'body': 'From owls to hedgehogs to fungi, genetic material from plants and animals is being inadvertently hoovered up by air-quality monitoring stations around the world, creating an untapped “vault of biodiversity data”, according to a new scientific paper. Globally, thousands of air filters are continually testing for heavy metals and other pollutants in the atmosphere. Scientists are now realising that this monitoring network is also picking up invisible traces of genetic material known as airborne environmental DNA (eDNA) from bits of hair, feathers, saliva and pollen. Testing eDNA from two UK air-quality stations – one in a London park and another in a rural location outside Edinburgh – revealed the presence of more than 180 fungi, insects, mammals, birds and amphibians, including badgers, dormice, little owls, hedgehogs and smooth newts. Plant eDNA was also collected, including yarrow, daisies, nettles, wheat, soya beans and cabbages. The data can tell scientists which animals live nearby, and could become an important tool in monitoring declines in biodiversity by amassing large amounts of local data over long periods of time. “This infrastructure may represent a tremendous opportunity to collect high-resolution biodiversity data on national scales,” researchers wrote in the paper published in Current Biology. “This is gamechanging for our approach to biodiversity monitoring on land.” The increasing rate of species extinctions globally is a huge concern to scientists. “The potential of this cannot be overstated,” said first author Joanne Littlefair from Queen Mary University of London. “Almost every country has some kind of air pollution-monitoring system or network, either government-owned or private, and in many cases both. This could solve a global problem of how to measure biodiversity at a massive scale.” Air monitoring networks, some of which have been running for decades, are concentrated in Europe, Asia, and central and north America, but some are also found across the global south. Collecting eDNA data does not interfere with their ability to monitor air quality. Researchers found they could still collect eDNA from an eight-month-old filter stored at ambient temperatures, and it could last for decades if frozen. They are now encouraging monitoring stations to keep the filters to preserve the eDNA information they contain. Andrew Brown from the UK’s National Physical Laboratory and one of the paper’s authors said: “For the past two decades of my career, I’ve been working on air-quality pollution to assess exposure of the population to potentially harmful pollutants. “To find out this extremely well-established network can be used by an entirely different field of science – and that it has all this hidden potential that we never thought about – is extremely exciting.” The research was carried out in collaboration with a team from York University in Canada. Sampling of eDNA is more developed in aquatic ecosystems, where ecological consultants often use it to survey for the presence of great crested newts. Using airborne systems, scientists from Lund University have been able to gather DNA from 85 insect species, and zoo species have also been identified by sampling the surrounding air. All this opens up a non-invasive way of tracking wildlife, with no need for the animal to be nearby, unlike camera traps or acoustic monitoring. Dr Fabian Roger at Lund University, who was not involved in this latest study, said: “What is exciting is that these filters are collected from an existing monitoring network, which presents an up-and-running network that could be co-opted for biodiversity monitoring. Still at question, he said, was the usefulness of the data in biodiversity monitoring: “Detecting some species some times is not the same as detecting a signal of biodiversity change, which is representative for a larger area.” Researchers still have to analyse data from multiple stations over an extended period. “I fully agree that the potential could be great,” said Roger.

This yoghurt made with ingredients from the other side of the globe points to the contradictory nature of so-called local food today: though the term holds appeal for customers, nearly two-thirds of whom perceive local food to be more environmentally friendly, experts suggest it may not always mean what you think. “Most of it is bullshit,” says Austin, Texas-based Errol Schweizer, who led grocery merchandising for Whole Foods from 2009 to 2016. “Every retailer has a different definition [of “local”]. Even the retailers themselves will have different definitions, depending on where they are, and the original purpose of localization has totally gotten lost.” Local food first started to attract attention against the backdrop of globalized supply chains at a time when US shoppers had become accustomed to eating quinoa grown in Bolivia or salmon caught in Norway. Local became a selling point in the early 2000s as the result of an intellectual backlash to the growing hegemony in grocery stores and prevalence of highly processed foods, says Schweizer, who points to the publishing of Michael Pollan’s The Omnivore’s Dilemma as one inflection point. Proponents like Pollan asserted that buying local would mean fresher and healthier food with a lower carbon footprint. What followed was a “flurry of activity to figure out how to re-localize supply chains” that had been decimated by the advent of 20th-century national grocery chains, which had de-localized in the name of efficiency, says Schweizer. There was never well-defined agreement about what the term actually meant, though. According to Food Tank founder Danielle Nierenberg, “local” is usually understood to refer to food grown within 100 miles (160km) of where it’s sold and eaten, a perception bolstered by books such as The 100 Mile Diet by Alisa Smith and JB MacKinnon. But the US Department of Agriculture’s definition of “local” in the 2008 Farm Bill includes food grown in the same state or within 400 miles (640km) of where it is finally marketed – and even that definition isn’t regulated the way a label such as “organic” is. That’s led to a lack of clarity and consistency in how the term is deployed in supermarkets across the country, with each grocer defining the label for itself. In the produce aisle at a HarvesTime in Chicago, for example, microgreens classified as local are grown at a farm about 45 miles (70km) away in Carpentersville, Illinois. At a Union Market in Brooklyn, the “local eggs” category includes cartons from a farm 158 miles (250km) away in Pennsylvania, one 17 miles (27km) away in New Jersey and another 270 miles (430km) away in upstate New York. Meanwhile near Dallas, Central Market posts signs with the outline of Texas promoting “local flavor” that sometimes point to items that are grown in-state, like wine from the Frio Canyon Vineyard, 340 miles (550km) away. Other times, the same sign seems to have more to do with where a food company is headquartered, as is the case with Austin-based Lamme’s Candies, 200 miles (320km) away. Lamme’s features Texas heavily in its branding but gets its chocolate from the California company Guittard, which in turn sources cocoa from Ecuador (around 2,500 miles, or 4,000km, away) and West Africa (almost 6,000 miles, or 10,000km, away) – a fact you wouldn’t find out without poking around online. Whole Foods, HarvesTime, Union Market and Central Market did not respond to requests for comment. This proliferation of the term in grocery stores arose in part from the fact that without a strict definition, “local food” was first used as a kind of shorthand for a type of food that addressed broken food systems. But that understanding was flawed from the start, says San Juan, Puerto Rico-based Alicia Kennedy, author of the forthcoming book No Meat Required. “When we talk about the concept of local food as an idea or movement, what comes to mind for a lot of people in the US is a sort of bourgeois white affectation,” says Kennedy. “The idea of local food in a US context stops short of saying what to do about poverty or white supremacy in how people are granted access to food.” Many of the most prominent voices that helped popularize the idea – people like Pollan, Alice Waters and Mark Bittman – are white. What’s more, Schweizer says that based on his experience at Whole Foods, local food in the US is frequently more expensive, since it’s distributed through supply chains that are often less efficient than their national or international counterparts. Those factors combine to make the local food conversation feel inaccessible to many. Plus, Schweizer adds, the local food conversation didn’t “reignite more of a local infrastructure supply chain complete with manufacturing, processing, storage and the like, and that is the only way you can actually do something legitimate or authentic”. Going to farmers’ markets or buying into a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program, which are often presented as more authentic local alternatives to chain grocery stores, aren’t silver bullets, either. First off, Schweizer notes that though those direct-to-consumer avenues get a lot of attention, they make up a tiny percentage of the industry – direct sales and farmers’ markets are worth $3bn (£2.4bn) a year, compared with the grocery industry’s $850bn (£680bn) a year, he says. And even at a farmers’ market, the term “local” isn’t straightforward. Vermont-based farmworker and floral designer Amber Tamm, for example, has been a first-hand witness to farmers’ market stands labeling produce that was actually shipped in from elsewhere as local. She recalls being instructed to sell produce as local even though she knew some of it didn’t come from the farm she was supposed to be representing. “They knew that this is what customers wanted to hear,” she says. According to Schweizer, “local” “used to be about climate change and developing strong supply chains and regional food systems. Now it’s essentially a marketing gimmick.” These days, Kennedy adds, local food has “worn out its welcome as a monolithic concept”. That doesn’t mean she’s uninterested in where her food comes from – just that she thinks we’re going to need to ask questions that go beyond how far away our kale was grown to fix the food system. And for Tamm, that means prioritizing local in terms of her produce, but intentionally buying some imports with the intention of supporting “peasant farmers globally”. Kennedy says it’s more useful to think about the bigger picture of where food comes from, including the ecological impacts of how it was grown and other effects on its place of origin. When thinking about how to redesign food systems, there are many other factors to consider: everything from affordability and availability to race, class, government subsidies and international trade agreements – in addition to, yes, how far away it was packaged or grown. In other words, the “local” label at your nearest grocery store may not mean all that much. But maybe rather than seeing that as a reason to throw up your hands, you can take it as an invitation to dive deeper into what it might take to actually build a food system that works for everyone.

The 45 samples collected from leg two, running from Cabo Verde to South Africa, showed microplastic concentrations from 92-1,884, while in leg three – between Cape Town and Itajaí, Brazil – the concentrations ranged from 160-1,492 per cubic metre. A filter on the boats can pick up plastic particles measuring between 0.03mm and 5mm. The samples are sent daily to the NOC for analysis, with support from the University of Rhode Island. The highest concentrations of microplastics were found close to coasts and urban areas, such as readings of 816-1,712 per cubic metre off the coast of South Africa, and also in the “garbage patch” areas of the sea, where currents cause plastic to accumulate. Concentrations during the 2017-18 Ocean Race ranged from 50-100 per cubic metre. Samples taken near the planet’s most remote area, Point Nemo, which is 2,688km (1,450 nautical miles) from land in all directions, revealed 320 microplastic particles per cubic metre, compared with 9-41 in the last race. The most abundant chemical in the plastics is polyethylene, which is used for single-use packaging, plastic bags and containers such as bottles. Fulfer expressed dismay at the high concentrations nearer to shore. “This is really concerning because coastal areas are so vital for fisheries production and the blue economy,” she said. “All these microplastics are available for organisms to ingest, which could then impact our health.” The microplastics research is part of a science programme being conducted during the 62,000km Ocean Race, with sailors collecting data such as sea temperatures, CO2, oxygen and trace elements in locations scientific research vessels can rarely reach, and sharing it with a number of science organisations and publicly at theoceanracescience.com.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a997', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/dom-phillips-book-how-to-save-the-amazon', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Journalism mustn’t be silenced’: colleagues to complete slain reporter’s book', 'lead': 'How to Save the Amazon will be published so Dom Phillips’ work telling the stories of Amazon defenders does not die with him', 'author': 'Constance Malleret in Rio de Janeiro', 'datePublished': '2023-06-05 09:30:34', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.562990', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/4fdc2797731e97a818616b6b465065a022feab71/0_399_6000_3600/500.jpg', 'body': 'One year after Dom Phillips was killed in the Brazilian Amazon, friends and colleagues have come together in a show of journalistic solidarity to keep his legacy alive and finish the book the British journalist was working on at the time of his death. Phillips and his Brazilian companion, the Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, were killed while returning from the remote Javari valley in the western Amazon last June. Three men have been charged with murder and are being held in high-security prisons while awaiting a decision on whether they will face trial. Phillips, a respected correspondent and longtime Guardian collaborator, had been working on a book called How to Save the Amazon: Ask the People Who Know. His fatal expedition last year to interview Indigenous defenders fighting criminal activity in the Javari valley was to have been one of his final reporting trips. In a tribute to the deep admiration Phillips elicited as both a person and journalist, his friends and colleagues are now striving to ensure that his work telling the stories of Amazon defenders does not die with him. His widow, Alessandra Sampaio, asked a group of writers from Brazil, the US and the UK to finish the book Phillips started, which he had pitched as a “character-driven, deeply researched, campaigning, environmental travel book that aims to entertain, inform and, most importantly, mobilise readers” about the fate of the Amazon. “Amid the horror that followed the news of Bruno and Dom’s death, we wanted to focus on something positive, and the most important thing we could think of was to complete the work that Dom had started,” said Jonathan Watts, one of the journalists coordinating the book’s route to publication. “Good journalism mustn’t be silenced.” As well as Watts, who is global environment writer for the Guardian and co-founder of the Amazon-based news site Sumaúma, the team of experienced Amazon writers includes Eliane Brum (author and co-founder of Sumaúma), Tom Phillips (Latin America correspondent for the Guardian), Jon Lee Anderson (staff writer for the New Yorker), Katia Brasil (founder of Amazônia Real) and Andrew Fishman (president and co-founder of the Intercept Brasil). They will carry out trips retracing Phillips’ steps to write the book’s remaining chapters, working with the partly completed manuscript and Phillips’ extensive notes and research. “Dom was murdered while telling the story of Amazon defenders getting killed. Leaving his book unfinished would mean letting the destroyers of the Amazon win without a fight. It would be a disservice to his legacy and everything we believe in as journalists,” said Fishman. A number of other journalists who knew and admired Phillips have offered to help with proofreading and factchecking. The team of writers secured initial funds to start the project and has now partnered with Phillips’ family to raise a final £16,000 to pay for reporting trips to the Amazon and other work needed to complete the manuscript, they said in a statement. “The book is particularly important right now because the Amazon is a battleground of ideas within Brazil and at the centre of many of the big disputes that are threatening the new government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva,” said Watts. Phillips’ sister, Sian Phillips, said the project was not only a lasting tribute to her brother’s life’s work, but also a crucially important resource to continue raising awareness about the threats facing the Amazon rainforest and the Indigenous people who protect it. “If Dom and Bruno had not been murdered, the book would have been important for the conservation of the Amazon. But now, due to the international outcry after the murders, the potential of the book is greater because many more people will read it,” she said. “It’s a great responsibility on my family, on Dom’s family and friends, to ensure that the book is finished.” - If you want to help finish Dom Phillips’ book on the Amazon you can contribute here.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a998', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/conservationists-welcome-gillnet-fishing-ban-in-great-barrier-reef-world-heritage-area', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Conservationists welcome gillnet fishing ban in Great Barrier Reef world heritage area', 'lead': 'The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, announced the $160m plan on Monday afternoon', 'author': 'Lisa Cox', 'datePublished': '2023-06-05 08:14:08', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563008', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/efb88ba5838fa909684e5651e1047311c9116c6d/0_3_5390_3234/500.jpg', 'body': 'The federal and Queensland governments will phase out commercial gillnet fishing in the Great Barrier Reef world heritage area by mid-2027 and create new net-free zones to better protect endangered marine species. The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, announced the $160m plan Monday afternoon and said it would significantly reduce net fishing and high-risk fishing on the reef that injure and kill threatened dugongs, turtles, dolphins and protected shark species. Plibersek will also ask the Queensland government to declare the hammerhead shark a “no-take” species for commercial fishers in Queensland waters, something long called for by oceans campaigners. Part of the funding will be used to buy out gillnet licences, with the majority of gillnets to be removed by the end of this year and a total ban by mid-2027. “We know one of the most immediate threats to health of reef is unsustainable fishing practices. It causes damage throughout the reef, as threatened marine life like dugongs, turtles and dolphins are caught in nets and drown,” Plibersek said. “The removal of gillnets in net-free zones on the reef has already helped boost local fish populations. We want to see this happen right across the reef.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The money will also fund the creation of new net-free zones in the northern third of the Great Barrier Reef and parts of the Gulf of Carpentaria, accelerate the implementation of a sustainable fisheries strategy and mandate the use of independent data validation on commercial fishing vessels. A phase-out of gillnets and an accelerated rollout of a sustainable fisheries strategy were among recommendations of a report from a UN-backed mission to the reef that concluded the world’s biggest coral reef system should be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger. The announcement comes after a long campaign by conservation groups for an end to gillnet fishing on the reef. The nets, which can measure more than a kilometre in length, are used to catch fish such as barramundi and mackerel but can also entangle, injure and kill other, endangered species. WWF-Australia, which campaigned for seven years for an end to commercial gillnet fishing, said it was a “globally significant moment for ocean conservation, fisheries management and the Great Barrier Reef”. “If all goes to plan, by June 2027 we’ll have a net-free reef where dugongs, turtles, dolphins and other threatened species can swim without the threat of becoming entangled and drowning in a gill net, and that’s a cause for global celebration,” the chief executive, Dermot O’Gorman, said. The Australian Marine Conservation Society said “permanently removing these devastating nets will help populations of threatened species to recover”. The AMCS has for years called for better protection for threatened hammerhead sharks, including the endangered scalloped hammerhead shark, and welcomed the decision to have hammerheads declared a no-take species. “The ongoing capture of endangered hammerheads for meat and fins has long been out of step with protecting and recovering threatened species in the reef,” the chief executive, Darren Kindleysides said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a999', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/rethink-reform-rebuild-7-steps-to-save-the-amazon', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Rethink, reform, rebuild: 7 steps to save the Amazon', 'lead': 'As the world’s biggest rainforest degrades fast towards its tipping point, finding solutions is more urgent than ever.

From Anapu to Belo Monte, the 86-mile road – a small portion of the nearly 2,500-mile highway – has passed by some of the most violent communities, disrupted waterways and degraded land in the Amazon. For most of the two-and-a-half-hour drive, the hillsides on both sides of the road have almost more cows than trees. The land is so purged of foliage and wildlife that it is hard to believe this is a passage through the world’s biggest rainforest. It looks more like an endless ranch. The other side of the river is even worse, as this is the site of the biggest hydroelectric dam in the Amazon – a Mordor-esque rampart of concrete behind which lies a cemetery of thousands of white trees drowned by the reservoir. This is where the perverse logic of growing the economy by running down nature reaches its grim apotheosis. And this is where the search for solutions to the Amazon’s degradation must focus, because it is on this road that the problems began. Fail to understand that and no matter how much money, labour or technology is thrown at the issue by governments, companies and civil society groups, it is unlikely to be effective. Like any fire, the conflagration needs to be put out at its source. A potted history of the rainforest reveals why. For thousands of years, Indigenous people lived in the Amazon, not just in harmonious balance with what was already there but also actively planting trees that provided food and medicine, thus nurturing and strengthening the environment. By one estimate, 20% of the forest was planted by ancient civilisations. This started to change after the first European colonisers invaded five centuries ago, followed by prospectors and bandeirantes – fortune hunters who pushed into the forest in search of Indigenous people to enslave, and lost cities of gold. It was not until the 1970s that industrial-scale deforestation took hold, when Brazil’s military dictatorship built a road through the rainforest as a centrepiece of its nation-building ambitions. This opened the way for a wave of settlers who were encouraged to carve up and clear the land, regardless of existing Indigenous communities or any concern for nature. Since then, the pattern has been repeated across ever-wider swathes of the Amazonian region. First, illegal prospectors and loggers invade, next road-builders open up, and then landgrabbers seize and burn, followed by ranchers and farmers, and finally politicians, who retrospectively legitimise all of the previous illegal activity. It is essentially colonialism, but from within the borders of a nation state for the benefit of a wealthy, often global, elite. On the ground, the result of the policy of violence is social and environmental chaos: ever more people, ever more destruction and ever more crime, but diminishing rates of economic return and increasing climatic impact. Today the rainforest is fast degrading towards what scientists call a “tipping point”, after which it irreversibly dries up because it is no longer capable of generating its own rain. That, of course, puts an even higher premium on agricultural produce and even more pressure on the land. Breaking this vicious cycle is essential for global climate stability, the irrigation of regional crops and the long-term wellbeing of the Amazon’s human and non-human inhabitants. How to do that remains elusive. The first Lula government came closest. With Marina Silva as environment minister, it put in place policies that led to a more than 80% reduction in deforestation. Since then, however, successive governments have only made matters worse, culminating in the catastrophic administration of Jair Bolsonaro, when deforestation increased by 60% in just four years. Finding solutions is now more urgent than ever. Countless universities, NGOs and businesses have devoted themselves to this task. The new Lula government will host an Amazon summit later this year to address the challenge. Guardian contributor Dom Phillips was murdered last year while researching this subject for a book: How to Save the Amazon: Ask the People Who Know. * * * Step 1 Political and Indigenous leadership But who to ask first and where to begin? After the Trans-Amazonian Highway, the next stop is Brasília, the centre of power in Brazil. Nationalist paranoia and market failure – rewarding those who destroy and penalising those who defend – have to be addressed in the search for any long-term solution. Political leadership must therefore be the starting point. Lula’s current presidency appeared to present a great opportunity. After winning the election last year, the former trade union leader made an international pledge to cut deforestation to zero by 2030 and to halt the expansion of the agricultural frontier. He also created an Indigenous ministry, which gives more power than ever to the people who have the best record of maintaining a healthy forest. Efforts are under way to drive illegal miners from Indigenous territories. Most encouragingly, Lula reappointed the Amazon’s greatest champion, Marina Silva, as environment minister. She has declared protected status to public land the size of Spain through the creation of Indigenous territories and national reserves, and vowed to “fight for the Amazon”. But the forces against her are mounting rapidly. Congress, which is dominated by the rural lobby, has moved to gut her ministry’s powers. The state-managed oil company Petrobras is also up in arms about the environment ministry’s refusal to approve an oil-drilling licence in the mouth of the Amazon. The construction industry wants Silva out of the way so it can build a new road through Amazonas. Most state governors in the Amazon are pro-mining and pro-ranching Bolsonarists. Faced with this resistance, Lula may once again be tempted to ditch his 21st-century climate concerns along with his troublesomely effective environment minister and go back to his 20th-century instincts to build more infrastructure and open more oilwells. If Silva goes, so does Brazil’s environmental credibility. Step 2 Land reform If Silva remains in power, however, there is no shortage of ambitious plans she could adopt. The Amazon Environmental Research Institute says 20m hectares (49m acres) of land could be better conserved through agrarian reforms, such as titling smallholders and compensating them for forest stewardship, while another 10m hectares could be saved by investing in sustainable agriculture. More ambitious still, the Science Panel for the Amazon, which aims to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) but for the rainforest, has proposed “arcs of restoration” that would help to regenerate degraded and cleared land. Such policies would be gamechangers. Step 3 Hold foreign countries, businesses and consumers to account To maintain the current positive course, international support needs to be ramped up, and fast. Foreign nations, businesses and consumers must accept their responsibility for much of the destruction of the Amazon, which has accelerated to sell more beef, soy and iron ore to Europe, China, the US and other industrialised markets. The global north also needs to compensate the global south, including Brazil, for climate damage and to pay for the carbon-reducing benefits of natural sinks such as the Amazon. Without this, there is no economic incentive or moral argument for Brazil to reduce deforestation. It seems that last point is finally being understood. At the Cop15 biodiversity summit in Montreal last December, rich nations promised between $20bn (£16bn) and $30bn a year for poorer, biodiverse countries like Brazil. A month earlier, the Cop27 summit in Sharm el-Sheikh had seen a similarly groundbreaking pledge of “loss and damage” climate payments. One vehicle for acting early is the Amazon Fund, which has raised more than $1bn, mostly from Norway, which is being used for rainforest projects. More is needed. Encouragingly, President Biden recently asked the US Congress to make its first contribution of $500m to the fund and the UK prime minister Rishi Sunak pledged £80m. This money needs to flow quickly and be increased in the future. Foreign governments also need to crack down on deforestation-related trade. The EU recently enacted progressive legislation in this area. The US and particularly China – the main export market for soy and iron ore from the Amazon – should be encouraged to follow. Step 4 Radically reform the beef industry Beef needs to be the primary target as the industry accounts for about 80% of agriculture-related deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. Cattle are used as occupying armies to consolidate land ownership in an extension of the nationalist mindset encouraged by the generals in the 1970s. The government still gives subsidies to ranchers. Looked at in terms of revenue for every hectare of forest destroyed, it is horrendously inefficient and provides relatively few jobs. The world’s biggest meatpacker, JBS, and rivals such as Marfrig need to be more transparent, efficient and accountable to the public as well as to their shareholders. The prices of their products should also include the indirect damage they do to the Amazon, and subsidies removed. Once these costs are forced on to the balance sheet, only the most productive ranches will remain. Carlos Nobre, Brazil’s most influential climate scientist, says consolidation of the beef industry was long overdue. “It’s possible to increase production of beef and reduce deforestation. It can be done. The technology exists. We can improve them genetically. It’s a question of going to scale,” he says. “You can feed the world for ever using less and less land.” Step 5 Build intelligent (rather than concrete) infrastructure Technology offers other solutions. Instead of integrating the Amazon destructively with roads, as in the past, moves are under way to build a less intrusive and more sustainable communication and energy network. Brazil already boasts the world’s most sophisticated satellite system for monitoring biomes. One analytical platform, MapBiomas, is able to rapidly identify whether land changes from forest to cattle pasture, soy plantation, fruit orchard, mining site or other categories. This is now used by banks to determine whether land owners are entitled to loans or sanctioned for environmental violations. The next step, according to Tasso Azevedo, the founder of MapBiomas, is to provide solar panels and satellite internet access to remote communities so they can quickly denounce invasions of their land and pollution of their rivers in return for social benefits. “We need to think of technology as infrastructure. Internet in remote areas is now possible, which helps access to health and education,” he says. Environmental defenders believe improved communications could help with enforcement, which is vital to end impunity, but public security institutions need to put more boots on the ground and helicopters in the air. “The population now has internet. They tell us what is happening. Now we need a rapid reaction squad,” says a local public prosecutor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We have to identify and support communities that are bases of vigilance and detection. This means building up the capacity of environment protection and indigenous affairs agencies, which were gutted during the Bolsonaro and Michel Temer administrations.” Step 6 Create a bioeconomy The market failure of Amazon destruction needs to be recognised. The World Bank – which has previously financed forest-clearing industries – recently issued a report showing that the economic losses caused by Amazon deforestation, estimated at $317bn, are seven times higher for Brazil than the gains from extractive industries, such as ranching, mining and logging for Brazil. Forest dwellers need alternatives. This needs to be handled sensitively with regulations to ensure money flows do not cause more problems than they solve. Instead of making money from landgrabbing, illegal mining and destructive cattle ranching, people have to be persuaded they are better off with a standing forest. That can mean ecological stewardship payments for smallholders, subsidies for sustainable agriculture, stronger law enforcement to protect Indigenous territories and carbon credits for big landowners and traditional communities. The latter is essential but controversial as the carbon credit market is unregulated and open to abuse. “Now we are seeing a new wave of carbon cowboys promising the earth to indigenous and traditional communities,” says Paulo Moutinho of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute. Lula’s government needs to build a system to ensure money is channelled towards projects that offer the maximum benefit to the climate and local communities, rather than open a new era of green colonialism. The promised land at the end of this journey is a bioeconomy that grows in tandem with the forest, providing decent livelihoods to local communities, promoting agroforestry that rewards biodiversity, and punishing corporations that take more than they give. Such a system does not yet exist in any comprehensive form, but there are concrete examples at the grassroots and a raft of initiatives at a state, national and global level. In some ways, the bioeconomy is a 21st century attempt to achieve the balance that indigenous communities mastered long ago in growing the forest while providing livelihoods. The academic brothers Carlos and Ismael Nobre have sketched out how Brazil could become an “environmental powerhouse” by adopting what they call Amazon 4.0 – a economic model of new technology and advanced conservation thinking. For idealists, the bioeconomy is the best potential vaccine to the virus of destructive neoliberal capitalism. But it could just as easily prove the latest greenwashing buzzword. The Pará state governor Helder Barbalho touts the bioeconomy as a way to pitch for international investment. His administration has just announced the creation of a bioeconomy park with 4.2m hectares devoted to carbon capture and will soon host a large bioeconomy conference in the state capital of Belém. Forest residents remain suspicious of Barbalho’s motives, but he is at least willing to engage with Lula’s government. Lula has created a new government post, secretary for bioeconomy, with the challenging task of inventing a whole new economic system. The holder, Carina Pimenta, says she is wary of including carbon credits and prefers to direct government support and subsidies away from industrial monocultures and towards sustainable forest products and communities. “Brazil must define its own concept of the bioeconomy,” Pimenta says. “It must be based on what already works, such as extractive reserves.” These reserves are occupied by traditional riverine communities that harvest forest resources sustainably. On the Trans-Amazonian Highway, there is a possibility of changing direction once you reach Altamira, a frontier town for ranching and mining. Switch here from car to boat, and after four or five hours on the Xingu and Iriri Rivers you finally get beyond the reservoir of the Belo Monte dam and can once again see the true wealth of the Amazon: dense forest, clear tributaries and abundant biodiversity. This is the territory of the Cantinas Network, a cooperative of sustainable producers who live in extractive reserves and provide an example of what the bioeconomy might look like. Now, with radio and basic internet, they pool resources, knowledge and harvests of brazil nuts, babaçu oil and other products so they can sell together at a better price. There is a vibrant local culture and strong commitment to maintaining the forest. The seed is here of an alternative way of existing with the forest that blends decent livelihoods, high technology and a healthy forest. But there is a long way to go before this can be any kind of model. Healthcare and education need to be improved, river transport electrified, and prices guaranteed. The state must also provide better protection against the constant threats of incursion by landgrabbers, loggers and illegal miners. Step 7 Rethink the concept of national security A change of outlook is essential. For hundreds of years, the function of the state has been to encourage extraction and open up new markets – an essentially colonial, destructive project. If that is to end, as the imminent approach of the Amazon tipping point suggests it must, then governments need a different set of priorities and a new way of thinking about national identity and security. That is true, too, of the police and military, which have neglected or been co-opted by environmental criminals. State power should be directed towards 21st-century threats to climate stability, the physical integrity of national biomes and the wellbeing of the population. For the moment, that is far from mainstream thinking. But as the economic and strategic threats of climate change become more apparent in the future, this argument should become more persuasive. Hopefully, there will still be a forest left by then.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a99a', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/country-diary-an-orange-tip-rescue-mission', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: An orange tip rescue mission | Phil Gates', 'lead': '<strong>Crook, County Durham:</strong> Keeping our garden breeding colony going for almost 40 years is painstaking, and not entirely altruistic', 'author': 'Phil Gates', 'datePublished': '2023-06-05 04:30:18', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563046', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/fe99eff93ef3a3d15bfa364ac572c700975fc89c/0_158_1560_936/500.jpg', 'body': 'My hands reek of garlic. I’ve been pulling up invasive Alliaria petiolata, alias garlic mustard. Our resident population of orange tip butterflies lay eggs on it, so we always leave some in one corner of the garden, but if it was all allowed to set seed it would run riot. Making certain that we only cull plants that haven’t been used by ovipositing butterflies is a slow process. Each needs to be checked for tiny orange eggs or green caterpillars that align themselves along the pods, camouflaged by an almost perfect colour match. Last year, I nearly consigned one to the compost heap, rescuing it in the nick of time. We kept it in the conservatory, watching it chew relentlessly through garlicky pods; a green eating machine that reached maturity in a few days. It stopped feeding on 25 June 2022 and attached itself to the plant stem with a silken girdle, like the safety sling telephone engineers wear when climbing telegraph poles. Next morning, it had transformed into a sleek, straw-coloured, hard-skinned pupa. With remarkable developmental foresight, its temporary sarcophagus incorporated a perfectly shaped space for wings that had yet to form, anticipating its own metamorphosis. Unseen, inside, through summer, autumn and winter, the caterpillar’s enzymes digested its body and reassembled the components into a butterfly. This spring, on 5 April, 284 days later, we found a female orange tip fluttering against the window. We set her free on aubretia flowers. It’s likely that she has laid her own eggs among the plants I’m pulling up today, so I’m taking extra care: this year, it’s personal. Garlic mustard is very common hereabouts. So are orange tip butterflies. Keeping this garden breeding colony going for almost 40 years hasn’t really been about conservation. It’s a selfish pleasure, revisiting the metamorphosis of a butterfly that I first witnessed as a child: a marvellous annual cycle of renewal that, unlike us, never grows old. One way of thinking about biodiversity is as an accountancy exercise, a profit and loss spreadsheet. Another is to recognise that there are stories attached to every single species on the planet, there to be discovered. Telling each other those stories is a uniquely human trait. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a99c', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/climate-crisis-rich-nations-undermining-work-to-help-poor-countries-research-suggests', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Climate crisis: rich nations undermining work to help poor countries, research suggests', 'lead': 'Oxfam report says only $11.5bn (£9.2bn) of climate finance in 2020 devoted to helping vulnerable states', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey in Bonn', 'datePublished': '2023-06-04 23:01:12', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563089', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/668984eb4d1564f14d674d9499961a32fb59030d/0_198_4442_2665/500.jpg', 'body': 'Rich nations are undermining work to protect poor and vulnerable countries from the impacts of the climate crisis, by providing loans instead of grants, siphoning off money from other aid projects or mislabelling cash, new research suggests. Only $11.5bn (£9.2bn) of climate finance from rich countries in 2020 was devoted to helping poor countries adapt to extreme weather, despite increasing incidences of climate-related disaster, according to a report from the charity Oxfam. Nafkote Dabi, Oxfam’s international climate change policy lead, said this was inadequate given the scale of the problem. “Don’t be fooled into thinking $11.5bn is anywhere near enough for low- and middle-income countries to help their people with more and bigger floods, hurricanes, firestorms, droughts and other terrible harms brought about by climate change,” she said. “People in the US spend four times that each year feeding their cats and dogs.” Under a promise made by the developed world in 2009, developing countries should have been receiving $100bn a year in climate finance from 2020, made up of funds to help countries adapt to climate impacts and to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. But that pledge has so far gone unmet, with only $83bn provided in 2020. Estimates suggest that the $100bn figure should be exceeded this year, but Oxfam said standard estimates overstated the true amounts. That is because some of the money has been taken from existing overseas aid budgets, and some of what is counted as climate finance includes funds primarily allocated to development projects such as health and education, with only tangential benefits to the climate. Oxfam also argues that finance should be provided in the form of grants rather than loans, though some donor countries defend the use of loans. If all of these sums are stripped out, then only $21bn to $24.5bn of the $83bn remains as pure climate finance without strings attached, according to Oxfam in its Climate Finance Shadow Report 2023, published on Monday. Climate finance will come under close scrutiny this week, at UN negotiations to be held in Bonn, ahead of the Cop28 climate summit that starts on 30 November. This year’s summit – Cop stands for “conference of the parties” under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change – will be hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a major oil-producing country that plans to expand its fossil fuel production capacity. Sultan Al Jaber, president-designate of Cop28, is also head of UAE’s national oil company, Adnoc, a dual role that many campaigners have warned represents a conflict of interests. Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland and twice a climate envoy for the UN, led a group of prominent women in writing to the UN at the weekend, asking for a clear “firewall” to be set up between the Cop preparations and UAE’s oil industry. “So far, UAE hasn’t shown signs of prioritising action to address the impact of climate change on vulnerable people, especially women,” they wrote. “Some are saying that the talks are heading for a car crash – instead of leading to address the emergency for people, climate and nature, we are also facing an emergency for the survival of the UN multilateral system and democracy.” At this week’s preparatory meeting, governments will discuss how to set up a fund to help poor countries with loss and damage, which means the ravages of climate breakdown that are too severe for countries to adapt to them. They will also lay out some of the groundwork for assessing how close countries are to meeting their pledges on cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, a process known as the “global stocktake”. Al Jaber has talked of the need for a “course correction” at Cop28 that would put the world on track to meet the Paris goals. He told the Guardian, in a rare interview, that boosting the deployment of renewable energy was key and that there were encouraging signs. But he said governments and activists needed to show unity. “We need to stop the fingerpointing. We need to stop this polarisation. We need to flip the page and start focusing on being optimistic, positive and working together in harmony.” • This article was amended on 5 June 2023 to remove a reference to $88bn where $83bn was meant.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a99d', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/04/why-we-need-to-respect-earths-last-great-wilderness-the-ocean', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Why we need to respect Earth’s last great wilderness – the ocean', 'lead': 'There are plans to harness our seas to help tackle the effects of the climate emergency.

The prize was travelling far enough out into space to look back properly at planet Earth. Those two unforgettable images – Earthrise and Blue Marble – showed us our fragile and precious planet, defined by its blue. Since then, we’ve talked proudly about our “blue planet” but without thinking any further about what that blue actually is. We talk about fish and whales, plastic and pollution – the things that are in the water – but not the water itself. The great ocean engine has just kept turning while we scurry about near its surface, only caring when its churning causes something dramatic that we can see – an algal bloom or a giant swarm of jellyfish. More than 50 years after Apollo, the ocean is starting to get more attention, but a growing slice of the discussion is based on the assumption that it is there for us to use, a resource to be exploited, a great volume of “nothing” that human inventiveness is going to turn into “something”. And this is incredibly dangerous. Unless humanity starts to see the ocean for what it really is – a critical part of our planetary life support system – we risk sleepwalking into destruction. Things are starting to change. The ocean was formally mentioned in the Paris climate agreement of 2015, but it was only in 2019 that an “ocean and climate change dialogue” became part of the UN’s climate COP processes. We’re hearing about the importance of the sea for the Earth’s carbon cycle, and possible changes in ocean circulation due to polar ice melt. But alongside all that, there’s a detectable assumption that the sea is available space to expand into. We’ve filled up the land with our buildings, infrastructure and agriculture, and just look at that vast expanse of water, waiting for humans to give it a purpose! The two most obvious examples of this are schemes to use the ocean to take up more carbon from the atmosphere, and to mine critical minerals from the deep sea. Carbon dioxide removal schemes do not allow us to keep burning fossil fuels – the focus must be on rapid decarbonisation – but they will be necessary in a few decades’ time to reach our current climate goals and maybe even reverse some of the damage. Some of the proposed technologies involve using the sea as a carbon sink, and advocates for scaling them up often give the impression that all this blue is just a giant pond to be exploited, ignoring the fact that the 3D ocean engine is intricately structured and that its living components are already under considerable stress. You can’t “just” fertilise the ocean, or change its alkalinity, or park huge new farms there, or dump billions of tonnes of biomass into the deep sea without affecting the existing ocean physics, chemistry and biology. I have frequently heard engineers and businesspeople state that they have two aims – to restore a pristine ocean and to make the ocean do the clearing up for us by taking up carbon, producing vast quantities of seaweed as a material resource, or whatever this week’s scheme is. That betrays an ignorance of just how intricately woven together the ocean’s systems are, and how interlinked the whole thing is. It is also the language of control dressed up as concern for everyone else’s welfare. Of course, restoring ocean ecosystems is beneficial for lots of reasons, and it will have climate benefits, but we need to focus on the restoration, not manipulating the ocean environment to do stuff for us before we fully understand how it works now. Tracking the long term net effect of these ocean carbon uptake schemes is incredibly difficult, because it’s hard to predict how much carbon they will move from the atmosphere to the ocean and whether it will stay there. We don’t yet have the science (known as “measurement, reporting, and verification”, or MRV) to be sure that any of these interventions in the ocean would work. And it ignores what the sea is already doing for us. Before the industrial era, it was a small source of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, but now it takes in around 25% of all our carbon emissions. That’s 10bn of the 40bn tonnes of CO2 we emit every year. When it comes to removing carbon from the atmosphere, the ocean is already doing us a gigantic favour, and we are still working out whether we will continue to benefit from that favour in the future. *** Back in 1858, the Great Stink of London finally convinced the politicians of the day to find a way to pay for Joseph Bazalgette’s sewer system, as they accepted that the Thames was overwhelmed with human waste, the slop from abattoirs and tanneries, and the general dross of a huge and dirty city. But the language of the time talked of the Thames itself being the problem, rather than recognising that this tidal estuary had been quietly disposing of London’s disgusting mess for centuries. If anything, the Thames was due an enormous thank you for allowing the city to ignore its excesses for so long, and an apology for being biologically ruined in the process. We are guilty of this same attitude with the sea all the time – the assumption that it’s a place called “away”, which makes pollution vanish, and that access to this convenience is a natural right rather than a failing of our own systems. We’ve used the sea as a dump for years – not just for sewage, but for toxic materials, space junk, unwanted munitions and far more – and it’s high time we stopped. Dismissal of the idea that the ocean matters is apparent in a different way with deep-sea mining. There are vast areas of the deep sea floor that are covered with “polymetallic nodules” – potato-sized lumps rich in manganese, nickel, copper and cobalt. The nodules take millions of years to form in this incredibly calm environment. These plains are home to a phenomenal array of strange life that drifts and crawls across the nodules, secure in the darkness and the quiet. The advocates of mining these nodules give their investors the impression that there is nothing there that matters so the mining is consequence-free. But of course that’s not true. These are delicate ecosystems that are difficult to study, and we’re still picking apart the basics. Two things are clear: any mining would generate huge plumes of sediment that would have great effects downstream, and monitoring the mining carefully enough and for long enough to check for the full environmental consequences and compliance with regulations would be extremely hard to do. Society needs to have the debate about the pros and cons of this – maybe the eventual decision will be that it is a necessary trade-off – but you can’t start from the assumption that the ocean isn’t doing anything of value down there already. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t have any ocean infrastructure. Offshore wind is going to be a critically important energy resource, and there may be places where tidal and wave energy generation is the best option. But even these projects should start from the recognition that there is already a physical fluid engine and an ecosystem there, and we should understand that and minimise our influence on it as we stamp our mark on the sea. The ocean of salty water that surrounds our planet has layers, currents, an intricate structure and a very dynamic existence. Life is woven through the physical engine, its locations and abundance dictated by the character of water produced by the swirling, flowing patterns generated by a liquid engine on a spinning planet fed with solar energy. Life in the sea is different from life on land. On land, a tree is our model for the best of the natural world: huge, decades or centuries old, stationary, a reliable feature in a fixed landscape. In the sea, about 60% of the biomass is too small for us to see with the naked eye, and it has rapid, fleeting lives with no long-term storage of resources. These living passengers form the foundation of the ocean food chain, and there is almost as much photosynthesis in the sea as there is on land (although it’s not true that the ocean generates half the oxygen we breathe, because almost all of the oxygen produced in the ocean is consumed in the ocean). The dolphins are lovely, but to think that sea life is all about such charismatic megafauna is to miss the point. It is time to move on from this language and this mindset. What if we could look at the remains of Earth’s last great wilderness and have some humility in how we approach it? The first deep sea explorer, William Beebe, travelled into the depths in a small metal sphere with tiny windows, which he described as “dangling in a hollow pea on a swaying cobweb a quarter of a mile below the deck of a ship rolling in mid-ocean”. He knew his place: a visitor to an alien world, there to look and admire, not to plunder or conquer or modify. We need to shift our view of exploration from drawing maps to understanding processes. And we need to shift our expectations for our activity in the sea from creating our own processes to fitting in with the ones that are already there. Our planet is defined by its ocean, and therefore so are we. We cannot afford to speak of the ocean as though it is simple or empty or worthless. We have to see this dynamic engine as a critical part of our existing planetary life support system, in whose shadow we are privileged to live. Instead of seeing the ocean as a “solution” for climate change, we need to see it as a test of a new attitude to our planet, one that doesn’t treat it as a combination of universal rubbish bin and exploitable resource. Ask not what the ocean can do for you, but what you can do for the ocean. Blue Machine: How the Ocean Shapes Our World by Helen Czerski is published by Torva (£20).

The British journalist and the Brazilian Indigenous expert were shot dead during a reporting trip in the Amazon’s remote Javari valley region a year ago, on 5 June 2022. To mark Monday’s anniversary, events will be held in Brazil’s capital, Brasília, where Pereira once worked for the Indigenous agency, Funai, and on Rio’s Copacabana beach, where Phillips often went paddleboarding while living in the seaside city. Other memorials will be held in Campinas, Salvador and the Amazon city of Belém while activists from EVU, the Indigenous monitoring team Pereira helped create, will travel up the Itaquaí river to erect a towering redwood cross where the two men were killed. “We must never forget what happened in the Javari valley,” the Indigenous leader Beto Marubo said at the premiere of a Brazilian documentary celebrating the victims and the rainforest where they died. Tributes will also be paid in London, where Phillips’s friends and family will demand justice and champion the Indigenous communities he was writing about when he died. “Many people were touched by this tragedy and these events are for people to come together and remember Dom and Bruno, and help deal with their loss,” said the journalist’s sister, Sian Phillips. Phillips hoped the memorials would maximise awareness of the issues her brother spent the final years of his life investigating for an unfinished book called How to Save the Amazon. “It’s about alerting people to those facts, the politics of the Amazon, the dangers for the Indigenous people … these issues are just as relevant today as a year ago, so we have to keep on campaigning,” she said. Clare Handford, a close friend who is helping organise the event at east London’s Rich Mix arts centre, called the tributes “an important symbol of the love and respect for Dom and Bruno which the world now shares with us”. “We refuse to allow them to be forgotten and are determined their deaths will not be in vain,” Handford said, remembering “the panic, the fear and the feeling of utter helplessness” that followed reports of their disappearance last June. A year after the killings – which exposed the Amazon devastation inflicted during Jair Bolsonaro’s four-year presidency – the culprits have yet to be punished. Three local fishers are in high-security prisons while a judge decides if they should face trial by jury. Two have confessed, although they later claimed that they acted in self-defence. A fourth suspect, an alleged mobster who federal police claim ordered the murders, is in custody but has yet to be formally charged. Brazil’s new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has sent security forces to Atalaia do Norte, the isolated river town that is the main entry point into the Javari valley Indigenous territory, as part of a government effort to reduce Amazon destruction. “We will not abandon this struggle for the planet, nor will we forget Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira,” Lula told the Guardian last week. But Javari activists continue to receive death threats, despite nascent government efforts to control the crime-ridden region. “Indigenous people remain under siege in their lands, waiting for answers from a country which closes its eyes to our plight,” Beto Marubo warned in an article for the Guardian as part of The Bruno and Dom Project. Without more emphatic government action, Marubo said other activists and journalists would die on the frontline of a global war on nature and its Indigenous defenders. “There will be other Doms and other Brunos in these trenches – and unfortunately they will lose their lives,” Marubo said, warning that conservative lawmakers were trying to “raffle off” Indigenous territory with controversial legislation stripping back protections.

There was the time, along the Japurá River, that an illegal fisherman threatened to butcher him if he didn’t get out of town. “You’d better leave or we’ll harpoon you,” Damasceno remembers being told. A few years later he narrowly escaped being ambushed and murdered in another remote corner of the rainforest – just as Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips were last year. “It was really, really heavy,” Damasceno says, breaking down as he describes how the failure of his boat’s engine saved him from running into a group of heavily armed assassins who were lying in wait. Damasceno isn’t an Indigenous activist or journalist, like Pereira and Phillips, whose killings exposed the environmental battle raging deep in South America’s rainforests. He is a fishing engineer who has dedicated his life to convincing small riverside communities that sustainable fishing programs will benefit them more than the quick, short-term profits offered by the illegal fishing mafias that pillage the region’s rivers and Indigenous lands. Those efforts to encourage green living have put Damasceno on the wrong side of environmental criminals, yet he insists on fighting on. “I’ve always relied on God to protect me from evil – and here I am carrying on with my mission,” says the softly spoken sustainable fishing evangelist, who recently travelled to the region where Pereira and Phillips were killed hoping to promote sustainable fishing there. The world in which Damasceno operates is one of hidden dangers, cut-throat rules and huge illegal profits, where highly organized gangs of poachers with suspected ties to international drug trafficking groups prey on endangered Amazon species such as the pirarucu. In the wake of last year’s killings, members of Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right government portrayed the crime as the fruit of a local conflict unconnected to the devastation inflicted on the Amazon by his anti-environmental policies and dismantling of Indigenous protections. But the killings exposed a far uglier reality: the rampant and highly lucrative illegal trade in fish and wildlife that plagues Brazil’s isolated and lawless tri-border with Colombia and Peru. At the centre of that trade is Atalaia do Norte, the shabby, poverty-stricken river town where Pereira and Phillips began their final journey on 2 June last year. As the nearest town to the entrance of the Javari valley territory, Brazil’s second largest Indigenous reserve, Atalaia serves as a base for the Indigenous activists on whose work Phillips was reporting when he was killed. Its potholed streets offer an astonishing snapshot of the cultural and linguistic diversity of a region which is home to six Indigenous peoples, including the Matis and the Marubo, as well as 16 groups with little or no contact with the outside world. But in recent years Atalaia has also become a key part of a transnational poaching network with suspected links to the drug factions who move vast quantities of Peruvian cocaine through what police now consider Brazil’s second most important drug smuggling route. After visiting Atalaia last year, congressional investigators concluded that “heavily armed and wealthy criminal associations” and “highly dangerous criminals” had set up camp in the region, bankrolling groups of illegal fishermen who plunder the protected waters and forests of the Indigenous reserve where wildlife is more abundant. “We are certain that illegal fishing in the Javari valley region isn’t about river-dwellers trying to make a living but actually much larger organizations, making sizable investments and outrageous profits,” the investigators wrote. Bruno Pereira’s attempts to fight that illegal trade by organizing Indigenous patrol teams put him on a collision course with such criminals. “It’s because of this that Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira were killed,” a friend and former colleague, Armando Soares, told Forbidden Stories, the Paris-based non-profit coordinating the Bruno and Dom project. Earlier this year police named an alleged local illegal fishing boss as the mastermind behind the crime. The Javari valley’s most prized asset is the arapaima, a giant air-breathing fish which Brazilians call the pirarucu and Peruvians know as paiche. One of the world’s largest freshwater fish, the arapaima can grow up to three metres (10ft) in length and often weighs about 90kg (200lb). It is considered a delicacy in major Latin American cities such as Lima, São Paulo and Bogotá. Years of unregulated overfishing have pummeled arapaima stocks in the waters outside the Javari’s protected Indigenous lands – which outsiders are forbidden from entering without permission and where commercial fishing is banned. As a result poachers have increasingly taken to invading the territory to extract huge boat-fulls of the fish, as well as a river turtle called the tracajá. “They use small boats and travel in small groups,” said Orlando Possuelo, an Indigenous expert who is continuing Pereira’s work with the patrol groups battling to thwart such invaders. “They are specialists in the area. Many of them were born in there [before the territory was officially created in 2001] so it’s not easy to find them.” After being smuggled out of the Indigenous territory in wooden barges packed with ice, the fish are sold in a constellation of border towns including Leticia in Colombia, Islandia in Peru and Benjamin Constant, an edgy river town near Atalaia named after one of the founders of the Brazilian republic. A year-long investigation by Forbidden Stories found that the illegal trade continues to flourish in the tri-border region between Brazil, Colombia and Peru, despite government pledges to stamp out environmental crime following last year’s killings. None of the three countries there have rigid controls over the origin of the arapaima being sold. Brazil has yet to reopen the offices of its environmental agency, Ibama, in Tabatinga, the city nearest to the Javari, after it was shut down in 2019. Peru’s regional production department has no fishing inspectors in Santa Rosa de Yavarí, the Peruvian town across the river from Tabatinga. And Colombian authorities do not control the quantity of fish being caught by the 40 companies registered to operate in Leticia, on the Colombian side of the border. Outside scrutiny is unwelcome. “There’s nothing here. You’re looking to fucking die,” one man warned a reporter from Peru’s OjoPúblico, one of 16 media outlets involved in the Bruno and Dom project, when he visited a riverside fishing warehouse in the Colombian border town looking for illegal fish. Activists say the almost complete lack of controls means the illegal fishing trade continues to thrive despite the international scandal caused by the killings of Pereira and Phillips. “I don’t think anything has changed,” said Possuelo, remembering how Indigenous activists received reports of illegal poachers operating within the Javari territory even in the days after the two men vanished on 5 June last year. Despite the risks, Damasceno said he was determined to continue with his crusade to bring sustainable fishing to some of the most isolated and dangerous corners of the Brazilian Amazon, where he was born and raised. Now 65, the fishing engineer plans to retire after what will be his last – and perhaps most difficult – assignment: implementing such projects in São Rafael, São Gabriel and Ladário, the three fishing communities from which the alleged killers of Pereira and Phillips came. Doing so involves helping those communities set up three different kinds of lakes that will help local pirarucu stocks recover and, hopefully, stop fishermen invading Indigenous lands: “permanent protection lakes” where fishing is forbidden, “maintenance lakes” which local families can fish to feed themselves, and “management lakes” where a quota of up to 30% of adult fish can be legally extracted after their numbers have reached certain levels. “So if there are 100 fish you can take 30, so stocks can recover,” Damasceno said. The fishing engineer argued sustainable fishing was the only way to avoid further violence along the Itaquaí River and help deprived local families resist the temptation of supplying fish for organized crime. As proof that it was possible, he remembered how the fisherman who once threatened to harpoon him had since embraced sustainable fishing and become a close friend. “I always say that sustainable fishing is the way out of this kind of conflict. It unites people. It raises awareness. It opens the door to equality, rights and acceptance,” insisted Damasceno, who hopes to retire to write a book about the pirarucu once his mission is complete. He plans to call it: “The union of people and sustainability in the Amazon.” On a recent trip to the fishing villages near where Pereira and Phillips were killed, Damasceno urged locals to embrace the idea of legal, long-term survival rather than short-term, illegal gain. “Lift up your heads. You must carry on,” he told them. “Think of your kids.” Additional reporting by Ana Ionova (The Guardian), Rodrigo Pedroso (OjoPúblico) and Cécile Andrzejewski and Mariana Abreu (Forbidden Stories)'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9a0', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/03/indigenous-foraging-native-americans-mental-health', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘It healed me’: the Indigenous forager reconnecting Native Americans with their roots', 'lead': 'Twila Cassadore hopes teaching Western Apache traditional foodways can aid mental, emotional and spiritual health', 'author': 'Samuel Gilbert in Bylas, Arizona, on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, with photographs by Gabriela Campos', 'datePublished': '2023-06-03 14:00:32', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563173', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/9b29ac6aac5ede0653772cd9b3486fb61c60ef6b/0_75_3000_1801/500.jpg', 'body': 'On a warm day in April, Twila Cassadore piloted her pickup truck toward the mountains on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona to scout for wild edible plants. A wet winter and spring rains had transformed the desert into a sea of color: green creosote bushes topped with small yellow flowers, white mariposa lilies, purple lupines and poppies in full bloom. Cassadore and I drove up a rough dirt road that used to be an old cattle trail, passing through various ecosystems, moving from Sonoran desert to grasslands and piñon-juniper woodlands. In each area, Cassadore would stop to gather desert chia seeds, cacti flowers and thistles. Cassadore stopped her truck beside a three-leafed sumac bush brimming with fruit. “If you suck on them, they taste like sour lemonade,” she said, removing the fuzzy, white unripened berries from the bush. Cassadore will make a slushy when they are ripe by blending the berries with wood sorrel and ice. “Better for you than Kool-Aid,” she said. As a forager and celebrated food educator, Cassadore, 56, has spent the past 30 years documenting and teaching her fellow Western Apache people about the importance of wild foods in a region that’s considered one of the most biodiverse in the US – yet where diet and substance abuse are leading causes of death. Working closely with the tribe’s wellness center, the local high school and recovery groups, she often takes people out into the land to forage, cook and heal. *** Foraged food accounted for up to 50% of the Western Apache diet in pre-reservation times. In spring, it’s onions, potatoes, miner’s lettuce and thistles. In summer, it’s cacti fruit, berries and acorns – “the most prized food in our community”, Cassadore said. But after being forced on to reservations, the Apache were forbidden to gather their traditional foods and became dependent on rations and later, commodities. By the time Cassadore was growing up on the 1.8m-acre reservation, she said that many people looked down on foraged food, or associated it with poverty. So she was often teased by her elementary school classmates for bringing homemade beef jerky, acorns, pine nuts and dried mesquite pods foraged by her and her family, instead of the candy bars and sodas that everyone else had. Today the White River, San Carlos and Fort Apache reservations are considered food deserts with few grocery stores and limited access to fresh, healthy foods. “When you go to school with foraged food, you almost got bullied,” she said. “That was traumatizing for me, and I was embarrassed to bring food from my own home. To me, eating foraged food, this was normal. I didn’t know Lucky Charms existed.” Cassadore later struggled with drug addiction and mental health issues for much of her life, but said that foraging provided her a way out. It allowed her to reconnect to her “identity, culture and people”, she said. She spent years learning about traditional foodways, gaining the trust of community elders, listening to their stories, and harvesting the foods of her ancestors. This gave her purpose and “filled this void I had felt most of my life”, said Cassadore, who is now more than 20 years sober. “Foraging healed me.” Through her work, Cassadore now helps others struggling with addiction, depression and other mental health issues. “They come back with a connection of who they are, as an Apache person,” said Cassadore, recalling leading a traditional gloscho (desert woodrat) hunt with patients from a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. “It wakes up something inside of people. It calms them and makes them want to get better.” Naelyn Pike spent the summer after graduating high school working with Cassadore through the Traditional Western Apache Diet Project, a program to document and study traditional Ndee/Nnee (Western Apache) knowledge of the natural world and highlight the benefits of pre-reservation life and foods. Pike and other Apache youth spent days in the field with Cassadore, the organization’s project assistant, learning about Apache foods, recipes and traditions. “It left a huge mark on my life,” said 23-year-old Pike, an Indigenous rights activist and executive assistant to the office of the chairman for the San Carlos Apache Tribe. “It teaches us the importance of our way of life as Apache people.” Like many of her peers, Pike has re-embraced foraging since her time with Cassadore, spending time each summer harvesting acorns, saguaro fruit and other wild foods. “I am very confident that when we go back to Apache foods, it doesn’t just benefit us physically, but mentally, emotionally and spiritually,” she said. “Taking part in this project has opened my eyes to understanding traditional values and how important our food is. We want to reclaim, preserve and grasp on to this way of life.” Tribal officials told the Guardian that people on the San Carlos Apache Reservation are facing interconnected epidemics of substance abuse, suicide and sexual violence – and the threat of ecological collapse. “For traditional people, these are all completely related,” said one tribal official who asked not to be named. “There are all kinds of historical reasons for people not living a balanced way of life. People like Twila are working really hard to bring the community back into this balance.” *** Cassadore favors particular plants at specific locations and elevations. “I can’t remember where a restaurant is, but I can remember exactly where a plant is,” she said. Her favorite patch of prickly pear is at the base of a cliff band below a series of Anasazi cave ruins. Cassadore will make fruit leather and a vibrant purple-colored prickly pear sugar – “messy but delicious”. Cassadore is often scouting for the future. The banana yucca fruit won’t be ripe until October. However, the development of the flowers in spring will determine the plant’s fruit production. “A big patch like this is the best place to harvest,” she said of a large concentration of blooming banana yuccas whose white flowers resemble squash blossoms. When roasted, the fruit is “apple-sauce sweet”. She plans to return here in the fall to teach people from the community how to gather and prepare the fruit. Along with foraging, Cassadore has interviewed more than 100 elders to help identify more than 200 wild edible plants and hundreds of traditional recipes, like acorn soup and agave pie with crust made from foraged seeds.

But now giant clumps of the 13m-ton morass labeled the Great Atlantic sargassum belt are washing up on Florida’s beaches, scientists are warning of a real-life threat from the piles of decomposing algae, namely high levels of the flesh-eating Vibrio bacteria lurking in the vegetation. The alarming discovery by marine biologists at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) lends a dangerous new aspect to the brown seaweed onslaught, which is already threatening to spoil the state’s busy summer tourism season as coatings of decaying goop exude a pungent aroma akin to that of rotting eggs. Even more worrying, the researchers say, is the role of ocean pollution in the proliferation of the bacteria, which can cause disease and death if a person gets infected. Samples tested from the Caribbean and Sargasso Sea within the Atlantic were abundant with plastic debris, which interacted with the algae and bacteria to create a “perfect pathogen storm [with] implications for both marine life and public health”. “Our lab work showed that these Vibrio are extremely aggressive and can seek out and stick to plastic within minutes,” said Tracy Mincer, assistant professor of biology at FAU’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute and Harriet L Wilkes Honors College. He said the seaweed belt stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the African coast provided the perfect breeding ground for “omnivorous” strains of the bacteria that target both plant and animal life, and associated “microbial flora” potentially harboring potent levels of pathogens. “We really want to make the public aware of these associated risks. In particular, caution should be exercised regarding the harvest and processing of sargassum biomass until the risks are explored more thoroughly,” he said. That’s become a worry for many, from municipal crews charged with clearing the washed-up seaweed from Florida’s beaches to make them more attractive for vacationers, to the tourists themselves and teams of environmentally conscious volunteers who fill trash sacks with washed up detritus. “It’s very alarming in the first place to see it on the beaches, and alarming to see all the plastic that is entangled in it. And now even more than that, there’s harmful bacteria too. That’s so scary,” said Sophie Ringel, founder of the non-profit Clean Miami Beach. The group is hosting a beach cleanup on Saturday to mark next week’s World Ocean Day, and recruits will be taking precautions including thick gloves, sanitizers and long-handled grabbers to avoid direct contact with the materials they remove. “We’ll be paying extra attention and making sure everybody washes their hands, and doesn’t touch their faces after the cleanup. But I wonder what happens if we ingest it or come in contact with it? Is it transferable? And when it rains, does it end up in our drinking water?” Ringel said. Florida’s department of health is advising residents and visitors to avoid sargassum and warns that Vibrio vulnificus infections “can be severe for people who have weakened immune systems, such as those with chronic liver disease”. The state’s department of environmental protection (DEP), meanwhile, says it’s working with the Florida fish and wildlife commission and municipalities to monitor the seaweed belt, and notes that the Florida legislature has budgeted $5m to assist local governments with cleanup efforts. “This is not a new phenomenon and many local governments, particularly in south Florida, are experienced in managing it on their beaches and already have management plans and the necessary authorizations in place to respond,” a DEP spokesperson, Jon Moore, told the Guardian. “We’re ready to work with any impacted local government … as well as expedite necessary authorizations so that cleanup activities can be conducted in an efficient and protective manner.” Crews with heavy machinery remove sargassum from 15 miles of shoreline on Miami Beach, and two more on Key Biscayne, early most mornings, after surveyors check for turtle nests, Tom Morgan, chief of operations for Miami-Dade county’s parks, recreation and open spaces, said. It ensures the beaches of the popular tourist destination remain clean and attractive, and helps to remove the threat of infection, or respiratory distress from hydrogen sulfide, the source of the “rotten eggs” smell that comes from rotting algae. “We’re aware of the report, and our beach maintenance crews are instructed to wear gloves if they’re removing anything from the water’s edge and the sargassum related to plastics, or any other type of debris, pieces of wood or anything like that,” he said. “That’s to protect them while they’re working, and that’s been standard practice even before this report came about.” Beaches were packed with visitors over the Memorial Day weekend, and Michael Zimmer, director of marketing and development for Miami-Dade parks, said tourism was “so far so good”. “We get pictures every morning and afternoon and I gotta tell you, the beaches look really good,” he said. “The team does an incredible job cleaning it up every morning and we just haven’t seen any effects on tourism yet.” The county expects to spend about $6m on seaweed removal this year, but pulling sargassum from the sea before it washes ashore is neither legal nor desirable. It’s a crucial habitat for crabs, shrimps and other marine invertebrates, which in turn provide a rich floating “buffet” for seabirds including gulls, terns and plovers. Unfortunately, the toxicity of the sargassum belt can simultaneously be harmful. “The amount of plastic we find entangled in the seaweed on a daily basis, and every tide that comes in brings more, is shocking. And the animals out in the ocean who live on it, they try to get nutrition from it and automatically ingest the plastic,” Ringel said. “They just can’t help it. It’s so, so sad.” One bright spot is that scientists at the University of South Florida (USF), who have tracked the sargassum using satellite imaging, say the amount in the Atlantic unexpectedly decreased by about 15% in May, and is forecast to drop in the Gulf of Mexico this month. “[That] is good news for many coastal residents of Florida,” the university’s optical oceanography laboratory said on its website. Overall, though, the researchers have recorded huge increases in sargassum over the last decade, and expect it to continue. “The plausible theory was that in 2010 there was a long distance transport from the Sargasso sea to the tropical Atlantic. That was an usual event,” said Chuanmin Hu, professor of optical oceanography at USF. “The tropical Atlantic has a lot more seed populations of sargassum, and warm water, and sunshine, enough nutrients … all the conditions are favorable for sargassum to grow.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9a2', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/03/iraqs-oil-boom-blamed-for-worsening-water-crisis-in-drought-hit-south', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Iraq’s oil boom blamed for worsening water crisis in drought-hit south ', 'lead': 'Pollution from gas flaring – the burning of natural gas associated with oil extraction – is also a major concern in the oil-rich but extremely dry south', 'author': 'Sara Manisera and Daniela Sala in Al Khora', 'datePublished': '2023-06-03 05:00:22', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563212', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/36a138ad434249d352330ce17c61c12871c125a8/0_338_6720_4032/500.jpg', 'body': 'Western oil companies are exacerbating water shortages and causing pollution in Iraq as they race to profit from rising oil prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Water scarcity has already displaced thousands and increased instability, according to international experts, while Iraq is now considered the fifth most vulnerable country to the climate crisis by the UN. In the oil-rich but extremely dry south, wetlands that used to feed entire communities are now muddy canals. Mahdi Mutir, 57, worked as a fisher his entire life. For years, Mutir and his wife woke at dusk, sailing along a thick network of canals in Al Khora, a few kilometres north of Basra. The harvest was meagre but enough to provide food for the family of seven. That changed last year. Now, at the height of the rainy season, Mutir’s boat lies stranded in the mud. “It is the water station the Italian company built: they need water for their oilfields,” Mutir said, pointing at the black smoke rising from the Zubayr oilfield on the horizon. To help extract oil, companies pump large quantities of water into the ground. For each barrel of oil, many of which are later exported to Europe, up to three barrels of water are pumped into the ground. And as Iraq’s oil exports rise, its water has dramatically fallen. The Italian company Mutir is referring to is the oil and gas multinational Eni, which has been working in Iraq since 2009. Analysis of satellite images shows how over the past year a small dam, built by Eni to divert water from the Basra canal to its water treatment plant is preventing the seasonal flooding of the area where Mutir once used to fish. Another nearby plant used by oil companies including BP and ExxonMobil accounts for 25% of the daily water consumption in a region of almost 5 million people. The Qarmat Ali plant, five miles south of the Eni plant, is operated by the Rumaila Operating Organisation (ROO), comprised of BP, PetroChina and the South Oil Company of Iraq. Water at the plant comes directly from the Abd Abdullah canal, which redirects freshwater from a river before it reaches the Shatt al-Arab, the river formed by the confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, and Basra’s main water source. In a statement Eni said no fresh water was used by the company as the water from the canals is salty and polluted, and therefore it is not in competition with other uses. But the Guardian has seen on the ground and in satellite images how the water from the canals feeding Qarmat Ali and Eni’s under-construction Al Khora plant merges a few kilometres south of the two plants into a public water treatment plant that provides 35% of the water used by households in Basra. Iraq’s impending water crisis has been well documented. In 2012, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that the country’s water needs for oil would increase tenfold. Without alternatives, it said, “water would have to come from local aquifers, which would compete directly with the needs for agriculture and consumption”. Despite the warnings, little has been done. In 2018, an acute water crisis in the city resulted in 118,000 people being taken to hospital and led to violent protests. Demonstrators threw petrol bombs at government buildings and the security forces allegedly responded with live ammunition, leaving at least five people dead. “Overall the volume of water injections required is not huge, but in water-stressed areas this can cause serious problems,” said Robert Mills, the chief executive of Qamar Energy, an independent consultancy, and author of a 2018 report on Iraq’s water injection needs. “In Basra, which has terrible water problems, in principle oil companies should find alternatives to fresh water” he said. Alternatives exist. In Saudi Arabia, Iraq’s neighbour with comparable water problems and the world’s third largest oil reserve, water for injection is taken from the sea. In Iraq, discussions over the construction of a project to supply seawater have been taking place for more than a decade, but nothing has been done yet: “The ministry of oil does not have enough budget, and oil companies do not want to pay for it,” Mills said. Iraq more than doubled its crude production in the decade leading up to 2019, and its output has only grown since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. That year, exports of Iraqi oil to Europe rose by nearly 40%. Last year, oil and gas companies recorded unprecedented profits. Eni doubled its 2021 results, netting £17.9bn, while BP, Exxon and TotalEnergies also recorded their most profitable years in recent history. Iraq, however, has not seen a similar growth. “Iraq’s development indices resemble that of low-income countries,” the World Bank said in a 2022 report. “Contrary to other countries they operate in, in Iraq most foreign oil companies do nothing to limit their environmental impact: for them it is just cheaper to keep polluting the environment,” said Walid al-Hamid, head of southern Iraq’s environmental agency. The department oversees inspections of oilfields and imposes sanctions for environmental damage. In a document seen by the Guardian, Eni and BP are among the companies listed as having been fined. But many of the fines, according to Hamid, have never been paid. Gas flaring – the burning of natural gas associated with oil extraction – is also a serious concern. In 2018, the gas flared within a 70km radius of Basra exceeded the total flaring volume of Saudi Arabia, China, Canada, and India combined. In Zubair alone last year 2.5bn cubic metres of gas were burned, World Bank data shows, despite Eni’s claim in its 2021 annual report that the company was responsible for less than half that figure worldwide. Eni said in a statement that although it leads the consortium of companies that operates the Zubair field, it is not the operator and does “not have control of the strategy for the field, or the responsibility for flaring … all of which sit with the Basra Oil Company [the national Iraqi company responsible for the oil in the south of the country].” Eni also said that it is not responsible for the fines levied by the environment agency, and that they should be paid by the Basra Oil Company, which operates the field in question. The terms of the contract, the company added, “explicitly removes any responsibility for flaring, flaring reduction projects or community compensation”. BP said it was also not responsible for the fines listed in the documents, and that the field in question was operated by the Rumaila Operating Organisation, a company it founded and in which it holds a 47.6% share.

There were already quite a few trees in this patch – mainly oak, sycamore and rowan – but the livestock exclusion has allowed some to self-seed and regenerate. One of the rowans is now taller than me. The farmhouse looks out over part of the strip, and we can hear a variety of birdsong coming from it. The gamechanger for recording what species are living there has been the Merlin bird ID app. I downloaded it last week and since then have been making recordings as I do my work on the farm. This morning I recorded the birdsong as I walked across the field to let the hens out. I recognised the cuckoo and robin, but there were other songs I didn’t know. The app told me they were greenfinch, spotted flycatcher and hawfinch. I did another recording to make sure – the same species came up again. Across the day it picked up calls by willow warbler, blackcap, song thrush, peregrine, snipe, short-eared owl … All the while I’ve been trying to get my “ear in”, and can now recognise a wren, having heard it so many times this week. I Googled the species and was amazed to find that many of them are red-listed birds, meaning they are of the highest conservation concern in the UK. I knew that the tree sparrows that inhabit our barn are red-listed – a visiting national park authority natural environment adviser told me – but I had no idea there were so many others. I imagine the app isn’t right every time, but it is making my summer mornings doing farm work more interesting, and it’s heartening to know that, with our wilded strip, we’re doing our bit. The cows are now out of the barns where they have been living for the winter, lying in the sun and enjoying the warm weather as much as we are. Every couple of days we move them to fresh grass. It is hot so we all walk slowly, oystercatchers peeping overhead. That’s one bird call I don’t need the app for – it’s the sound of summer here. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9a4', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/dupont-pfas-settlement-water-chemical-contamination', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Top US chemical firms to pay $1.2bn to settle water contamination lawsuits', 'lead': 'Dupont, Chemours and Corteva agree deal and 3M also reportedly considering $10bn settlement to avoid trial due to start on Monday', 'author': 'Carey Gillam and Shannon Kelleher', 'datePublished': '2023-06-02 20:00:51', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563248', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/b873031a32410c2f038bc93b7f0588078c2b5d6d/0_126_3844_2306/500.jpg', 'body': 'DuPont and two related companies said they would pay close to $1.2bn to settle liability claims brought by public water systems serving the vast majority of the US population on Friday, just days before the start of a bellwether trial in South Carolina over PFAS contamination. PFAS maker 3M was reportedly also considering a settlement that would keep the company from having to face allegations that it was responsible for knowingly contaminating drinking water supplies around the United States. The trial set to start on Monday is expected to shine a light on long-held secret documents about the chemical giant 3M’s knowledge of the dangers of its per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). 3M has previously announced it will exit PFAS production by 2025. DuPont and its related companies were recently severed from the case, as they negotiated the settlement in which DuPont will pay roughly $400m ; Chemours, a DuPont spinoff, will pay $592m; and another DuPont-related company, Corteva, will pay about $193m. The companies said the settlement excludes personal injury claims due to alleged exposure to PFAS, as well as claims by state attorneys general about PFAS contamination of natural resources. Bloomberg reported on Friday that 3M was negotiating a $10bn payout that would resolve claims and avoid Monday’s trial. Asked about a potential settlement, 3M said in a statement: “We don’t comment on rumors and speculation.” 3M said earlier in a court filing that it was not liable and that it “never owned, operated, or otherwise controlled the facilities, disposal sites, and other purported sources of PFAS or related compounds”. The company lacked the “necessary controls over its products after the point of sale”, it said in the filing. The company said in a statement that it was working to stop the use of PFAS across its product portfolio by the end of 2025, even though “PFAS are safely made and used in many modern products”. 4,000 other plaintiffs The plaintiff in the trial scheduled to start on Monday is the small city of Stuart, Florida, which is suing over the contamination of its drinking water with two types of PFAS called PFOS and PFOA that were used in firefighting foam by local firefighters. More than 4,000 other plaintiffs are also part of the broader litigation being overseen by the US district court in Charleston, South Carolina. The multi-district litigation (MDL) aims to recover the expenses public and private water utilities are incurring to test, monitor and replace water supplies and to install equipment to try to clear the chemicals from tainted systems. Stuart, a city of about 17,000 people on Florida’s Atlantic coast, discovered its drinking water wells had been contaminated in 2016 when state regulators informed city officials that some of its well water contained levels of PFOA and PFOS higher than what the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers safe. Ultimately, nearly all of the city’s wells were found to contain some level of PFOA or PFOS. The city traced the contamination back to “aqueous film-forming foams” (AFFF) the local fire department had used in training exercises for decades, unaware that the work to protect public safety was instead potentially putting it at risk due to the dangerous chemicals in the foam. The city has since installed an ion exchange filtration system that is designed to reduce the levels of PFOS and PFOA to undetectable levels, said Michael Mortell, Stuart city attorney and interim city manager. The city wants 3M – not the taxpayer – to shoulder the expense. The city is also seeking punitive damages for 3M’s alleged “wrongful conduct”. The Stuart case, like the thousands of others pending, alleges that 3M knew by the 1970s that PFOA and PFOS could endanger human health and the environment, but decided to hide the knowledge from the public and regulators, and continued to manufacture the chemicals, including for use in the firefighting foam. Attorneys for Stuart are planning to build their case in part on 3M’s own internal records, many of which were made public after Minnesota officials negotiated an $850m settlement with 3M in 2018 over PFAS water contamination the state alleged caused cancers and other health problems in residents. “They knew that their chemical … was in the blood of the general population: every man, woman and child,” said McWilliams, one of Stuart city’s lawyers, summarizing a position the city plans to make in court. “They deliberated whether or not to tell the EPA. They ultimately decided not to. And then they sat on it for 22 years.” Even after the EPA pressured 3M to stop making PFAS chemicals used in firefighting foam in 2002, the company allegedly failed to warn users and the public about harmful foam that remained on the market or to recall the harmful products. PFAS, sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, have been used in an extensive array of consumer and industrial applications due to their resistance to water, oil and heat, and are present in everything from pizza boxes and pesticides to plastics and paints. The EPA says PFAS residues persist in water, soil, air and food, as well as common materials in homes and workplaces. Scientists have additionally determined that the toxins are now commonly found in the bodies of people and animals worldwide. An estimated 97% of Americans have PFAS in their blood, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “Next to global warming, this is the biggest environmental catastrophe to ever happen,” said Ned McWilliams, one of the lawyers representing the Florida town in the upcoming trial. A collection of some of 3M and DuPont’s internal files dating back to the 1960s are expected to be introduced as evidence, according to plaintiffs’ attorneys. Testimony from retired 3M toxicologist John Butenhoff is also expected to be presented in the trial. In a video deposition taken before the trial, Butenhoff acknowledged that 3M is more than likely the source for PFOS contamination around the globe, including in air, waters, soil, humans, fish, polar bears and “other Arctic mammals”. “More likely than not the source is 3M,” Butenhoff states in his testimony.

Lab experiments in which the flies were chilled gradually to sub-zero temperatures revealed they can detach one or more of their six legs, an apparent “last-ditch tactic” to protect their internal organs from the advancing cold. “It is gruesome,” said John Tuthill at the University of Washington. “This wave of ice is going to crash into their bodies and kill them so they’re doing this amputation to prevent that happening.” About 20% of snow flies collected in the wild by the researchers were already missing legs, he added. Snow flies, being crane flies, are from the same family as daddy long legs. Unlike the well known British insect, North American snow flies habitually walk across snow and ice in the wild and have been observed doing so at temperatures as low as -10C. The researchers used dozens of snow flies from four different but closely related species collected from icy, mountainous habitats in Washington state, Colorado and Vermont in the US, and British Columbia and Yukon in Canada. In their experiments, the team placed individual flies on laboratory cold plates and observed their behaviour with a thermal imaging camera as the temperature slowly dropped. The flies could still walk even when their bodies reached -7C, and the thermal imaging camera was able to capture the precise moment at which the flies’ legs began to freeze, prompting the amputation response. This happened in 31% of cases where freezing began in a leg. Some flies removed as many as five legs before succumbing to the cold. The team has published a paper online detailing their findings, though it is yet to be peer-reviewed. Other crane flies are known to self-amputate their legs – but for different reasons. They tend to do it when a predator grabs on to one of their limbs. According to Tuthill, there are muscles inside the flies’ legs that seemingly allow them to pinch off or detach a limb at will. Certain geckos, crayfish and squid can also self-amputate their limbs or tails to escape predators. The African spiny mouse can even shed huge quantities of its own skin in a tight spot. However, leg self-amputation as a response to potentially freezing to death was described as “unique” by the researchers. “It’s an extreme adaptation,” said Erica McAlister, the curator of flies and fleas at the Natural History Museum, while praising the research. In their paper, Tuthill and colleagues speculated that the flies may be able to detect a slight rise in temperature inside their legs, which is – somewhat counterintuitively – caused by a release of energy when ice crystals form. Researchers plan to investigate this hypothesis in future experiments, Tuthill said. McAlister noted that the hardy flies have an evolutionary advantage in being able to survive, much of the time, in spite of the snow and ice. But that may evaporate as mountainous areas lose their snow cover due to global heating. “When the snow disappears and this selective advantage of them being able to peg it out of the situation goes, you’re going to have a deleterious effect,” she said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9a6', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/mining-cattle-ranching-soya-farming-corporations-dominate-amazon', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'A look at some of the corporations that dominate the Amazon', 'lead': 'From mining to cattle ranching and soya farming, some of the world’s largest companies exploit the region, though many also claim to be giving something back', 'author': 'Bibi van der Zee, Patrick Greenfield and Jonathan Watts', 'datePublished': '2023-06-02 12:17:23', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563286', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b4f3bc1aa4f3077b8f9b8346a837c056bebe25/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg', 'body': 'Vale CEO: Eduardo Bartolomeo Main business: Mining – iron, copper, nickel.

According to Mongabay, “more than 10 years on, Alcoa has reformed its corporate image and ways, earning an enviable collection of sustainability certificates along with a reputation for dialogue with local communities.” Alcoa’s Gênesis Costa told the publication: “We’ve invested 73m Brazilian reals [$14m] in Juruti in installations like the hospital, which seems set to become an [example] for the region.” MRN CEO: Guido Germani Main business: Mining – bauxite Ownership: Joint venture between Rio Tinto, Alcoa, Norsk Hydro, Vale HQ: Porto Trombetas, Pará, Brazil Major operations in the Amazon: The Oriximiná and Terra Santa mines in Pará, which produce bauxite ore. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Scientific report in 2017 linked MRN to deforestation. A Christian Aid report in 2022 alleged that MRN’s mining operations in Oriximiná had “caused the deforestation of extensive areas of tropical forest” and “polluted watercourses”, and argued that tax exemptions given to the company “cut directly into the budgets of the state and municipalities tasked with providing public services and investing in sustainable development”. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Company has rehabilitated Lake Batatain Oriximiná, and helped establish the Saraca-Taaquera national forest and Trombetas biological reserve to prevent further forest loss and environmental degradation. Has reforested 7,500ha, and invested more than $4m in social environmental projects. Norsk Hydro CEO: Hilde Merete Aasheim Main business: Mining – aluminium Ownership: Shareholders HQ: Oslo, Norway Major operations in the Amazon: Owns four companies in Pará: Mineração Paragominas, which explores for bauxite in the Paragominas region; the Alunorte alumina refinery; the Albras aluminium factory and the Companhia de Alumina do Pará, all three in the Barcarena area. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Linked to water contamination in 2018 after heavy rainfall led to local flooding but stated that other factors had been responsible. A Dutch court ruled in 2022 that a case against the company related to the events could proceed. The company strongly disputes the allegations. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Has developed new techniques that safeguard communities and the environment. The $100m Hydro sustainability fund supports community investments. A rehabilitation programme is being operated around the Paragominas mine with the support of local universities. Since the 2018 storm, it has been building stronger links with local communities. JBS CEO: Gilberto Xandó Main business: The world’s largest meat-processing company Ownership: Shareholders HQ: São Paulo, Brazil Major operations in the Amazon: Owns multiple abattoirs in the Amazon and sources livestock directly and indirectly from hundreds of farms throughout the forest. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked to deforestation. A report by Global Witness in 2022 highlighted failures by JBS, Marfrig and Minerva Foods to monitor their supply chain properly, and also raised issues with the auditors. In 2018 Norway’s state pension fund divested from the company over these concerns. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: In 2020 the company pledged to build the Green Platform, which would allow it to monitor all suppliers by 2025. Runs the JBS Amazon Fund, backing initiatives to promote sustainable social and economic development in the Amazon. In 2021 promised to publish a net-zero action plan, with targets consistent with the criteria of the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), a partnership between CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), the UN Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Marfrig Chairman: Marcos Antonio Molina dos Santos Main business: Processing meat Ownership: Shareholders HQ: São Paulo, Brazil Major operations in the Amazon: Owns abattoirs and sources directly and indirectly from multiple farmers. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked to deforestation. Discussions over a $200m loan from the Inter-American Development Bank – tied to environmental targets – were broken off because, according to the IDB, conditions were “not ideal”. Marfrig said the talks were ended mutually due to a disagreement over “financial conditions” and methodologies. In December 2021 the Norwegian state pension fund placed Marfrig under observation “due to risk that the company contributes to serious environmental damage”. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Took the industry lead with the Marfrig Verde + pledge in 2020 to have full traceability of its Amazon cattle by 2025. Marfrig created a risk-mitigation map for the Amazon and other Brazilian biomes, for direct and indirect suppliers, to identify the areas most exposed to deforestation and social conflicts. The company says it now monitors 100% of direct suppliers, while for indirect suppliers, traceability rates have reach 80% in the Amazon biome and 74% in the Cerrado biome. Minerva Foods CEO: Fernando Galletti Main business: Beef producer and exporter, also in processed foods Ownership: Shareholders HQ: Barretos, Brazil Major operations in the Amazon: Owns numerous abattoirs and sources from farmers. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked in the past to deforestation. The company says that it uses the best-available technology in its traceability practices to ensure compliance with environmental, labour and land tenure regulations within its portfolio of producers. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Minerva is the only company to monitor all of its direct supplier farms, according to its reports. Pioneered the wider application of geospatial monitoring technology, tracks the condition of ranches, ensuring that cattle bought by Minerva do not originate from illegally deforested ranches; or possess environmental embargos (punitive measures imposed by inspectors to stop activities that degrade the environment). Is working with suppliers to get them into its low-carbon emission “Renove” programme. Brasil Biofuels CEO: Milton Steagall Main business: Agribusiness, biofuels and renewable energy Ownership: Privately owned HQ: São João da Baliza, Roraima, Brazil Major operations in the Amazon: Sustainable cultivation of palm oil, biotechnology lab, biodiesel plant, renewable energy thermoelectric plants, and biorefinery under construction to produce hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) biofuels. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Biopalma, bought by BBF in 2020, was the subject of a federal investigation into the impact of pesticide contamination from the plantations. A police investigation cleared the company. BBF was also accused of violence and intimidation by a neighbouring community. The company counters that in fact they have been the victims of theft and assault and state that good relationships with local communities are a vital part of their working philosophy. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: The BBF Group sees its mission as “decarbonising the Amazon forest and changing the energy matrix of the northern region of Brazil”. Developing a sustainable model for producing palm oil is one of the prime goals. According to the company, under the strict Brazilian palm-oil regulatory system, plantations can only be on land previously defined as degraded. More than 6,000 jobs created in the Amazon. The company estimates that more than 25m tons of carbon have been stored by the 11m trees it has planted. The biofuels produced by the company and used by Amazon residents lead to a significant amount of avoided emissions. The company says its biofuel-powered thermoelectric plants produce clean energy for remote Amazon communities. Also supports local communities with transport and technological projects. Agropalma CEO: Beny Fiterman Main business: Biofuels Ownership: Part of Alfa Group, privately held HQ: Belem, Pará Major operations in the Amazon: Plantations, extraction plant and refinery in Pará. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Faced allegations of landgrabbing. The company says all their land was acquired in good faith but is continuing to look into possible issues predating their purchase. Subsequently, the IBD certification of their plantations has been temporarily suspended. The company says it remains a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, which runs the certification process, and expects to have the suspension lifted soon. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: The company says it is committed to zero deforestation: since 2002, the company no longer converts forests into palm plantations. Primary responsibility for a 64,000ha Amazon forest reserve. Has pioneered palm oil family farming and is committed to providing formal employment for families to help them into guaranteed and sustainable work. Runs a school for 500 children. Partnered for 15 years with Conservation International to develop a sustainable production model that has registered 1,029 species of Brazilian fauna in Agropalma’s forest reserves. Suzano CEO: Walter Schalka Main business: Eucalyptus pulp Ownership: Shareholders HQ: São Paulo, Brazil Major operations in the Amazon: The Suzano factory in Imperatriz, Maranhão, lies on the border between the Cerrado, a large area of tropical savanna, and the Amazon, and sources from both biomes. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? “Coconut breakers” – women who harvest coconuts – complain that Suzano’s expansion is displacing the palms they depend on; the company denies this. Eucalyptus production is also water intensive, and local populations have complained that river levels are affected. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Suzano has a regenerative business model, planting more than 1.2m trees every day in degraded land, only harvesting what it plants, with 40% of its land (nearly 1m hectares) set aside for permanent conservation. Eucalyptus plantations are being seen as a way of achieving reforestation and carbon capture goals, supported by the regional government, which has announced that it will use eucalyptus to help replace some of its lost forests. The plantations can help solve the climate crisis, the company says. In 2022, Suzano began a project to connect 500,000ha of priority conservation areas through biodiversity corridors, and also announced the launch of a new forest restoration venture to restore and conserve 40,000 sq km of Brazilian forest, which will involve planting 2m trees of native species. Runs a number of social programmes with local communities. Cargill CEO: Brian Sikes Main business: Commodity traders Ownership: Largest privately owned US company HQ: Wayzata, Minnesota Major operations in the Amazon: Cargill buys from a number of plantations in the Amazon. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked to deforestation in the Amazon and the neighbouring Cerrado. Named as the “world’s worst company” by Mighty Earth in 2019. In the report’s foreword, the former US congressman Henry Waxman wrote of their exchanges with the company: “We’ve successfully worked to improve the environmental and human rights practices of dozens of companies, but have never encountered a company that has such difficulty translating high-level commitments into action.” The environmental law charity ClientEarth has now filed a legal complaint against Cargill over its failure to adequately deal with its contribution to soya-driven deforestation and human rights violations in Brazil. The company says it has “an unwavering commitment” to eliminate deforestation in Brazil. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: One of the original signatories to the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM). Supported the Coalizão Brasil, which pleaded with Brazil’s far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, not to leave the Paris climate agreement or dismantle the environment ministry. Has accelerated its commitment to eliminate deforestation in its soya supply chain in the Amazon, Cerrado and Chaco biomes by 2025. Is investing in programmes and training to help farmers, increased technology to improve traceability, and investments in teams in Brazil and throughout South America in order to accelerate deforestation efforts. Committed $30m to launch the Land Innovation Fund for Sustainable Livelihoods, which funds projects that empower farmers and protects forests across South America. Bunge CEO: Greg Heckman Main business: Agribusiness Ownership: Shareholders HQ: St Louis, Missouri Major operations in the Amazon: Bunge buys from a number of plantations in the Amazon. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked to deforestation in the Amazon. Company is working to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains and announced last year that it was beating its own targets. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Signatory to the Soy moratorium since 2006. In 2021, 98% of Bunge shareholders backed a proposal to reduce deforestation, with the support of the directors. ADM (Archer Daniels Midland) CEO: Juan Ricardo Luciano Main business: Commodity traders Ownership: Shareholders HQ: Chicago Major operations in the Amazon: Buys from a number of farms. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Has been linked to deforestation. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Pledged to achieve 100% deforestation-free supply chains by 2025. Member of the Round Table on Responsible Soy Association. Louis Dreyfus CEO: Michael Gelchie Main business: Commodity traders Ownership: Shareholders HQ: Rotterdam, the Netherlands Major operations in the Amazon: Louis Dreyfus buys from a number of plantations in the Amazon. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues and human rights conflicts? Linked to deforestation. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: Supports the extension of the ASM, and the first major soya company to announce a policy to eliminate the destruction of native ecosystems and endangered wildlife from its soya supply chain. Amaggi CEO: Judiney Carvalho de Souza Main business: Soya beans Ownership: Privately owned HQ: Cuiabá, Brazil Major operations in the Amazon: Amaggi buys from a number of plantations in the Amazon. Largest of the Brazilian soya traders. Any links to deforestation, environmental issues, and human rights conflicts? Supply-chain analysts Trase calculate that Amaggi has been exposed to deforestation risk. Ways it gives back to the Amazon: The only global soya production and trading company to get an “A” rating for tackling deforestation from CDP in 2021. Given 9/10 for its approach to tackling deforestation by Global Canopy’s Forest 500 rankings. Member of the soya bean working group, which aims to fight deforestation in the Amazon. Has social investment programme focused on food security where it operates. Signatory to the Soy Moratorium. Also runs the André and Lucia Maggi Foundation (FALM), which was founded in 1997 and supports local communities and runs a scholarship programme among other activities. • This article was amended on 7 June 2023. The certification of Agropalma’s palm oil plantations was suspended by the certification body IBD, not by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil as an earlier version said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9a7', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/a-visual-guide-to-deforestation-in-brazils-amazon-rainforest', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'A visual guide to deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest', 'lead': 'Fortunes of world’s largest rainforest and its Indigenous inhabitants have risen and fallen with political leadership', 'author': 'Anna Leach, Harvey Symons, Lucy Swan and Patrick Greenfield', 'datePublished': '2023-06-02 12:00:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563305', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/31ffee721f918068ab0b7827f9dd74aa145e26a2/0_371_5568_3341/500.jpg', 'body': 'The destruction and degradation of the world’s largest rainforest has happened in fits and starts. Spanning eight countries, the Amazon rainforest is home to an enormous concentration of life and culture. About half of it is located in Brazil, which is also the heart of the destruction. The forest’s fortunes have risen and fallen with political leadership. About 17% of the Amazon has already gone, replaced by vast cattle ranches, mines and soy fields. If that figure reaches 20% to 25%, scientists believe the rainforest will lose the ability to sustain itself, with disastrous consequences. “We stand exactly in a moment of destiny: the tipping point is here, it is now. The peoples and leaders of the Amazon countries together have the power, the science, and the tools to avoid a continental-scale, indeed, a global environmental disaster,” wrote the Brazilian scientists Carlos Nobre and Thomas Lovejoy, the godfather of biodiversity, in 2019. Between 2004 and 2012, Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and the first Rousseff administration achieved huge drops in deforestation – it fell by 84% in that period. This was an internationally rare achievement; Indonesia is the only other large tropical country to have achieved a significant drop in deforestation over a prolonged period. Since then, the progress has been reversed, especially under the leadership of the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, when a ferocious war on nature took place, including attacks on the territories of the Indigenous peoples who live in the Amazon. Illegal land mining and farming grew as the funding for environmental agencies was cut and and protections removed, with an area larger than the size of Belgium being cleared. Lula has vowed to end deforestation in the Amazon but it will not be easy. In February, two months into his administration, deforestation reached the highest levels ever recorded, although a 68% drop was achieved in April. As the Brazilian Amazon has been cleared, its composition has changed. From 1985 to 2021, satellite imagery shows that farming and mining have replaced virgin forest, with cattle ranching and soy in particular taking up large areas. While mining has significant impacts on water quality, and causes other forms of pollution, it takes up tiny areas compared with agriculture, which has been the major driver of forest loss. The view from space The impact on the Amazon is so vast it can be seen from space. In 2020, Dom Phillips reported from Novo Progresso, a settlers’ town in Pará state, at the beginning of the fire season. Google Earth imagery between 1980 and 2023 shows how the area has been transformed. “Fires – three times more common in Amazon cattle farming areas – are used to clear forest for pasture. Fragile law enforcement means fines are ignored. And when the loopholes that allow farmers to sell cattle raised on illegally burned or deforested land are taken into account, the future for Novo Progresso’s forests is not bright. Instead, it is black with smoke,” Phillips wrote after speaking with local people, some off the record for fear of repercussions from Bolsonaro’s government. There are hundreds of places like Novo Progresso that have been transformed in the Brazilian Amazon, being industrialised as the forest disappears.

A data-driven investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ), the Guardian, Repórter Brasil and Forbidden Stories shows systematic and vast forest loss linked to cattle farming. The beef industry in Brazil has consistently pledged to avoid farms linked to deforestation. However, the data suggests that 1.7m hectares (4.2m acres) of the Amazon was destroyed near meat plants exporting beef around the world. The investigation is part of Forbidden Stories’ Bruno and Dom project. It continues the work of Bruno Pereira, an Indigenous peoples expert, and Dom Phillips, a journalist who was a longtime contributor to the Guardian. The two men were killed in the Amazon last year. Deforestation across Brazil soared between 2019 and 2022 under the then president, Jair Bolsonaro, with cattle ranching being the number one cause. The new administration of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has promised to curb the destruction. Researchers at the AidEnvironment consultancy used satellite imagery, livestock movement records and other data to calculate estimated forest loss over six years, between 2017 and 2022 on thousands of ranches near more than 20 slaughterhouses. All the meat plants were owned by Brazil’s big three beef operators and exporters – JBS, Marfrig and Minerva. To find the farms that were most likely to have supplied each slaughterhouse, the researchers looked at “buying zones”; areas based on transport connections and other factors, including verification using interviews with plant representatives. All the meat plants exported widely, including to the EU, the UK and China, the world’s biggest buyer of Brazilian beef. The research focused on slaughterhouses in the states of Mato Grosso, Pará and Rondônia, important frontiers of deforestation associated with ranching. It is likely the overall figure for deforestation on farms supplying JBS, Marfrig and Minerva is higher, because they run other plants elsewhere in the Amazon. All three companies say they operate strict compliance procedures, in an open and honest manner, to ensure they are meeting their sustainable goals. Nestlé and the German meat company Tönnies, which had supplied Lidl and Aldi, were among those to have apparently bought meat from the plants featured in the study. Dozens of wholesale buyers in various EU countries, some of which supply the catering businesses that serve schools and hospitals, also appeared in the list of buyers. Nestlé said two of the meatpackers were not currently part of its supply chain, and added: “We may scrutinise business relationships with our suppliers who are unwilling or unable to address gaps in compliance with our standards.” Tönnies said: “These Brazilian companies process many thousands of animals per year for export,” and claimed it was unclear whether the company was the recipient of products from plants linked to deforestation. Lidl and Aldi said they stopped selling Brazilian beef in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Some of the meat shipped to the EU could breach new laws designed to combat deforestation in supply chains. Regulations adopted in April mean products brought into the EU cannot be linked to any deforestation that happened after December 2020. Alex Wijeratna, a senior director at the Mighty Earth advocacy organisation, said: “The Amazon is very close to a tipping point. So these types of figures are very alarming because the Amazon can’t afford to be losing this number of trees … this has planetary implications.” The MEP Delara Burkhardt said the findings reinforced the need for greater legislation globally to tackle deforestation: “The destruction of the Amazon is not only a Brazilian affair. It is also an affair of other parts of the world, like the EU, the UK, or China that import Amazon deforestation. That is why the consumer countries should enact supply chain laws to make sure that the meat they import is produced without inducing deforestation. I hope that the new EU law against imported deforestation will be a blueprint for other major importers like China to follow.” Aidenvironment found that 13 meat plants owned by JBS were linked to ranches where there had been forest clearance, felling or burning. For Marfrig and Minerva there were six and three plants respectively. According to a separate Guardian analysis for the Bruno and Dom project, the Amazon slaughterhouses belonging to these companies processed cattle worth more than $5bn (£4bn) while still in Brazil in 2022: more value will be added further along the complex supply chain, and by an overwhelming margin the economic value of this industry is being realised outside Brazil, on dinner plates at restaurants in Beijing and New York. They have repeatedly been criticised for deforestation in their supply chains over the last decade. Other companies are also known to source cattle from the same buying zones. In cases where the full beef supply chain could be mapped, the study estimated that since 2017 there had been more than 100 instances of forest loss on farms that directly supplied company plants. More than 2,000 hectares of forest were apparently destroyed on a single ranch between 2018 and 2021 – São Pedro do Guaporé farm, in Pontes e Lacerda, Mato Grosso state – which sold nearly 500 cattle to JBS, though the copany said the farm was ‘blocked’ when its due diligences identified irregularities with them. The JBS meat plant that processed these cattle sold beef to the UK and elsewhere in recent years. The farm was also connected to the indirect supply of more than 18,000 animals across the three meat packers between 2018 and 2019 according to Aidenvironment. All three companies said they were not currently being supplied by the ranch. More than 250 cases of deforestation were attributable to indirect suppliers – farms that rear or fatten cattle but send them to other ranches before slaughter. (Some farms act as both direct and indirect suppliers.) Meat companies have long said that monitoring the movements between ranches in their complex supply chains is too difficult. Critics say this allows for “cattle laundering”, where animals from a “dirty” deforesting ranch are trucked to a supposedly “clean” farm before slaughter, disguising their origin. A clean farm is one with no history of fines or sanctions for deforestation, even if its owner has carried out deforestation on other ranches. TBIJ and Repórter Brasil worked with Dom Phillips and the Guardian to report on an example of cattle laundering in 2020. Then, the team appeared to show that cows from a farm under sanctions for illegal deforestation had been moved in JBS trucks to a second, “clean” farm. After the story was published, JBS stopped buying from the owner of both farms. However, our investigation has found that the owner now supplies Marfrig, another of Brazil’s big three meat packers. One of his farms, Estrela do Aripuanã, in Mato Grosso state, is still under sanctions but remains part of the international beef supply chain. Records appear to show that between 2021 and 2022, nearly 500 animals were moved along the exact route that TBIJ investigated in 2020. The cattle ended up at the same “clean” second farm, Estrela do Sangue, which has no embargos or other environmental sanctions. Separate documents appear to show dozens of animals moving from Estrela do Sangue farm to Marfrig’s meat plant in Tangará da Serra. Last year, another TBIJ investigation linked the Tangará da Serra plant to the invasion of the Menku Indigenous territory in Brasnorte. According to shipping records, the plant has sold more than £1bn worth of beef products since 2014 to China, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK. In a statement, Marfrig confirmed it had received cattle from the owner, saying: “With every transaction it makes, Marfrig checks the status of the cattle-supplying properties. At the time of slaughter, the farm in question was compliant with Marfrig’s socio-environmental criteria, meaning the property was not located in an area with deforestation, embargo, or forced labour, nor in a conservation unit or on Indigenous lands.” It added: “Marfrig condemns the practice referred to as ‘cattle laundering’ and any other irregularities. All suppliers approved by the company are regularly checked and must comply with the mandatory socio-environmental criteria described in the company’s current policy.” Minerva said it “tracks the condition of the ranches, ensuring that cattle purchased by Minerva Foods do not originate from properties with illegally deforested areas; possess environmental embargos or are overlapping with Indigenous lands and/or traditional communities and conservation units.” JBS queried the “buying zones” methodology used in the research, saying it states “the estimate determines the potential maximum purchase zone and not necessarily the effective purchase zone.” It also said that it blocked the São Pedro do Guaporé farm “as soon as any irregularity was identified”. When asked, it did not specify the date.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9a9', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/window-closing-cop28-change-course-climate-dubai', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘The window is closing’: Cop28 must deliver change of course on climate', 'lead': 'With six months until UN summit in Dubai, can its oil executive president bring unwilling countries into line?', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-02 11:00:01', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563341', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/504ed20400d701f32df86f1b1fd8d696b9b5c26f/0_102_6000_3600/500.jpg', 'body': 'Within the next five years, the world is likely to experience at least one year in which the global average surface temperature exceeds 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. That was the stark prediction of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) this week, in its climate forecast. Straying beyond 1.5C could lead to potentially irreversible effects on the global climate system, scientists have warned, including the collapse of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, the abrupt melting of permafrost, rising sea levels and bleaching coral reefs. For these reasons, the 1.5C limit is at the heart of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which bound countries to hold global temperature rises “well below 2C” and “pursuing efforts” to 1.5C. Breaching the 1.5C threshold in one or even two years will not be enough to invalidate the Paris agreement. The rise would have to be sustained over several years or more before such a judgment could be drawn, and the WMO has said it is still possible temperatures could fall back again slightly. But it would be a huge blow to global climate action and a terrifying reminder of how close we are to the precipice of irretrievable harm. Changing course on the climate is still possible with concerted action, and governments will have the opportunity to do so in six months’ time at Cop28, the latest iteration of the annual UN climate talks. This year will mark a significant milestone: the first assessment since 2015 of how countries are faring against the emissions-cutting commitments they made at Paris, a process known as the “global stocktake”. While we already know in outline what the stocktake will say – that we are well off track to make the emissions cuts needed to stay within 1.5C and meet the Paris goals – the setting out of our failures in detail could yet be the spur for action needed, optimists believe. Alok Sharma, the UK Conservative MP and former minister who led the Cop26 talks in Glasgow in 2021, says the task is clear. “Cop28 must deliver strengthened emissions reduction targets, and a commitment to peak global emissions by 2025,” he said. “[There must be] a plan to turbocharge the clean energy revolution, and a commitment to phase out fossil fuels. And a meaningful agreement on how to scale up finance, both public and private, to support developing nations to decarbonise their economies – moving from the billions to the trillions.” Tom Evans, of the E3G thinktank, said the exercise provided a lever to push recalcitrant countries to higher efforts: “The global stocktake will not tell us anything new – we have more than enough evidence of the large gap between what’s needed [in emissions cuts] and the reality – but the global stocktake is mandated under the Paris agreement, so parties have to respond with increased ambition.” That is the theory. But even the most optimistic supporter of Cops may find their bright hopes ebbing in the face of Cop28. The last UN climate summit, Cop27, ended in Egypt last November with some joy and much frustration: triumph for developing countries that demanded climate justice from the rich world, in the form of a “loss and damage” fund to pay for the ravages of extreme weather they are suffering; and frustration that few countries stepped up with concrete plans on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preferring instead to prevaricate and procrastinate over the future of fossil fuels. Sharma warned starkly in the closing minutes of Cop27 that the world would pay a high price for that failure, and other countries lined up to agree with him. They were angry that some countries had appeared to want to slow down agreement, unpick progress and water down commitments. A resolution to phase out fossil fuels, with the support of more than 80 countries, was discarded, and the final text contained only weak language on meeting the 1.5C goal. Since then, the situation has not improved. Nations are still at loggerheads over the Ukraine war, geopolitical tensions between the west and China are high, and inflation and economic woes are afflicting rich and debt-ridden poor countries alike. Meanwhile, emissions are still rising. Any Cop would be challenging under such dire circumstances. For Cop28, there is an added twist. It will take place in Dubai, hosted by the United Arab Emirates, a leading oil and gas producer. And the official chosen to preside over the summit – Sultan Al Jaber – is the chief executive of the country’s national oil company, Adnoc, which is planning a big expansion of production capacity. A diplomat from one developed country said: “It could not be much worse.” Another said: “You could not make this stuff up.” Jaber’s appointment in January was greeted with disbelief and dismay by climate campaigners and experts around the world. “If I were asked how to make Cop28 a success, I would not put the head of a fossil fuel company in charge of organising it,” said Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate at the Grantham Institute, at Imperial College London. “I would not invite lobbyists from fossil fuel companies. I would try to see that everything was done to remove fossil fuels from the energy supply globally as soon as possible.” Since his appointment, Jaber has attracted further controversy. He has invited the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, to the summit, to the outrage of human rights campaigners. He has also hired David Canzini, a former Downing Street operator who helped to kibosh renewable energy plans when advising Boris Johnson, and fanned Liz Truss’s enthusiasm for fossil fuels. There have been whisperings of internal turmoil within the presidency: at least three PR companies that were working, or hoping to work, on aspects of the summit have had contracts terminated, and at least two high-ranking officials have recently left, one for personal reasons. Most damagingly, Jaber was hit with a stinging broadside by the former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, one of the architects of the Paris agreement. In her Outrage and Optimism podcast, she accused him of imperilling Cop28 by appearing to favour carbon capture and storage technology, as a way of enabling fossil fuel use to continue. “From a Cop president perspective, it’s very dangerous. I just don’t see most countries, and certainly not the vulnerable countries, being willing to support the Cop president on this because it is a direct threat to their survival,” she said. For Jaber, the criticism comes as a surprise and a challenge, which he has responded to by embarking on a global listening tour that has taken in governments, civil society groups, scientists and industry, both the high and low carbon varieties. “Do not prejudge me,” he pleaded with his critics, arguing that as it is the fossil fuel industry that must change most to stave off the climate crisis, an oil industry insider was best placed to make that change. “Proactively, I decided I want to go and engage with everybody,” he told the Guardian in a rare interview. “I am here promoting inclusivity for Cop28 – I want everyone to be heard, and I want everyone to have face time with me. So I travelled the world and I met even with those who attack me publicly. I made it a point to go and see them.” The results had been encouraging, he said. “While I appreciate all the feedback I got from everybody, representing all sectors and all industries, I promise you, the best feedback I got and the best advice I got was the uncensored feedback, guidance and advice that I received from NGOs and civil society. Everywhere,” he said. “Starting from the UK, to France, to Germany, to Copenhagen, to India twice, to China, New York, Houston and Washington DC, twice.” For proof of his intent as Cop president, Jaber said he was not a conventional oil industry executive. Although he was handpicked by the then ruler of UAE, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to lead Adnoc in 2016, Jaber started out quite differently. He was the co-founder in 2006 of Masdar, a renewable energy company specialising in solar farms and wind, investing globally and operating in 40 countries including the UK and US. Jaber is still chair of Masdar and has commanded a large rise in its production. “I am passionate about this [renewable energy],” he said. “I believe in it.” On the issue of carbon capture, Jaber’s defence is that the technology will be needed and that countries should work together on all ways of reducing emissions and tackling the climate crisis. “If we were just laser focused on reducing emissions, while investing in the acceleration of renewable energy, and investing in the acceleration and deployment of new and emerging viable zero-carbon emission new sources of energy, I think we’d be in a much better place. But to get there, we need to stop the fingerpointing. We need to stop this polarisation. We need to flip the page and start focusing on being optimistic, positive and working together in harmony.” As well as persuading countries to come up with concrete plans on emissions cuts, in line with the Paris agreement goals, Jaber will have to find answers to the parallel – and just as tricky – question of financial support for the poor world. Cop27 ended with a resounding victory for developing countries on the vexed issue of loss and damage. This refers to the catastrophic effects of extreme weather, which are already laying waste to many countries – such as the devastating floods in Pakistan last year, which affected 33 million people and wiped a third off the country’s GDP. Vulnerable countries hit by such disasters need funds for rescue, relief and rehabilitation. But rich countries at Cop27 first strenuously opposed setting up a dedicated loss and damage fund, only relenting when faced with the scorn and anger of developing countries’ governments. Their victory means a loss and damage fund will be set up but there is still no agreement on how it will be filled. Mohamed Adow, the director of the NGO Power Shift Africa, said: “Last year’s agreement on the loss and damage fund was a breakthrough, and showed the climate vulnerable countries that the UN process could actually deliver for them. But that moment will only be worth anything if the fund is set up quickly and money starts to flow. We need to see progress on that in Dubai.” Rich countries may prefer to try to take longer over the fund, setting out only the structure of such a fund this year, without considering ways to provide the cashflows. Adow says that will not wash. “My big hope is that we get more than vague discussion on loss and damage. Not a single person living on the frontlines of climate change has actually been helped by leaders agreeing to set up a fund last year,” he said. “Only when money starts to actually reach those people to help them rebuild their lives will it mean anything. Rich nations must not be allowed to turn this Cop into a talking shop.” Funds could be raised on a more permanent basis through mechanisms such as carbon taxes, or levies on high-carbon activities such as frequent flying, according to proposals tabled by developing countries last year. Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados, has floated a 1% tax on the sales of fossil fuels globally. But none of these suggestions yet has widespread support among rich countries. Another question is who should contribute. The UN framework convention on climate change, parent treaty to the 2015 Paris agreement, was signed in 1992 and many of the countries classed as developing then – and therefore not required to contribute finance – are now much richer, including China and oil-rich countries such as Saudi Arabia, and the host, UAE. Bernice Lee of the Chatham House thinktank said: “We are coming to the point where whoever is capable should find a way to contribute [to a loss and damage fund] and that should include all countries who can. Everyone knows some countries have benefited from high oil and gas prices recently. UAE should be corralling countries that have the resources to help.” Jaber said UAE was not yet ready for such a call. “I’m not in a position to answer this,” he said. “That’s not my speciality.” With six months to go before Cop28, there is not much time to bring recalcitrant countries into line, on emissions or on finance. Cop participants who spoke to the Guardian voiced rising concern that they are still not clear what Jaber’s plans for Cop28 will involve, and how he will prove UAE’s own carbon-cutting credentials. Next week, countries will gather in Bonn, Germany, for two weeks of preliminary talks laying the groundwork for Cop28, the only scheduled negotiating session before Dubai. If Jaber is to win over his critics and pull off a diplomatic coup at Cop28, that is where he must start. Rachel Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher school at Tufts University in the US and a longtime participant in Cops, said: “There is pressure on and scrutiny of UAE and Dr Sultan [Al Jaber] to prove their management of the Cop presidency is for the planet and not the energy status quo. They still have an opportunity to show oil sector leadership to accelerating the transition, but the window is closing. The presidency needs quickly to show where its ambition lies in ending the fossil fuel era and ramping up the era of renewables. They are uniquely placed to do so, but the world needs to understand the plan.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9aa', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/el-nino-may-push-heating-past-15c-urgent-action-avert-catastrophe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'El Niño may push heating past 1.5C but urgent action could avert catastrophe', 'lead': 'Without emissions reductions, in next 10 years 1.5C target may be permanently exceeded', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-02 11:00:01', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563359', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/c26985ad011ee0c900b9ef2f62f1d7788745c614/0_237_4242_2545/500.jpg', 'body': 'For several years, the world has been in the grip of La Niña, a weather system in the Pacific that tends to bring cooler temperatures around the world. Despite that, there has continued to be strong rises in global surface temperatures, with some of the hottest years on record. This year, the oscillating Pacific weather system will probably turn to its opposite, the warming El Niño. That is likely to turbocharge temperatures, and within the next five years we can expect to see new records set, according to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). The previous highest global annual average temperature above pre-industrial levels was 1.28C, but there is now a roughly two-thirds likelihood that surface temperatures will breach 1.5C for at least one of the next five years. But the rise in temperatures could be temporary, the WMO said. While the trend marches upward, some years are still likely to be slightly cooler, and when the El Niño weather system eventually wanes again and re-enters the opposing, cooling La Niña phase, that could bring down levels from their peaks. Mark Maslin, a professor of Earth system science at University College London, said: “Within the next five years the extra warming that comes with El Niño events will temporally push the global climate over the 1.5C. It may then drop back below 1.5C, allowing climate change deniers to tell everyone the world is now cooling – as they always ignore the long-term trend.” But he said any respite would be temporary. “Global [greenhouse gas] emissions have yet to drop, and emissions in 2022 were the highest in human history. Hence the long-term warming trend will continue, and without emission reductions we could pass 1.5C permanently in the next 10 years.” Even if that does happen, the temperature goal in the Paris agreement is still worth fighting for, Maslin argues. “This does not mean we should give up on the 1.5C target – far from it. It was an ambitious and aspirational target set by all nations at the Paris climate conference in 2015 and at Cop28 we must re-enforce the global commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible. “If we ultimately fail to keep global climate to below 1.5C, then we fight for 1.6C and then 1.7C and then 1.8C – because as scientists we know that every 10th of degree of warming will make a huge difference to the impacts of climate change. And the extreme weather events we have experienced over the last few years are just a warning shot to what is to come if we cannot switch to cleaner energy and lifestyles.” Bob Ward, a policy director at Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics, adds: “The 1.5C target refers to the trend in global average temperature, and not just a single year. While we may breach the threshold for a year in the near future, the main risks are associated with the trend reaching 1.5C within the next couple of decades, when most years will be 1.5C or warmer than the pre-industrial level.” Some people have tried to argue that the 1.5C threshold is a political rather than a scientific target. There will be serious impacts on the climate at 1.4C of warming, and 1.6C, and so on, observes Friederike Otto, a senior lecturer in climate at Imperial College London. But science shows that we should not regard 1.5C as without harm. Otto said: “There will be more irreversible consequences at 1.6C than at 1.5C, but there will also be irreversible changes at 1.4C compared with 1.3C. But we should not say that 1.5C is a safe limit – we are already at 1.2C of heating and people are dying, ecosystems are dying as a result. So 1.5C is a political compromise, not a safe physical limit.” Ward adds: “The 1.5C threshold is a political target, as identified in the Paris agreement, but it is based on science, particularly the assessment published in 2018 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It showed how the impacts increase significantly with warming beyond 1.5C, and the risks of crossing major thresholds also rise. The evidence that some impacts, such as intense heatwaves, are beginning to appear earlier than expected could be an indicator that the risks of breaching 1.5C have been underestimated.” Scientists know there are “tipping points” within the climate system, when warming triggers a cascade of impacts – for instance, the melting of the ice caps, or the point at which a drying Amazon turns from rainforest to savannah. More of these tipping points are likely to be triggered, the higher temperature goes. There are actions we could take to try to reduce global heating in the short term, chief among them reducing emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. Produced by inefficient fossil fuel operations, and from animal agriculture and waste, methane is about 80 times more potent in warming the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, but it is relatively short-lived, breaking down into carbon dioxide within about two decades. Plugging the leaks in oil and gas wells and coalmines would go a long way to reducing methane emissions, and could even be profitable with today’s high gas prices, according to the International Energy Agency. But any such measures must be accompanied by broader emissions reductions, as this is the only way to stop the upward march of temperatures. Ward said: “Most analyses, including the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, show that it will now be very difficult, given where we currently are, to stop the trend in temperature exceeding 1.5C within the next few decades. In that sense, the battle to keep 1.5 alive has probably failed. “The world has failed to recognise the scale of the risks clearly spelled out by the scientists, and has failed to mount an adequate response. But that does not mean we should abandon the target as we can still avoid many serious impacts if we can bring down global mean surface temperature so it is lower than the 1.5C target by the end of the century.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9ab', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/weather-tracker-shanghai-reports-record-high-temperature-of-367c', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Weather tracker: Shanghai reports record high May temperature of 36.7C ', 'lead': 'Heatwave continues in southern and eastern Asia as temperatures exceed 40C in vast swathes of region', 'author': 'Lauren Herdman and Matt Andrews (MetDesk)', 'datePublished': '2023-06-02 08:37:53', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563376', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/82e8b955ec14db27eeafb3a95d1c0b4154c7f169/0_97_5000_3001/500.jpg', 'body': 'Shanghai in China has reported a record high May temperature of 36.7C, breaking the previous record by 1C. The new high temperature on 29 May comes amid the heatwave affecting southern and eastern Asia since mid-April. Vast swathes of the region have had temperatures exceeding 40C, with parts of Pakistan reaching almost 50C in mid-May. South-east Asia has been affected particularly badly, with record high national temperatures in Laos (43.5C), Vietnam (44.2C), and Thailand (45.4C). This is due to low amounts of rainfall over the previous winter resulting in drier soils, which can heat up more quickly than moist soils, thus exacerbating the effect. The heatwave is estimated to have affected a third of the world’s population, and has led to at least 17 deaths and 60 hospitalisations from heatstroke. Many local authorities have taken measures such as closing schools and offices early and imposing restrictions on outdoor activities, while farmers and other outdoor labourers have reported being unable to continue working past mid-morning. Last week, the first cheetah cubs to be born in India for more than 70 years succumbed to the heat. As people turn to fans and air conditioning, the demand for electricity has led to power outages. The Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has been hit by frequent power cuts in recent weeks, with blackouts of up to 12 hours leading to protests outside power stations. Meanwhile, Vietnam implemented rolling blackouts of up to seven hours to cope with demand, with the city of Hanoi reducing the amount of public street lighting. The heatwave will continue into June, with parts of western China looking most likely to see new temperature records in the coming days. Meanwhile, as Antarctica moves towards winter, sea ice is rapidly expanding but remains well below the long-term 1981-2010 average. The current extent is about 1.8m sq km below normal, a record low for this time of year. Scientists are closely monitoring the progress of ice formation, keen to determine whether this anomaly is down to natural variability or a longer term change as a result of human-induced climate breakdown. Sea ice influences the global climate through maintaining the Earth’s energy balance and plays an important role in protecting and stabilising Antarctica’s ice shelves, as well as being important for marine biodiversity. • The headline and text of this article were amended on 2 June 2023 to clarify that 36.7C is a record high temperature for May, not overall as an earlier version implied.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9ac', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/27/nature-lovers-guardian-young-country-diary-writers', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'C’mon kids!

Every three months, as the UK enters a new season, we ask you to send us a piece written by a child aged 8-14. The article needs to be about a recent encounter they’ve had with nature – whether it’s a basking lizard, a twittering bird or a wildflower meadow. Crucially, it doesn’t matter if the child is a nature expert or has never picked up a pair of binoculars. We are especially keen to reach teachers who might like to get their class outside and noticing nature. Six winning entries will be published in the Guardian newspaper and online – two on 24 June, then two in July and two in August. In September, we will launch a fresh callout for autumn pieces. Note that if you send your piece in early, you stand a chance of being published on 24 June. How your child can take part First of all, we’re looking for children age 8 to 14, so we will need your permission, as parent or guardian. Then here’s what the child needs to do: Step 1 – Go out one day to where there is some nature. It could be their local woods or beach, their garden, a farm, or simply the nearest park. Step 2 – Write an article of 200-250 words telling us what they saw and what happened. Step 3 – Send the article to us using the form below. We ask that you fill in the form yourself rather than the child. Photos/drawings – These are helpful (especially landscape rather than portrait) but they are not a condition of entry. If you have some, please tell us in the “more information” field, as there’s no way to attach them to the form. Hints and tips for any budding YCD writers If the child gets stuck and doesn’t know what to write about, here are a few pointers: • Good nature writing starts with the senses – so what did you see and hear? What about smell and touch? Take notes when you’re out and about so you don’t forget • How would you describe what happened? Did it remind you of anything? • It’s great to look up some extra information about what you saw, and tell us about that too. For example, if you find an interesting-looking bug, see if you can find out what type of butterfly it was, how long they live – any juicy titbits! • You can think big, and describe the whole scene – the sky, the horizon, the landscape. Or you can think small, and tell us some details about the butterfly’s wings or the beetle’s markings. • What did your encounter with nature make you think about? How did it make you feel? The deadline for entry is noon on Thursday 29 June. Anyone can enter their child who is aged between 8 and 14 and based in the UK. You the parent/guardian will be contacted if your child’s piece is selected for publication, and you will be paid on behalf of the child. For further inspiration, here are a few recent Young Country Diaries: • Levi, 10, on lambing time at a farm • Oliver, 8, on his amphibian rescue mission • Mabel, 12, on the blackbirds in her garden Good luck, everyone!

Plans were submitted by hundreds of cities across five continents for a new prize that aims to promote sustainable travel – and it seems the appetite for active transport has truly gone global. Ten months after cities around the world were offered the chance to bid for up to $1m (£800,000) to build or expand new cycling and walking schemes, the money has been awarded to designs in Brazil, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, New Zealand and Albania, among others. The money was put up by Bloomberg Philanthropies, the philanthropic arm of the media conglomerate set up by Michael Bloomberg, during whose terms as mayor of New York the city sprouted a rapidly expanding network of cycle lanes. Bids were assessed in conjunction with Global Designing Cities Initiative (GDCI), an urban design NGO founded by Janette Sadik-Khan, who was New York’s traffic commissioner under Bloomberg. As well as the money – $1m for the winner and $400,000 apiece for the other nine cities – GDCI will help the cities with things such as design and local engagement. The top prize went to a plan to build more than 110 miles of protected cycle routes in Fortaleza, a city in Brazil’s tropical north-east, with a focus on helping children and older people use bikes, and promoting cargo bike delivery. Other bike lane-focused winners included Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, which is aiming to build Africa’s largest network of urban cycling routes; Mombasa in Kenya; the Albanian capital, Tirana; Pimpri-Chinchwad in Maharashtra state, western India; and Wellington, the capital of New Zealand. Quelimane, a major seaport in Mozambique, won funding for a plan that covers bike lanes and pedestrian spaces, but also proposals for parking and loading zones for the city’s ubiquitous bicycle taxis, as a way to reduce congestion. Two of the winners are especially focused on active travel for school pupils. Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, aims to connect 20,000 students to schools with protected bike lanes, while Milan in Italy submitted a proposal to connect 40 schools with a radial network of bike routes. The plan for Bogotá is specifically aimed at the mobility of children in a low-income part of the Colombian capital, based around a programme known as a ciempiés, or centipedes – organised walking caravans that help students get to and from school safely. James Anderson leads the government innovation programme at Bloomberg Philanthropies. He said the prize received entries from 275 cities across 66 countries, arguing this was a sign of the global interest in active travel. “Demand and interest in urban cycling is skyrocketing,” he said. “The need to offer residents more sustainable mobility options is also urgent and critical. But we all know that city infrastructure has not kept pace. “We haven’t seen the level of innovation, we haven’t seen the level of ambition that the moment demands.” The judges, he said, were not just looking for plans with coherent networks, but ideas that engaged with local communities, particularly ones seen as traditionally hard to reach for active travel schemes, such as Wellington’s focus on the city’s Māori population. “There’s a recognition now in city halls everywhere that expertise comes from lots of places, and a lot of it comes from the community,” he said. “If you want people in communities that have not typically participated in some of the sustainable mobility options, you need to go there and you need to work with them, need to get their thoughts on how to make cycling infrastructure useful in their day-to-day lives.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9ae', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/network-of-geothermal-power-stations-could-help-level-up-uk', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Network of geothermal power stations ‘could help level up UK’', 'lead': 'Many of Britain’s poorest towns are in areas with greatest potential for renewable energy, says report', 'author': 'Jillian Ambrose Energy correspondent', 'datePublished': '2023-06-02 06:00:07', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563430', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0f9f878f254b31f8b59168cf9ba37eb5436991d7/0_285_4000_2400/500.jpg', 'body': 'A network of underground geothermal plants is being touted as a way to help level up the UK after a report discovered many areas with the greatest geothermal potential lie beneath the towns and cities most in need of investment. Areas that have been earmarked by the government as part of its levelling up agenda are about three times as likely to be rich in untapped energy from the earth, according to an academic study commissioned by No 10. The University of Durham found these include Redcar and Cleveland, Middlesbrough, East Lindsey, Hartlepool, Northumberland and Bassetlaw, which all appear in the top 10 of the index used by government to identify local authority areas in need of levelling up. Other areas well-suited to producing geothermal heat and electricity include Newcastle upon Tyne, North East Derbyshire, the East Riding of Yorkshire and Nottingham. Harnessing geothermal energy involves drilling a borehole to depths of about two to three miles, to flow cold water at low pressures through the hot rocks beneath the Earth’s surface. A second borehole returns the warm water to the surface where it can be used to heat homes and businesses or generate electricity. Kieran Mullan MP, who was tasked with producing the report, said the “strong overlap” between areas in need of investment and the best geothermal locations was unexpected, but it could provide another reason for the government to look again at supporting the renewable energy technology. “Unlike wind or solar this technology provides baseload – it is there constantly. And our expertise in drilling in the North Sea means we are well placed to motor ahead,” Mullan said. The UK’s early steps into geothermal energy include a project in Seaham, County Durham, which will use water from mineshafts to heat 1,500 new homes and a scheme at the Eden project in Cornwall which generates heat to warm Eden’s rainforest and Mediterranean biomes as well as offices, kitchens and greenhouses. In theory, the UK has enough geothermal energy trapped underground to heat every home for a hundred years. Even by conservative estimates that account for realistic commercial and logistical limits, geothermal energy could help the UK to cut its imports of fossil fuels and rely only on the North Sea for its gas. “But we have catching up to do because across Europe there has been much stronger government intervention to support nascent deep geothermal industries in those countries,” Mullan said. Deep geothermal energy is abundant in Iceland owing to its unique geology but countries in western Europe are increasingly using geothermal energy to help produce green heating. Already more than 250,000 homes in Paris rely on geothermal heating and the German government has committed to spending €1bn (£860m) before 2035 to create 100 geothermal projects. Rishi Sunak said the report would help the government decide whether there was a bigger role for deep geothermal energy in the UK economy. “We have made rapid progress on switching to homegrown renewable electricity and have made energy security a key priority. Success is going to depend on pulling all the levers at our disposal,” the prime minister said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9af', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/climate-negotiations-are-inherently-abusive-campaigner-brianna-craft-on-the-struggle-smaller-countries-face', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Climate negotiations are inherently abusive’: campaigner Brianna Craft on the struggle smaller countries face', 'lead': 'In her memoir, the Cop delegate draws parallels with her violent childhood home and the imbalance of power in global summits', 'author': 'Maya Goodfellow', 'datePublished': '2023-06-02 05:00:07', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563449', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/717c99a2081bec417cfb3476dbcd44ce9444c629/0_272_6720_4032/500.jpg', 'body': 'When Brianna Craft arrived at her first UN climate conference in 2011, she was 24, optimistic and full of hope, believing that the negotiations were where the crisis would be solved.

Woven through with her reflections on her faith, the book aims to be a “personal, emotional narrative”, so that the crisis – and her colleagues and friends who try to agree solutions with rich, powerful nations – are made real for people in countries such as the US and UK. Craft has a brightness about her that is engaging and reflects the emotionally open way she writes. But her manner is not mirrored by her assessment of the crisis. A book charting the Cops between 2011 and 2015 could have a neat narrative arc: disappointment in 2013 and 2014, leading to triumph with the Paris agreement in 2015. Though there are inklings of this in the book, this is not Craft’s message. Careful not to downplay the hard work of her colleagues – many of whom we get to know, including Pa Ousman Jarju, a leading climate negotiator and former government minister from the Gambia – or the importance of the Cop for the countries they represent, she is highly critical of the climate summits and what they produce. The connection between climate violence and domestic violence simmers in the text, as Craft transports us between her childhood home in the small city of Kelso and her fast-paced professional life in conference centres around the globe. “Living with the climate crisis was so like living with him,” she writes about her father. “The stress and the fear. The constant risk of death. The building tension. The pressure and despair that impacts everything, underlies everything.” When we speak, Craft extends the parallel further; for her, the climate crisis is based in a similar injustice to domestic violence. “Those who are least responsible are bearing the brunt of the violence of climate-fuelled disasters [and] poverty; they emit the least pollution yet they are the ones who are dying.” Craft works with a collection of nations that are, in UN-speak, called the “least developed countries” group (LDCs), 46 of the poorest countries on Earth who represent more than one billion people. In these places, she says, people are five times more likely to die in climate-enhanced disasters than in the UK or in the US. Working on the climate crisis is now Craft’s full-time job, but she had not even heard of it until she was 19. On taking an environmental class at university because it was the easiest way to fulfil her science requirement, she learned what humans were doing to the environment. She was overcome by the scale of the crisis that she had played a role in creating but had not, until that moment, known about. She abandoned her plans to become an architect and wound up studying for a master’s in environmental studies at Brown University in Rhode Island. It was there at a weekly discussion group on global heating – with just $120 in her bank account, she had been drawn there for the free lunch – that she stumbled across the route to her first Cop. When her professor offered students the chance to intern at the approaching UN climate negotiations in Durban, South Africa, hers was the fastest hand to go up. Her role would be to support the LDCs, which that year were chaired by the Gambia. Another unpaid internship led to a paid position working at the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development thinktank, where she now works. The rush of the Cop is palpable in her retelling: adrenaline-fuelled meetings that stretch into the night, powerful world leaders all in one place, and the political will needed to reduce emissions seemingly within reach. But also present are the painful difficulties: the deadly inadequacy of the decisions made, the sexual harassment that is rife in male-dominated spaces, and her friends’ and colleagues’ desperate dedication repeatedly stymied by more powerful countries and economic interests. In person, Craft seems even more sceptical than in her book. “Rich, powerful countries have so much more ability to shape decisions as they want … so much of that power dynamic reminded me of the house I grew up in.” While the US can bring hundreds of people to the Cops – some of whom are employed all year round – the countries she works with cannot, especially not when the talks, and the first draft of every decision, are in English. Only after a decision is made is it translated into the six UN languages. Craft describes her role as a byproduct of these inherent imbalances. As an African American she describes a deep connection to the Gambia, but is aware that she does not know what it’s like to be from there, particularly given that she comes from one high-emitting country and is now living in another. “The UN climate negotiations are an inherently abusive space,” she says. Consensus-based decision-making means that what is agreed must be something that no country will object to, “so it doesn’t match the scale of the emergency we find ourselves in”. At the same time, “those who are responsible are not actively stopping the violence: they back out of the pledges, they make false promises, they walk away, they don’t deliver, and those who are being impacted are not empowered to hold them to account.” Under the Paris agreement, Craft points out that countries have only promised to make a pledge to bring down emissions. It shows. Fourteen years ago, Lumumba Di-Aping, then chair of the G77 group of developing countries, described 2C of heating above pre-industrial levels as “a death sentence for Africa.” Meanwhile, fossil fuel companies that last year posted record profits now have delegates attending the Cops in ever growing numbers, and in 2022 they had more representatives than any one affected frontline community. But, despite their shortcomings, Craft argues that the Cops remain important for poorer countries because it is one of the few spaces where they are included in discussions. They are not part of the G7 and G20, she says, where the “world’s highest-emitting countries make decisions”. This is one of the reasons she remains in her job. At Cop28 this year, Craft says two key things will be on the agenda: first, assessing countries’ pledges to ensure they do more in the next round of them; and, second, agreeing the specifics of the loss and damage funding mechanism. “We are now in a place where we will irrevocably lose whole societies … which is devastating, they need support and the funding mechanism for that.” Craft says people need to vote, to divest and to protest. “I come from a long line of civil rights protesting and civil disobedience, and I know that it is risky but it is necessary for basic protection for the African American population.” She is committed to using all the tools at her disposal. “It’s so fundamental to us to care and look after people in our lives”, she says. When it comes to fighting for our friends and family, most of us don’t question if we have the hope or resolve to act, we just do it. We should think about the climate crisis in this way too.” That way, she says, we “will find all we need to motivate ourselves to do something about it.” • In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

These were the two of the main messages from last month’s conference of air pollution scientists in Brussels. Held just a few hundred metres from the European Commission, it sent a clear message to EU policymakers about the opportunities from adopting ambitious targets. Each year across the 27 EU member states about 412,000 people die early from particle pollution, but this is just part of the impact. Air pollution is also a factor in many of our chronic diseases; it harms our health from before birth, through childhood and into our old age. Prof Barbara Hoffman, of the University of Düsseldorf, said: “Air pollution at current European levels is not for free – it comes at great costs in terms of hospital care, loss of working days, work incapacity and reduced intelligence in kids. All this translates into a huge and preventable expense.” New EU proposals fall short of adopting World Health Organization guidelines but would reduce legal limits for particle pollution by 60% and cut the limit for nitrogen dioxide by 50% by 2030. Objectors often cite costs as a reason for not acting. Methods for calculating costs and benefits vary between countries but the overall message is similar. The benefits from reducing the health burden from air pollution are so high that these almost always outweigh the investment. The US Clean Air Act and amendments are estimated to have saved the lives of 230,000 Americans in 2020. Add in reduced asthma, emergency room visits and days away from work and education, and the benefits add up to more than 30 times the investment. For the EU’s proposal, the projected benefit is at least 10 times greater than the cost and could be as much as 35 times greater. Extra benefits will also come from less pollution damage to forestry and valuable farm crops. The UK’s government’s air pollution targets for England are less ambitious than the EU proposal. They have the same target for particle pollution, but aim to attain this 10 years after the EU. They do not include new limits for nitrogen dioxide. The estimated benefit is between five and six times greater than the investment. Prof Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, of Barcelona’s Institute for Global Health, said: “The new EU directive, with tighter limits could be the biggest health intervention for a generation.” The World Bank estimates that the health impacts of air pollution amount to 6.1 % of global gross domestic product. The EU has an opportunity to become a world leader in technology and actions for clean air. Dr Hanna Boogaard, of the US Health Effects Institute, said: “The new EU proposal is a bargain investment and not a risky bet. Europe has shown global leadership before, in its green deal, its zero-pollution action plan and the Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan. The world is watching.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9b1', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/us-deal-turkmenistan-colossal-methane-emissions', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'US deal could plug Turkmenistan’s colossal methane emissions', 'lead': 'The central Asian country has the worst rate of climate-heating ‘super-emitter’ events in the world', 'author': 'Damian Carrington Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-02 05:00:06', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563485', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/65eadae909181b3d60041381eba51c460cd3c452/0_248_7360_4417/500.jpg', 'body': 'The US is in negotiations with Turkmenistan over an agreement to plug the central Asian nation’s colossal methane leaks. Turkmenistan was responsible for 184 “super-emitter” events in which the powerful greenhouse gas was released in 2022, the highest number in the world. One caused climate pollution equivalent to the rate of emissions from 67m cars. US officials hope that some leaks from Turkmenistan’s oil and gas industry could be halted by the start of the UN’s Cop28 climate summit in late November. Success would represent a major achievement in tackling the climate crisis. Methane emissions cause 25% of global heating today. A surge since 2007 may be the biggest threat to keeping below 1.5C of global heating above pre-industrial levels and seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points, according to scientists. Tackling leaks from fossil fuel sites is the fastest, simplest and cheapest way to slash methane emissions. John Kerry, the US special envoy for climate, spoke with the president of Turkmenistan, Serdar Berdimuhamedov, on Monday. In April, US secretary of state Antony Blinken met foreign minister Rashid Meredov in Washington DC, with Blinken “underscoring the critical importance of reducing methane emissions to combat the climate crisis and outlining opportunities to work with Turkmenistan”. “The US and Turkmenistan … will endeavour to feature methane mitigation outcomes by Cop28,” a US statement said. An agreement could see the US providing financial support and expertise, according to Bloomberg news. After the Kerry-Berdimuhamedov call, Turkmenistan’s foreign ministry recorded an “exchange of views” and said “systematic work is being carried out in our country … focused on the consistent introduction of advanced environmentally friendly resource-saving technologies in the oil and gas, energy, transport and other industries”. Satellite data shows little change in Turkmenistan’s methane emissions from 2019-2022. New satellite data is increasingly putting the spotlight on nations with major methane leaks. These include the US, where new regulations will impose large fines for leaks, and Russia. In early May, the Guardian revealed that methane leaks alone from Turkmenistan’s two main fossil fuel fields caused more global heating in 2022 than the entire carbon emissions of the UK. Emissions of the gas were “mind-boggling” and an “infuriating” problem that should be easy to fix, experts said. In March, the Guardian revealed that Turkmenistan was the worst country in the world for methane “super emitting” leaks, based on satellite data analysis by French company Kayrros. The leaks are believed to come from ageing and poorly maintained oil and gas pipelines and from the venting to the atmosphere of unwanted methane gas that is produced alongside oil, though gathering information on the ground in the repressive and authoritarian state is very difficult. A recent scientific study found significant leaks from just 29 pieces of equipment in one of Turkmenistan’s main fossil fuel fields. It also suggested a switch from the flaring of methane, when unwanted gas is burned, to venting was behind some of the vast outpourings. Burning the gas produces carbon dioxide, which causes about 80 times less global heating over 20 years. Relighting flares is straightforward and fixing leaks increases the amount of gas captured, increasing revenues. “Pumping gas out of the ground and immediately releasing it into the air is about as clever as driving a car over a cliff,” said Prof Euan Nisbet of Royal Holloway, University of London, a member of the scientific oversight committee of the UN International Methane Emissions Observatory (Imeo). “Kerry will deserve much credit if the US can help Turkmenistan rapidly cut its methane emissions.” Manfredi Caltagirone, head of Imeo, told the Guardian: “Reducing methane emissions is key to reaching the objective of the Paris Agreement. Turkmenistan is an important country of focus for global actions on methane emissions, but so are other major emitting countries such as Russia, US, Iran, Iraq, China, Libya, Algeria, Venezuela and Canada.” Imeo, hosted by the UN Environment Programme, is creating a global dataset of verified methane emissions that will be reported to countries to enable them to take targeted action and then made public.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9b2', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/02/country-diary-a-little-corner-of-suffolk-gloriously-recreated-in-the-big-city', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: A little corner of Suffolk, gloriously recreated in the big city | Susie White', 'lead': '<strong>Chelsea flower show, London:</strong> The idea behind Sarah Price’s garden is to capture the essence of artist Cedric Morris’s former home.

There’s the sweet lemon scent of Elaeagnus “quicksilver”, small yellow flowers tucked among silver willowy leaves. I feel hidden away in a quiet corner of a country garden, but the strident calls of ring-necked parakeets bring me back to London. This is the Chelsea flower show and the Nurture Landscapes garden designed by Sarah Price, one of the 12 main show gardens this year. It’s inspired by the plants and the spirit of Benton End, the 16th-century manor house in Suffolk where the artist and gardener Cedric Morris lived. Benton End was a hub of creative freedom, with Lucian Freud, Francis Bacon and Paul Nash among Morris’s liberal circle. It was there that he experimented with breeding bearded irises in unusual sultry colours. The house and garden, now gifted to the Garden Museum, are being revived as a place of art and horticulture. But here in Chelsea, Sarah’s garden is celebrating plants that Cedric collected on his winter travels. His Sicilian sweet pea, handed from gardener to gardener before returning to Benton End, is flowering against terracotta and ochre walls; walls where Sarah laid washes of plant-based paint over reclaimed canvases. Straw-cob walls are coated in lime render mixed with brick dust and sharp sand. I feel enveloped in their honey glow as the hubbub of the show recedes. Splayed against them, casting a delicate shadow, is Rosa mutabilis, where a white-tailed bumblebee feeds. There’s tumbling wisteria, tall angelica, corydalis and ferns, native quaking grasses and wood melick. Purple black aeoniums rise from sandy planters made from reclaimed materials, textured like oaty biscuits. Apricot alliums grow through gritty gravel and two pruned Scots pines give a Mediterranean feel.

A previously unreleased cost-benefit analysis, commissioned by a steering committee managing the outbreak of red fire ants and obtained by Guardian Australia, says eradication of the species provides “much higher returns” than suppression measures that simply limit its spread. The study says the spread of the ants, which were first detected in Brisbane in 2001, would cause “cascading negative impacts on future generations”. Australian governments have a $400m eradication program but, despite the investment, red fire ants continue to spread. Finds on the Gold Coast have raised concerns the pests are moving quickly towards New South Wales. “Fire ants are just a few kilometres from the NSW border and, when they break out, they can quickly spread everywhere in Australia,” said Reece Pianta from the Invasive Species Council. The report, by economists at Central Queensland University, modelled the economic impacts of the spread of fire ants if their invasion progressed at 5km a year, and a “maximum” spread of 48km a year. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In the first scenario, the pests will have reached high-value farmland in the Darling Downs by 2035. In the worst case, fire ants reach the Liverpool plains and the northern outskirts of Sydney in the same time period. By 2035 the annual cost to the economy in the 5km invasion scenario was about $890m, increasing significantly year on year. Under the 48km scenario, the costs would be about $1.2bn a year. The biggest cost would be to households, including the cost of pesticides, veterinary bills and electrical faults. “There are much higher returns available from eradication options compared to suppression options, largely because suppression would still lead to large impacts by [2035], especially on households and agriculture,” the report said. Pianta said the report supported calls for more investment in eradication measures. “The cost of action on fire ants is far cheaper than the cost of living with fire ants,” he said. “Fire ant damage predicted in the report is becoming a reality in southern Queensland. Fire ants are closing playing fields, garden centres and parks, impacting cane fields, schools, housing construction and natural habitat. “If we do not urgently step up eradication efforts, we face the fire ant future being experienced in the United States where fire ants cost $7bn per year in damage and control.” According to the Queensland government, fire ants may have arrived in Australia – possibly via shipping containers from the Americas – decades before they were detected.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9b4', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/brazil-amazon-crime-dom-phillips-bruno-pereira', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Brazilian Amazon at risk of being taken over by mafia, ex-police chief warns', 'lead': 'Alexandre Saraiva gives alert on organised crime in region ahead of anniversary of killings of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira', 'author': 'Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro and Jonathan Watts in Altamira', 'datePublished': '2023-06-01 12:00:34', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563539', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/a58ecbc16786428684c843eab68c8a7d581e8da5/0_142_4032_2419/500.jpg', 'body': 'The rapid advance of organised crime groups in the Brazilian Amazon risks turning the region into a vast, conflict-stricken hinterland plagued by heavily armed “criminal insurgents”, a former senior federal police chief has warned. Alexandre Saraiva, who worked in the Amazon from 2011 to 2021, said he feared the growing footprint of drug-trafficking mafias in the region could spawn a situation similar to the decades-long drug conflict in Rio de Janeiro, where the police’s battle with drug gangs and paramilitaries has claimed tens of thousands of lives. “I experienced how the state lost control of public security in Rio de Janeiro,” Saraiva said. “And in the Amazon today – if nothing is done in terms of public security – we are facing a continent-sized Rio de Janeiro, with the aggravating factors of borders with major drug producers and an extraordinarily difficult jungle setting.” Saraiva warned of dire consequences for the rainforest and its inhabitants if criminal gangs were allowed to grow into powerful armies like the rebel factions in neighbouring Colombia. “We will have criminal insurgents … [whose] ideology is money,” he said. “We will have areas of conflagration, of major conflict between groups which are fighting over areas of illegal gold and timber extraction. In the middle of this, we will have Indigenous victims. And we will face immense logistical difficulties in combating this,” warned the police chief, the author of a recent book called Jungle: Loggers, Miners and Corruption in a Lawless Amazon. The alert came ahead of the first anniversary of the killings of the British journalist Dom Phillips and the Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, whose deaths exposed widespread environmental devastation and the growing reach of organised crime groups in the Amazon. A year after their killings, the Guardian has joined 15 other international news media organisations and more than 50 journalists in a collaborative investigation into organised crime and resource extraction in the Brazilian Amazon, in an effort coordinated by Forbidden Stories, the Paris-based non-profit dedicated to continuing the work of reporters who are threatened, censored or killed. Figures collated for the Bruno and Dom project by the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety (FBSP) paint a bleak portrait of organised crime’s deadly impact on the region, showing that: With more than 8,000 deaths, the rate of intentional lethal violent crime in the Brazilian Amazon’s nine states was more than 50% higher than in the rest of the country last year – a murder rate similar to that of Mexico. In Amazonas state, where Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips were among 1,432 people killed last year, the murder rate was 74% above the national average. 2021 was even more violent with 1,571 victims and a violent death rate of 36.8 per 100,000 inhabitants – five times that of the US. The number of people killed by military and civil police grew 71% in the Amazon between 2016 and 2021, compared with 35% in the rest of Brazil. The Amazon’s prison population grew 35.1% between 2016 an 2022 compared with 14.1% elsewhere, helping prison-run factions to flourish in overcrowded jails. Brazil’s two most powerful crime factions – São Paulo’s PCC (First Capital Command) and Rio’s CV (Red Command) – now operate in all nine Amazon states, as do at least 15 other regional crime groups, including Os Crias, the Família do Norte and Class A Command. Last year, the FBSP revealed how the Amazon now contained 10 of Brazil’s 30 most violent municipalities. They included remote illegal mining and drug smuggling hubs such as Jacareacanga and Japurá, and Novo Progresso, a deforestation hotspot from where Phillips reported for the Guardian in 2020. All three towns had staggeringly high murder rates of more than 100 per 100,000 inhabitants. The advance of organised crime groups in the Amazon was laid bare by the killings of Pereira and Phillips last year in the Javari valley, an Austria-sized sweep of rivers and rainforests on Brazil’s border with Colombia and Peru, the world’s top two cocaine producers. Brazil’s environment minister, Marina Silva, told the Guardian that violence had long been “a hallmark of the predatory occupation of the Amazon”, pointing to the assassinations of activists such as Chico Mendes in 1988 and Sister Dorothy Stang in 2005. The military dictatorship’s decision to colonise the Amazon in the 1960s – supposedly to stop hostile foreign powers commandeering the sparsely populated region – sparked a deadly struggle for land and resources, devastated Indigenous communities and caused deforestation to soar. However, Silva said the “overlapping of multiple forms of criminality” in the Amazon now meant the state needed to increase its presence in affected regions. She highlighted the new government’s battle to evict illegal miners with links to the PCC from the Yanomami Indigenous territory. The Public Safety Forum’s president, Renato Sérgio de Lima, said the statistics collected by his group’s researchers underlined how the arrival of drug factions had made a bad situation worse, causing Amazon murder rates to soar even as they fell elsewhere in Brazil. Lima traced the advance of such groups into the Amazon to 2016 when a notorious drug trafficker was killed on Brazil’s border with Paraguay. That assassination helped the PCC consolidate its control of the drug smuggling route focused on the border town of Ponta Porã and forced its rival, the CV, to look further north to the Amazon. The CV’s destination was Tabatinga, a scruffy town on the tri-border with Colombia and Peru, near where Phillips and Pereira were killed last June. Lima estimated that the cocaine being smuggled through Brazil was now responsible for 4% of the South American country’s GDP – with about 40% of those illegal profits coming through the Amazon. “We are talking about something like $25bn being injected into the Amazon’s economy every year and the region isn’t ready to deal with this,” he said, warning that the response from the armed forces had been woefully inadequate, with the army and navy seizing just 41 firearms in 2022. Aerial images filmed by Brazil’s Globoplay, one of the news organisations involved in the Bruno and Dom project, showed a suspected cocaine laboratory and a series of coca farms that had been carved out of the jungles on the Peruvian side of the Javari. “If the Brazilian state doesn’t intervene in an urgent and firm manner, we’re going to have [entire] regions that are run by narco-traffickers,” said Beto Marubo, a prominent Indigenous leader who was close to Pereira. Lima warned that if nothing was done, “the military’s fear [of losing control of the Amazon] will become almost a self-fulfilling prophesy. We will effectively lose sovereignty over the region and the region will be consolidated as the main narco-trafficking smuggling route in Brazil and to Europe.” Rodrigo Chagas, an Amazon-based researcher who is studying the drug gangs’ rapid expansion for the FBSP, echoed the warnings of “Colombianisation”, which could see security forces launch a catastrophic “war on drugs” similar to the one that has blighted Brazil’s neighbour for decades. “It’s possible the Amazon will see tremendous havoc. This is a scenario that worries me, because the public security responses we tend to see are ‘war on drugs’-style responses – a war which is utterly detrimental to local populations,” Chagas said. Saraiva noted how Brazil’s armed forces had historically been obsessed with the supposed threat of an “external enemy” annexing the Amazon, a vast region nine times the size of France. “Meanwhile, we have an internal criminal insurgency which is corroding the Brazilian nation from within, [and] it’s happening far faster than we imagine,” warned Saraiva, who was the federal police chief in three Amazon states, Amazonas, Maranhão and Roraima. It was while serving in Amazonas that Saraiva came into contact with Pereira. In 2019, shortly before Pereira was forced from his job with the government’s Indigenous protection agency, Funai, the police chief helped the Indigenous defender launch a major anti-mining operation in the Javari region called “Operation Korubo”. Sixty illegal mining dredges were destroyed during those raids, which Saraiva believed put Pereira “in a very delicate position”. “In the Javari valley we have a convergence between drug trafficking, illegal fishing, illegal logging and mining. And in the middle of all this, there was a guy called Bruno [trying to fight environmental crime],” Saraiva said, remembering a brave and passionate activist with “selflessness in his DNA”. Federal police have named a shadowy local figure with suspected ties to organised crime as the alleged mastermind behind last year’s killings. Experts say at least four Brazilian drug factions – the CV, PCC, Os Crias and the Família do Norte – operate in the region, as well as groups from Colombia and Peru. Organised crime’s growing grip on the Amazon was again exposed last month when alleged PCC operatives attacked government forces during a raid on an illegal mine in the Yanomami Indigenous territory near Venezuela. Four men were killed in the shootout, including a PCC leader nicknamed “Presidente”. A message intercepted by police and shared with the Guardian showed PCC chiefs urging members to retaliate against police for “the deaths of our brothers”. “From what I understand, the PCC isn’t just there to extract gold. Of course they’re doing this too. But the main thing is to use the illegal airstrips to send weapons and drugs to other countries, like Venezuela,” said one police source. The story of Saraiva, whom Dom Phillips interviewed for the book he was writing about the Amazon, underlines the growing role of criminal factions in environmental crime. Two years after he stopped working in the Amazon, he still travels in a bulletproof car – the result of intelligence suggesting the PCC planned to assassinate him, even though his focus had been fighting environmental crime, not drug smuggling. “Organised crime is diversifying into other illegal activities that Brazilian society tends to see as lesser offences,” said Saraiva, who commanded Brazil’s largest ever seizure of illegal wood in 2020. “The mafia goes wherever there’s money. It doesn’t care if it’s environmental crime, people smuggling, cocaine. And what they see there [in the Amazon] is gold and wood that’s being sold for a very high price. It’s obvious that it wouldn’t take them long to get involved in this.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9b5', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/bruno-pereira-dom-phillips-deaths-amazon-2022-guardian-forbidden-stories-project', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'One year after the deaths of Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips, their work must go on', 'lead': 'On 5 June 2022, Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips were killed for protecting the Amazon rainforest.

Journalists should not be killed for reporting facts. But, one year ago, the Guardian was devastated by the awful news that in the Amazon rainforest, two lives had been taken on the frontline of the battle to protect the planet. Bruno Araújo Pereira, a renowned defender of the rights of Brazil’s Indigenous peoples, and Dom Phillips, an outstanding reporter, long-term Guardian contributor and friend to many who work here, disappeared while researching a book on how to save the rainforest. In the weeks that followed, when their bodies were discovered and our worst fears of their deaths confirmed, everyone at the Guardian was horrified. And from that horror was born a determination to continue the work they were doing, covering what our global environment writer, Jonathan Watts, has called “the global war against nature”. Today, we launch the Bruno and Dom project, a year-long collaborative investigation coordinated by Forbidden Stories that involves more than 50 journalists from 16 media organisations in 10 countries around the world. Together, we have worked with three aims in mind. First, to honour and pursue the work of Bruno and Dom. Bruno was totally committed to the traditional peoples of the Amazon and defending their ways of life, and Dom’s brave and humane journalism did so much to bring the stories of Brazil and Latin America to a global audience. We have picked up the threads of their unfinished stories, chased down leads and tried to carry on doing what they can no longer do. Second, to remind everyone of the beauty, importance and fragility of the Amazon. Watts, who moved to live in the rainforest in 2021 and is the Guardian’s first journalist to be permanently based there, has written about it being the heart of the world – “not the lungs, as is often mistakenly claimed”. But now it beats much less strongly than it did, and than it must, if human beings on this planet are to have a future. Third, to suggest ideas for how to save the Amazon, and, in time, inspire positive change. This was a central focus in all of Dom’s work, and something that much Guardian journalism strives for. The Bruno and Dom project, over four days of publishing, will include: The latest in the criminal investigation into their deaths, including the perspective of friends and family. Three men are currently being held in prison, and police have named a fourth as the alleged mastermind, while the former head of Brazil’s Indigenous protection agency under President Jair Bolsonaro has been charged on the basis that he ignored warnings over the risk of bloodshed in the Javari valley. The last photographs taken of Bruno and Dom before they were killed, and what they tell us. A wider exploration of how organised crime, including illegal fishing, hunting, logging and mining, is taking over the Amazon. An investigation into the global companies making billions from extracting raw materials from the rainforest, including how beef is eating up the Amazon, and the extent of deforestation. A detailed analysis of solutions for how to save the rainforest. The Guardian and Forbidden Stories, an international consortium of investigative journalists that pursues the work of assassinated journalists or those under threat, know only too well that what happened to Bruno and Dom is not an isolated crime. At least 67 journalists and media workers were killed in 2022, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, while Global Witness has found that three people are killed every week trying to protect their land from extractive forces, with Brazil one of the deadliest countries in the world for land and environmental defenders, many of them from Indigenous communities. We hope you will read, reflect on and share the Bruno and Dom project, with the spirit of defiance that has inspired it. The work must go on.

The phone was found last October when activists from Univaja, the Indigenous association where Pereira worked, returned to a stretch of flooded forest along the Itaquaí River where the men’s bodies were taken after they were shot dead on their boat on the morning of 5 June 2022. With the help of a metal detector, the group found several items belonging to the victims, including Phillips’s UK press card, two spiral notebooks the journalist and longtime Guardian contributor had taken on the four-day reporting trip into the Javari valley region, and one of two phones Pereira was carrying. Indigenous activists and police found other items belonging to the men in the same location during last year’s 10-day search for their bodies. After months underwater, Phillips’s notebooks were illegible. But federal police forensic teams were able to recover several images from the handset, according to the Brazilian broadcaster Globoplay, which was with the Indigenous activists when they made the discovery. They include one photograph, taken on the afternoon of Friday 3 June, that shows the British journalist chatting to a local man in Ladário, the riverside village where one of his alleged killers, Amarildo da Costa de Oliveira, grew up. The man Phillips is talking to is Oliveira’s brother-in-law, Laurindo Alves. Another photograph, taken shortly after 7am on Sunday 5 June, shows Phillips sitting in a boat near São Rafael, another fishing village on the Itaquaí. Minutes later, after casting off from that community, Phillips and Pereira came under attack. Da Costa de Oliveira and another local fisher, Jefferson da Silva Lima, last year confessed to the crime, telling police they were moved by anger over Pereira’s “persecution” of fishers the activist accused of illegal poaching in Indigenous lands. However, when they appeared before a federal judge earlier this month the two men offered a dramatically different version, claiming Pereira had attacked them and they had shot back in self-defence. The victims’ families and friends dismissed those claims as having no basis in reality. The recovered phone also contained two short videos which appear to support descriptions of the events in the days leading up to last year’s killings. Those videos, shot at just before 8am on 4 June 2022, show Oliveira travelling down the Itaquaí River past the shack where Phillips and Pereira were staying in a riverside community called Lago do Jaburu, just a few hundred metres from the entrance to the Javari valley Indigenous territory. Earlier that morning, members of EVU, the Indigenous patrol team Pereira helped create, spotted Oliveira travelling in the other direction, towards the protection base at the entrance to the Indigenous enclave. Indigenous patrollers say Oliveira threatened them by raising his gun into the air when he was challenged. The owner of the house where Phillips and Pereira were staying, a local fisher called Raimundo Bento da Costa, remembered the British journalist photographing Oliveira at the Indigenous expert’s request as he returned along the Itaquaí. “Bruno told [Dom] to take a photo and he took one … and showed it to us afterwards. [Oliveira] had loads of cartridges, red ones, [on his belt],” said Costa, who is Oliveira’s uncle. Twenty-four hours after those images were taken, according to their confessions, Oliveira and Jefferson da Silva Lima ambushed and killed Phillips and Pereira as they came down the same river on their way to the town of Atalaia do Norte. The phone also contained a selfie Pereira had taken during another mission in the Javari valley in May last year, as well as two aerial videos from a flyover during which illegal mining dredges were spotted along the region’s Jaquirana River.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9b7', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2023/jun/01/bruno-pereira-dom-phillips-amazon-indigenous-patrol-groups', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Bruno Pereira and Dom Phllips were killed in the Amazon.

Beers flowed, tongues loosened and the men were overheard bragging about their latest job. “We’re looking for this Orlando bloke. We’ve come to kill him,” one of the inebriated hitmen is said to have declared, according to a tipoff conveyed to their target. The Orlando in question was Orlando Possuelo, one of the Indigenous defenders who has been seeking to carry on the work of his colleague Bruno Pereira since Pereira was killed along with the British journalist Dom Phillips near the Javari valley Indigenous territory last June. The planned killing did not come to pass. Who ordered it is unclear. But Possuelo, who has seen two close associates murdered in the past four years, admitted the warning left him shaken. “Normally, I’m fairly relaxed about the threats … but there are days you wake up feeling a bit haunted,” he said. One year after the killings of Pereira and Phillips – which laid bare the environmental devastation inflicted under Brazil’s former president Jair Bolsonaro – Indigenous leaders and non-Indigenous allies such as Possuelo are intensifying their battle to protect the world’s greatest rainforest and the Indigenous peoples who have lived there since long before European explorers arrived in the 16th century. The activists are defiant in the face of the many dangers of confronting the environmental criminals and organised crime groups who have tightened their grip on the Amazon region. “If they kill me, I’ll go to heaven, because I’m defending my territory,” said Daman Matis, 27, who helps to police a riverside government protection base on one of the waterways that illegal goldminers use to invade protected Indigenous lands. Since taking power in January, Brazil’s new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has strengthened government efforts to protect Indigenous communities and the environment. It follows four years of chaos and destruction under Bolsonaro, during which deforestation and land invasions soared. Six Indigenous territories have been officially recognised, while federal police operatives, environmental special forces and army troops have been deployed to the Amazon in an attempt to reassert control and send a message to the world about Brazil’s commitment to eradicating illegal deforestation and fighting the climate emergency. “[We want] to inaugurate a new era in the region,” said Humberto Freire, the head of Lula’s newly created federal police department for the environment and the Amazon. In Atalaia do Norte, the remote river town to which Pereira and Phillips were travelling when they were ambushed, a colossal floating police base has taken up position, with a name hammering home that desire. Nova Era (New Era), read the golden yellow letters stamped on to the base’s black metal hull. Some local people believe the campaign is working. “So much has changed under Lula’s government,” said Rubeney de Castro Alves, who runs a hotel overlooking the Javari River where Phillips and Pereira stayed before starting their final mission. “I’m not just saying that because I voted Lula. It’s because the reality is that things have really changed.” For all the good intentions, there is still fear, uncertainty and violence in the Javari territory, which is home to the world’s largest concentration of isolated Indigenous groups. Indigenous communities and their non-Indigenous champions remain under siege. “I’d really love you to tell the story of how everything’s fine now and everything has changed. This is the story I’d like you to be telling,” Possuelo told the Guardian’s reporters as they returned to the region for the first time since last year’s killings as part of a collaborative investigation coordinated by Forbidden Stories paying tribute to the victims and the causes they held dear. “But the reality is that nothing’s changed.” Possuelo’s bleak assessment does not mean the Javari’s Indigenous activists are giving up the fight. Far from it. A new generation of defenders Phillips, a longtime Guardian contributor, was killed while reporting on the embryonic work of an Indigenous patrol group that Pereira and Possuelo had helped create called the Javari Valley Indigenous Monitoring Team, or EVU as it is known in Portuguese. Its mission involved equipping Indigenous scouts with technology, such as drones, GPS trackers and cameras. That equipment – coupled with their peerless knowledge of the rainforest – would help them detect crimes taking place within their territory, which is home to about 6,000 Indigenous people from the Kanamari, Kulina, Korubo, Marubo, Matis, Mayoruna and Tsohom-dyapa groups. On a recent afternoon, dozens of Indigenous men, several still in their teens, arrived at EVU’s headquarters in Atalaia do Norte to sign up to defend their ancestral lands from a four-pronged assault: poachers and fishing gangs encroaching from the north, drug traffickers from the west, goldminers from the east and cattle ranchers from the south. “What they did to Bruno and the journalist was so painful but we’re going to continue fighting our enemies until they can no longer bear it,” vowed the youngest of the group, 18-year-old Clenildo Kulina. Kulina grew up in a village on the Curuçá River, five days from Atalaia by boat, and it was there that he first met Pereira. The Indigenous expert, then working for Brazil’s Indigenous protection agency, Funai, was passing through at the start of one of his gruelling expeditions into the Javari’s jungles and ventured into the rainforest with Kulina’s uncle and cousin to search for isolated Indigenous tribes they hoped to protect. Kulina was too young to join them and Pereira’s death robbed him of the chance to work with the strapping indigenista once he came of age. “But now I have this opportunity and I’m going to take advantage of it,” he said. “If I have to die, it will be for our people.” Another young volunteer, Marcelo Chawan Kulina, had also come hoping to secure a place on one of the patrol teams that Pereira regarded as crucial to the survival of the Javari’s tribes. “I feel anxious and a little bit afraid,” the 25-year-old admitted. “It’s dangerous. When you confront the invaders, they shoot.” But he said he saw no other way of resisting the illegal forces obliterating the natural resources of his rainforest home; an immense sprawl of coffee-coloured rivers and dense jungle on Brazil’s northwestern fringe. “They kill our animals and steal the fish from our lakes. I want this to stop,” he said. “These invaders have seized control of Indigenous territory.” The suspects As a new generation of Indigenous activists position themselves on the frontline of a war to protect nature, prosecutors are working to bring the killers of Pereira and Phillips to justice. Three fishers are being held in high-security prisons awaiting trial for murder: two brothers called Amarildo and Oseney da Costa de Oliveira and a third man, Jefferson da Silva Lima. Amarildo, who is better known as Pelado, and Da Silva Lima first confessed to killing Phillips and Pereira after chasing them down the Itaquaí River as they returned from a four-day reporting trip to the entrance of the Javari valley Indigenous territory, though they later changed their story . “Why the fuck did you do this?” a third brother asked Pelado and Da Silva Lima as he helped them hide the victims’ belongings and bodies, according to a confession made by Pelado 11 days after the killings. Nearly a year later, the answer to that question remains confused. Pelado initially told police he killed Pereira in a fit of anger, infuriated by EVU’s “persecution” of the fishers who live along the Itaquaí. But recently he offered a different version, claiming they had only shot at Pereira after the Indigenous activist opened fire on them as they went out to fish. He denied the crime was premeditated or ordered by someone else. Speaking outside a courtroom in the city of Tabatinga, where a judge is considering whether the three men should face trial by jury, Oseney’s wife, Raimunda Nonato, insisted her husband was innocent. Nonato claims Pelado and Da Silva Lima opened fire in a “moment of rage” prompted by Pereira’s dogged pursuit of fishers and poachers. Yet some suspect more powerful and dangerous forces lay behind the killings. Federal police have named a fourth man – a shadowy local mobster nicknamed Colombia – as the suspected mastermind. Colombia, who reportedly holds Peruvian, Colombian and Brazilian citizenship, is behind bars and reportedly being investigated for allegedly bankrolling the illegal fishing gangs that plunder the Javari Indigenous territory. Nonato cried over her husband’s detention. “Everything has come crashing down,” she sobbed, voicing regret over Phillips’ killing. A history of violence Nonato’s life story speaks to the profound and enduring tensions between the Javari’s Indigenous and non-Indigenous inhabitants that provided the backdrop to last year’s killings. Decades ago, her father moved to the region from Brazil’s impoverished north-east to work as a rubber tapper, at a time when the government was urging citizens to occupy what it falsely called a “land without men”. Nonato was born in 1984, in a riverside hamlet called Camboa, as a ferocious conflict raged between the Indigenous communities and non-Indigenous incomers. Press cuttings from that era paint a brutal picture of the deadly tit-for-tat skirmishes between the Korubo, an Indigenous people known as the caceteiros (club carriers), and the loggers and rubber tappers pushing deeper into their lands. Korubo warriors used long wooden cudgels to bludgeon invaders to death. Loggers retaliated using shotguns and “gifts” of poison-laced food. Indigenous people were “gunned down like wild pigs”, one Indigenous expert, Rieli Franciscato, told the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, which estimated that hundreds of Korubo had been killed. Growing up in the jungle, Nonato caught fleeting glimpses of the Korubo. “They shave half their heads. They’re funny-looking and really strong,” she remembered. “I was scared of them.” Nonato said she felt relief when, in the late 1990s, Brazil’s government began expelling non-Indigenous outsiders, in an attempt to end the conflict and protect Indigenous groups from deadly violence and disease. The eviction forced her family to move closer to Atalaia, where there were schools. “Today, thank God, two of my brothers have been to university,” she said. Many local people, however, resented being kicked out of the Indigenous territory, believing they were being robbed of the right to make a living off the Javari’s abundant fish stocks, wildlife and wood. “We make our own laws here,” Atalaia’s then mayor, Marco Antônio Monteiro, told O Globo in 1996. “The Javari valley belongs to us and we will not allow the area to be sealed off.” The following years saw a succession of armed attacks on a government protection base at the conflux of the Itaquaí and Ituí Rivers, one of the main entry points to the Indigenous enclave. The violence reached a crescendo with the 2019 killing of Maxciel Pereira dos Santos, an Indigenous protection agent who had worked closely with Pereira and who was shot dead in Tabatinga. His assasins were never caught and the case appeared to have been forgotten until last year’s killings thrust it back into the spotlight. As the Javari valley was closed to outsiders, Pelado’s family relocated to Ladário, the first riverside village outside the territory’s border, on the banks of the Itaquaí. From jungle guide to poacher One of the last photographs of Phillips – recovered by forensic scientists from one of Pereira’s mobile phones – was taken in Ladário, two days before the killings, and shows the journalist sitting by the river in rubber flip-flops and a blue T-shirt, chatting to a fisher who is Pelado’s brother-in-law. Pelado’s uncle, Raimundo Bento da Costa, 53, remembers an energetic and solicitous teenager who played in football tournaments on Ladário’s large riverside pitch. “He wasn’t the kind of guy who went around fighting and rowing with people,” Costa said. “He was a pretty normal guy.” In 2002, when Pelado was 21, he was hired to take part in an expedition into the Javari commanded by Orlando Possuelo’s father, the legendary explorer Sydney Possuelo, in search of an Indigenous group known as the flecheiros, or arrow people. Scott Wallace, an American journalist and author who took part in that 76-day mission, first met Pelado on the Itaquaí, upstream from where Pereira and Phillips were killed, and described “a very amiable, upbeat kid who laughed a lot, and seemed to get along with everyone”. Pelado was also an expert backwoodsman who built jungle camps and cleared fallen trees as the expeditionaries advanced into the wilderness. “He’d just gotten married and his wife was expecting their first son, so he was really excited about the chance to join the expedition … and the family he was looking forward to raising,” Wallace said, recalling Pelado’s exhilaration at the prospect of catching sight of the uncontacted flecheiros. “It would be a story that he could tell to his children and grandchildren and he [thought he] would be greatly respected,” said Wallace, who today teaches journalism at the University of Connecticut. But over the coming years, Pelado became a source of fear, not pride, along the Itaquaí, according to local sources. His uncle said Pelado started organising illegal 15- to 20-day fishing expeditions into Indigenous lands, sneaking past the Funai guard post with half a dozen armed collaborators. By packing wooden boats with tonnes of pirarucu fish and a river turtle called the tracajá, Pelado could quadruple an investment of perhaps 10,000 reais (equivalent today to about £1,600). Costa sensed his nephew had become consumed by greed. “We never considered him particularly aggressive or anything like that. But he got too big for his boots. He wanted to be the boss. He wanted to rule over that area,” he said. Bruno Pereira and the EVU activists stood in the way of that dream, blocking Pelado’s forays into the rainforest and reporting his activities to the police. “So he thought: if we kill him, everything will be fine,” Costa said, voicing disgust at his nephew’s “cowardly” crime. Leonardo Schmitt, the federal agent now running Atalaia’s floating police base, expressed confidence that such a crime would not be repeated after his team’s arrival, but cautioned against underestimating “the nerve and audacity of these criminals”. Schmitt speaks from experience. In 2010, two colleagues – Mauro Lobo and Leonardo Matzunaga Yamaguti – were shot dead by Peruvian and Brazilian drug traffickers on the Solimões River after intercepting a boat smuggling 300kg of coca paste. “They died defending the Amazon too,” Schmitt said. Five men were later jailed for those murders. A Rio native, Schmitt is in the Javari as part of an operation named after the tucandeira, a wasp-like Amazonian ant notorious for its excruciating sting. “I think it’s a pretty appropriate symbol [of our mission] because it’s a big, carnivorous ant said to have the most powerful sting on Earth,” Schmitt said as he toured the waters around Atalaia do Norte in a speedboat, flanked by agents carrying assault rifles. “Our intention is to have a similarly striking presence.” ‘The land is part of our family’ EVU’s Indigenous activists have chosen a different Amazonian symbol to represent their battle to remember and resist. In the storage room of their Atalaia HQ, four cherry-coloured planks of maçaranduba redwood lie on the floor, the components of a memorial cross that friends plan to erect beside the Itaquaí. “It’s the heart of the forest,” said Carlos Travassos, an Indigenous specialist who is helping to train EVU’s patrol teams. “The idea is to mark … the place where they were murdered … to ensure it’s never forgotten.” One evening last month, the storeroom was a hive of activity as EVU’s newest volunteers prepared to journey into the rainforest for a five-day training session that would determine who made the cut. “I’m a rookie … but I’m not afraid. I feel courage,” said Txema Matis, 23. “The Indigenous are a courageous lot.” Paulo Marubo, a prominent Indigenous leader who was close to Pereira, offered a pre-mission pep talk. “The land is part of our family. The forest is part of our family [and] it’s up to each of us to defend our territory. Let’s get to work!” The next day, the 25-strong crew donned green uniforms and rubber boots and headed to the dilapidated port where Pereira and Phillips began their final journey. They cast off into the Javari’s turbid, dolphin-filled waters, heading west along the border with Peru, past an abandoned Peruvian police base that was attacked and torched by armed raiders five months before Phillips and Pereira were killed. Up on deck, Clenildo Kulina admitted there were risks involved in joining the struggle in which Phillips, Pereira, Maxciel Pereira dos Santos and countless others have died. But the teenager said he felt Pereira’s spirit guiding him as he embarked on what he hoped would be the first of many missions to ensure their ideas – and the Javari’s rainforests and rivers – remained alive. “He’s here with us, isn’t he?” Kulina said of Pereira, as a flight of swallows swooped over the bow. “We can feel that he is right here, among us – and I think that’s where he will always remain.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9b9', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/pfas-lawsuit-epa-plastic-containers-health-danger', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Plastic containers still distributed across the US are a potential health disaster', 'lead': 'The Environmental Protection Agency is suing the manufacturer, even as the company continues to make and sell its toxic products', 'author': 'Tom Perkins', 'datePublished': '2023-06-01 10:00:30', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563630', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/b1f5f4074f713cea34f81c33f51502a495657fc3/0_187_5616_3370/500.jpg', 'body': 'Consumer groups are condemning the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for allowing plastic containers made with toxic PFAS “forever chemicals” to continue being distributed across the economy – even though the agency is suing a top manufacturer over the dangerous compounds leaching into containers’ contents, such as food or personal care products. The groups are now intervening in the lawsuit and regulatory proceedings between the EPA and Inhance Technologies, which they estimate produces about 200m PFAS-contaminated plastic containers annually. A review of regulatory documents, court filings and patent applications shows Inhance appears to have repeatedly lied to regulators and customers about whether its containers shed PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) into products stored in them. Still, the EPA and the Department of Justice have not pointed out the company’s inconsistencies in court, and the groups have questioned whether industry influence at the EPA is playing a role in the agency’s decision-making. Last week, the groups formally asked the EPA to order Inhance to stop distributing the containers, and will soon file a motion asking a judge to do the same while highlighting the company’s inconsistent statements. “It’s a serious and ongoing threat to public health,” said Bob Sussman, an attorney representing the consumer groups. “It involves not only the demonstrated hazards of the PFAS that are in the containers, but the huge number of containers and their economy-wide uses.” PFAS are a class of about 15,000 chemicals often used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. The compounds are ubiquitous, and linked at low levels of exposure to cancer, thyroid disease, kidney dysfunction, birth defects, autoimmune disease and other serious health problems. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally degrade in the environment. The consumer groups include the Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (Peer) and the Center for Environmental Health. Their action is the latest salvo in a winding three-year regulatory and legal battle over widespread PFAS contamination in plastic containers, which the groups say is not being properly addressed by the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. Inhance did not respond to a request for comment, but the company previously told the Guardian it is “in full compliance with all relevant regulations”. Inhance treats plastic containers with fluorinated gas to create a barrier that helps keep products from degrading. The consumer groups and regulators have found the process creates long-chain PFAS as a byproduct. EPA rules implemented in 2020 require companies manufacturing long-chain PFAS to submit for a safety review and approval. The EPA seemed unaware that PFAS were being added to plastic containers until late 2020 testing by Peer found high levels of PFAS in pesticides stored in Inhance bins. The subsequent EPA investigation unearthed wide-scale contamination of plastic containers. In January 2021, the EPA subpoenaed Inhance for information about its fluorination process and publicly reminded the plastic industry that companies must submit for a safety review if they manufacture long-chain PFAS. In July 2021, the Guardian reported on the use of PFAS in industrial containers that hold ingredients for food, essential oils and other products. At a meeting with the EPA in September 2021, Inhance dismissed the agency’s evidence showing its containers leached PFAS into pesticides by claiming the chemicals came from the pesticide. The EPA disagreed, issuing a March 2022 violation notice that ordered Inhance to “immediately cease” production, if it had not yet eliminated the PFAS contamination. Two weeks later, Inhance put out a press release stating it was “pleased to announce” its products did not “impart” long-chain PFAS. The company, at the time, did not cease production or submit its fluorination process for review. Using information obtained from the violation notice, the EPA wrote in an 8 September 2022 report that additional testing again found “[Inhance’s] container walls leached [PFAS] into the contents of the container”. Around the same time, Inhance informed the EPA that it would finally submit its fluorination process for review, but refused to cease production. Still, the EPA did not file a lawsuit or alert the public, or press Inhance to halt production. In a September webinar aimed at customers, Inhance again publicly claimed its products did not leach PFAS: “Our chemistry does not impart any of these [PFAS] that the EPA is concerned about, and never has … We are not sure where EPA thinks it’s seeing [PFAS] species but it’s not from Inhance.” But officials at Inhance likely knew those statements were untrue. In documents submitted to the EPA just two months later, the company admitted it had known since January 2021 that its fluorination process created nine long-chain PFAS, which it wrote was “an apparently unavoidable aspect of fluorination of [high-density polyethylene] containers”. “Extensive work by [Inhance] since January 2021 has shown that there is no easy solution to the problem of [PFAS] formation,” the documents state. Moreover, a 2011 peer-reviewed study of Inhance’s containers when the company operated as Fluoro-Seal found they leached PFAS. In 2019, the company applied for a patent for a process that would address the problem. “After telling the world there was no PFAS in their containers, they are admitting, basically, the chemicals’ presence is unavoidable,” Sussman said. Inhance late last year also began claiming that an April 2022 adjustment to its fluorination process reduced PFAS leaching to negligible levels. That was contradicted by a late 2022 peer-reviewed University of Notre Dame study of Inhance containers. That study found PFOA and other PFAS still leached from the containers at levels as high as 94 parts per billion, or about 3m times above the limit for PFOA in drinking water. Inhance has repeatedly characterized these levels as “low”. In October, the consumer groups filed a notice of intent to sue that was part of the citizen’s lawsuit process under the nation’s federal toxics laws, giving the EPA and Inhance 60 days to take action to meet their demands. After 56 days, the EPA filed its own lawsuit against Inhance, prompting the court in January to dismiss the consumer groups’ lawsuit on grounds that the EPA had taken action. But the EPA’s suit did not ask the court to order Inhance to immediately halt production of the contaminated containers while the case played out. Instead, it asked the court to order Inhance to stop production if a review of the company’s fluorination process by EPA’s new chemicals division found the leaching to be a threat to human health. The new chemicals division is at the center of whistleblower allegations that division management has acted at the industry’s behest and has altered scientific documents to make dangerous compounds appear safe. The EPA’s change of position on whether Inhance should cease production during the safety review and failure to address the company’s inconsistencies in court could stem from industry influence, said Kyla Bennett, a former EPA scientist with Peer who has coordinated whistleblower complaints in the EPA. “Judging from what my clients have told me over the last three years, I have zero confidence [the new chemicals division is] going to make the right decision on this,” she said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9ba', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/how-disinfecting-old-mineshaft-saved-colony-little-brown-bats-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'How disinfecting an old mineshaft saved a colony of little brown bats', 'lead': 'Using chemicals in the environment can save wildlife from deadly pathogens, but process is not without risks, say experts', 'author': 'Jack McGovan', 'datePublished': '2023-06-01 10:00:30', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563648', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0567bd19598a5ce6f371d608777ccea300534bdc/0_285_3808_2285/500.jpg', 'body': 'Joseph Hoyt and his team first showed up to the abandoned mineshaft in Wisconsin during the late summer of 2017, personal protective equipment in hand. Long before Covid-19, the supplies were to protect them from the chlorine dioxide gas they had brought along. Their aim was to use the disinfectant gas to kill the Pseudogymnoascus destructans fungus lining the walls of the mineshaft, which had already killed millions of bats across North America. “You’re talking about essentially an entire taxonomic group that has been reduced by over 90% – it’s like the equivalent of losing all birds or something like that,” says Hoyt, an assistant professor in disease ecology at Virginia Tech University. This isn’t just bad for the victims – bats play an essential role in ecosystems by consuming large numbers of insects, dispersing seeds and pollinating. Rather than solely relying on host-to-host transmission, the fungus persists in the environment. Once infected, the bats develop white-nose syndrome, where the fungus compels them to burn through their fat reserves while hibernating, depleting them of the energy they need to survive. Other diseases, such as snake fungal disease and avian influenza, have also been shown to persist in the environment and scientists are becoming increasingly aware of the need to act on environmental reservoirs of disease. Hoyt first became aware of white-nose syndrome when it emerged in a town next to where he was working as an undergraduate. “It was brought here by human movement,” he says. In Europe and Asia, where the fungus is also active, bat populations are not being decimated. Hoyt says this is because the fungus dies off in the summer. An effort to recreate that dynamic in North America is what inspired the disinfection idea. “We didn’t completely eliminate the pathogen from the environment and so there’s still some fungus in there,” says Hoyt. Although they didn’t test how other microbial communities were affected by the disinfection, Hoyt reasons that as the fungus wasn’t completely eradicated, it’s unlikely that other microbes were. During the initial field test in 2017, the concentration of chlorine dioxide was too weak and no change in transmission was recorded. After doubling the concentration in the following two years, they started getting results. For the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), overwinter survival rates from white-nose syndrome increased from 14% to 76%, and between-winter survival rose from 7% to 59%. Hoyt and his team aren’t the only ones to have successfully slowed transmission through disinfecting wildlife habitats. A team led by Dr Jaime Bosch, senior scientist at the IMIB-CSIC institute in Spain, managed to eradicate the Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis fungus from artificial ponds in Mallorca for two years. The fungus causes amphibian chytridiomycosis and, much like white-nose syndrome, is pushing some amphibians towards extinction. “The only solution we found is to apply chemicals in a particular population where the fungus is killing the animals,” says Bosch, whose research was published in 2015. They removed the animals from the ponds, treated them with an antifungal, and then treated the ponds with a fungicide. “This was a very expensive and demanding process,” says Bosch. In the years since, he has been working with toads in Andalusia, in southern Spain, and their strategy has changed. Now, they add a fungicide directly to the pond, without removing the animals. He says, however, that it’s a fungicide commonly used in agriculture and, citing yet to be published data, says that it is undetectable after 24 hours and has no impact on the microbiota of the ponds. “We’re trying to do something now because we’re seeing many populations disappear and we have no time to wait,” says Bosch. In some senses, Hoyt’s work is a lot easier, as it is possible to disinfect the mineshafts in summer while the bats are not hibernating. There are, however, other limitations. The treatment must be applied every year, and so requires long-term commitment. Otherwise, the sites they treated were quite small, ranging from about 20 to 40 metres long. This was largely, but not only, for practical reasons. “We’ve never really proposed to do this in caves, given the sensitivity of those environments,” says Hoyt. “There’s likely unique microbiota and stuff that are present in these sites, and so you wouldn’t want to go in and just try to sterilise the environment with the potential of having some kind of adverse impact on other things that exist in those sites.” He suggests, however, that larger sites could be treated, for example by identifying sites that bats tend to flock to and limiting treatment to those areas. “We have to think very carefully about the collateral damage that would result from some of these strategies,” says Pejman Rohani, a professor in infectious disease ecology at the University of Georgia, who has previously considered using chlorination to target avian influenza. “The unintended consequences may be hard to quantify.” He uses Delaware Bay as an example, a place he calls a “hotspot for avian influenza”. In such a location, he says, the wildlife effects of a chlorination strategy “would be just disastrous”. In other situations, he is not entirely opposed. “If we’re dealing with the last population of a species at a particular location, then it’s possible that a draconian control strategy – despite its unintended consequences or collateral damage – might be worth considering,” he says. Dr Demetra Andreou, principal academic in environmental science at Bournemouth University, is equally cautious. “This is like a last resort, and one that has to be applied really carefully,” she says. “It should only be used when there is a huge problem, such as in cases where the species would become locally effectively extinct if you didn’t take any measures.” Andreou says that there should be more modelling using empirical data when deploying a strategy such as chlorination, as there is a chance that disinfection could select for a more harmful strain. She adds that solutions such as vaccines should be prioritised, as there is also a limit to where you can disinfect. “I think there needs to be public awareness that prevention is much more important to reduce the risk of transferring these diseases between new places and then putting new species at risk,” Andreou says. Hoyt agrees that prevention is the most effective strategy, but argues that white-nose syndrome is so widespread it requires a more active approach. Citing research from 1999 and 2001, he also suggests that vaccines in wildlife populations aren’t very effective, and in some cases can even make things worse. He agrees it is possible that disinfection could create a more harmful strain, but points to a meta-analysis which found no evidence that more persistent pathogens – those that may be more likely to survive disinfection – are more harmful. While under no illusions that disinfection is a perfect strategy, Hoyt says globalisation is spreading disease and disrupting natural systems. “In those instances, I think there is some obligation to try to intervene, and certainly when it’s the case of potentially losing an entire species,” he says.

Customers can claim money back for buying a range of gas appliances, such as $500 for ducted heating, $400 for hot water, $400 for a gas log fire and $100 for a cooktop, with Jemena putting up $250,000 for the promotion. Jemena has defended the promotion, arguing the industry is decarbonising and gas offers an affordable alternative. But environmentalists reject this claim. The program is in contrast to policies in Victorian and NSW aimed at winding back gas use and shifting towards renewables, such as rebates for homeowners who install solar panels. Victoria has a program with incentives for homes to replace gas appliances with efficient electric alternatives. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Nature Conservation Council and Environment Victoria have criticised Jemena for offering financial incentives to switch to gas in the midst of a climate crisis. “It’s a backward step,” Environment Victoria’s policy and advocacy manager, Bronya Lipski, said. “Gas is on the way out, the industry knows it is on the way out, and this is one of those last-ditch attempts to hang on for as long as possible, and squeeze as much profit out of the community.” Brad Smith, policy and advocacy director at the Nature Conservation Council, said national gas, which consists mostly of methane, was a major contributor to the climate crisis. “Every new appliance connected to gas locks in decades of guaranteed profits for Jemena, and decades of pollution for the rest of us,” Smith said. Michael Pintabona, a spokesperson for Jemena, said gas has a “lower carbon footprint than coal” and makes more economic sense in Australia. “Short-to-medium term calls to electrify household appliances will simply move customers away from gas … to an electricity grid which is still currently overwhelmingly reliant on coal.” He said the company was working on evolving its gas network to “transport renewable gases in the future” and said a mixture of gas and renewables was the best way for Australians to power their homes in the future. But Lipski said methane gas will never be renewable, as it is a fossil fuel, and it will probably be “prohibitively expensive” to switch methane gas systems to hydrogen-powered ones. “ So even in the extremely remote possibility that this happens, it’s going to take far too long – inconsistent with the speed required to mitigate climate change,” she said. “We know that the solution to this whole problem is electrification powered by renewables.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9bc', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/heres-proof-fishing-bans-leave-plenty-to-eat-says-study-of-mexico-marine-park', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Here’s proof fishing bans leave plenty to eat, says study of Mexico marine park', 'lead': 'Scientists compared catch data from four years before and after a permanent ban and found minimal impact on commercial fishing', 'author': 'Sophie Kevany', 'datePublished': '2023-06-01 05:00:24', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563686', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d5a9566dc40cac201ad264ade662de7217273a90/0_1317_3724_2234/500.jpg', 'body': 'Banning fishing in a Mexican marine park did not reduce the fishing catch, according to a new study that says it has dispelled the “myth” spread by fishing companies that protecting marine areas leaves less fish available for people to eat. The before-and-after study looked at whether banning commercial fishing from the Revillagigedo national park, which covers 147,000 sq km (57,000 sq miles) of Pacific Ocean west of Mexico, would reduce the country’s catch volumes. The answer was no, said the study’s authors, who said the finding showed that “large, fully protected MPAs [marine protected areas] can contribute to a more sustainable and equitable use of the ocean, without major economic repercussions on the fishing industry”. Before fishing in the MPA was banned in 2017, Mexico’s $1bn fishing sector had warned it could reduce their catch of tuna and other pelagic fish by 20%. But catch data comparisons from the four years before and after the ban showed the MPA “had no causal effect on catches or area use, and therefore did not cause harm [to the Mexican fishing fleet]”, said Fabio Favoretto, a postdoctoral scholar at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, and the lead author of the peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Science Advances. One reason for the MPA’s apparently minimal impact on commercial fishing, he said, might be that the protected area “was almost insignificant” compared with the expanse of ocean available to the Mexican fleet. Another “highly speculative” conclusion might be the existence of more fish in the areas around, as well as inside, MPAs, caused by a “spillover effect” into the surrounding seas, he said, adding that the research team aimed to look at this issue in its next study. Favoretto said it was not possible that significant levels of fishing could have continued undetected in the protected area, with boats potentially killing their transponder signals before entering the park. “Because we were able to see the fishing activity elsewhere, so we didn’t have gaps [in the activity data], we saw them somewhere else,” he said. By law Mexico’s fishing fleet is required to carry vessel monitoring system (VMS) transponders, which must be left on and are physically difficult to turn off, Favoretto said. “You can switch off AIS [another boat tracking system], but you cannot switch off VMS, and our data is from the VMS.” He said that neither had there been any significant displacement of fishing activity to other areas. “We looked at the displacement effect, but there was not more of that,” he said, adding that ships were not going out further than before, with the fleets apparently catching the same volume of fish in a reduced area. Illegal fishing during the four years was minimal as well, the researchers found, with average fishing activity within the MPA declining by 82%. Infractions were higher just after the ban, Favoretto said, and dropped to zero once a specialised marine crime monitoring programme called Skylight was fully implemented in 2021. “I was surprised there was not more illegal fishing … and this is another message [from the study],” he said, adding that compliance was unexpectedly high. The idea that MPAs might mean more, not less, fish for fleets is not new, said Enric Sala, one of the study’s co-authors and the National Geographic Society’s explorer-in-residence. “A study last year showed the yellowfin tuna catch around the Papahānaumokuākea Monument, [the world’s largest no-fishing zone, off the coast of Hawaii] increased by 54%,” he said. Sala added: “It’s really a myth that we can’t protect more of the ocean because we need more fish to feed more people. The global fishing catch has been declining since the mid-90s, yet only 3% is protected from fishing. The worst enemy of the fishing sector is not protected areas, it’s overfishing.” Measuring the fish population in and around the Revillagigedo MPA, which protects humpback whales, whale sharks, silky sharks and manta rays, is the researchers’ next goal. They hope to see more MPAs, too. “Last year at Cop15, the countries agreed to [protect] 30% of the oceans by 2030. If Mexico wants to meet that goal, it will need two to four more Revillagigedos,” said Octavio Aburto, a third co-author and Scripps’ professor in marine biology and biological oceanography. However, there is no single model of MPA, Aburto said. The Revillagigedo national park MPA was helpfully situated far from land and people, which helped minimise threats and made policing easier, he said. MPAs closer to where people lived would need a “completely different conservation strategy”, he said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9bd', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/country-diary-tick-tock-its-tick-oclock', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: Tick-tock, it’s tick o’clock | Sara Hudston', 'lead': '<strong>Porlock, Somerset:</strong> Beware these tiny blood-sucking arachnids – they are thriving in the countryside and urban parks after the wet spring', 'author': 'Sara Hudston', 'datePublished': '2023-06-01 04:30:23', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563705', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/97db8e1d0eebefc91c907b47f1db6913b1e83b4c/691_380_2211_1326/500.jpg', 'body': 'English wildlife has very few dangers. Adders – our only venomous snake – are scarce, shy and non-deadly to humans. European hornets (Vespa crabro) look and sound intimidating, but are rarely aggressive. Even the plentiful moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) that sometimes swarm beaches and harbours cannot sting. Yet I am wary of one creature, especially in summer. Usually less than 1cm long, it is typically found in areas of rough grazing, woodland or moorland where there are rabbits and wild deer. Exmoor provides a perfect habitat, and it is especially abundant here. In recent days, I have found many crawling through my dog’s fur, or hanging like dark, berried drops around her nose and eyes. These are ticks: blood-sucking arachnids that feed on mammals, including people. I have never known ticks to be so numerous as they have been in the last few weeks. It’s not just my perception; scientists at Bristol University are getting reports of a sudden rise in numbers. They think that this year’s cool, wet spring delayed tick emergence, and then the warm May caused a sudden flush of vegetation, providing ideal conditions for their survival. After a walk in Horner Woods, I find seven on my dog’s head, picked up while she was nosing herbage along the side of the path. These are castor bean ticks (Ixodes ricinus), bay-coloured with chestnut-brown, seed-shaped bodies and black legs. Hedgehog ticks (Ixodes hexagonus), the species found most often on cats, seem to be less common. Measuring no more than 4mm when unfed, the fully engorged hexagonus females can bloat into greyish-white blood-swollen bladders of up to 1.3cm long. Ticks find hosts by climbing plant stems and waiting, forelegs outstretched, sensing heat and movement. When an animal brushes past, the tick hooks on, seeking a spot to bury its hypostome, the barbed tube that anchors it in place and through which it sucks. As with other parasitic lifeforms, feeding can transmit bacteria into the host’s circulation. Some ticks carry Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, which cause Lyme disease, a debilitating illness requiring treatment with antibiotics. And it’s not only a countryside issue – the castor bean tick can be found in city parks across the UK. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9be', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/pesticide-firms-withheld-brain-toxicity-studies-from-eu-regulators-study-finds', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Pesticide firms withheld brain toxicity studies from EU regulators, study finds', 'lead': 'Exclusive: The same studies were submitted to US regulators and some are relevant to safety levels, the researchers say', 'author': 'Damian Carrington Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-01 04:00:22', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563724', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/ab8233e4ad50cb16477739487a69d08b5b545950/253_945_5119_3071/500.jpg', 'body': 'Pesticide companies failed to disclose a series of studies assessing brain toxicity to European regulators, according to new research, despite the same studies having been submitted to US regulators. When the EU authorities were made aware of the studies, between 14 and 21 years after they were conducted, new safety limits were applied in some cases and evaluation is still under way in other cases. The researchers described the omissions as “outrageous”, concluding that “apparently non-disclosure is a problem that is not rare” and that there could be “no reliable safety evaluation of pesticides by EU authorities without full access to all performed toxicity studies”. The new research is the first systematic assessment of non-disclosure and focused only on developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) studies. The researchers found 35 DNT studies submitted to the US Environmental Protection Agency as part of the pesticide approval process but found that nine of these had not been included in dossiers sent to the EU authorities for the same pesticides. Among the findings in the undisclosed studies were changes in brain size, delayed sexual maturation and reduced weight gain in the offspring of laboratory rats exposed to a pesticide when pregnant. The pesticides identified in the new study include the insecticides abamectin, ethoprophos and pyridaben and the fungicide fluazinam. These are, or have been, used on a range of crops including tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes and aubergines. “Brains are unbelievably complex and so central for us being humans, and damage to brain development is immensely costly to societies,” said Dr Axel Mie, at Stockholm University, Sweden, who led the new study. “So it’s really important for us to make sure that the chemical products we use are not damaging the brains of our kids and grandchildren.” Prof Christina Rudén, study co-author and also at Stockholm University, said: “Most important to me is the principle to have to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It is outrageous, what they’re doing.” Sarah Wiener, a Green party MEP from Austria and the European parliament rapporteur for new EU pesticide regulation proposals, said: “The analysis shows that the pesticide industry is fooling EU authorities. In the end, it is EU citizens who pay the price. Their health is jeopardised when relevant studies are withheld.” “The EU therefore needs to make sure that there are harsh consequences for the withholding of data,” she said. “This could mean that corporations would have to pay considerable fines.” EU regulations state that pesticide dossiers should “include a full and unbiased report of the studies conducted [unless] it is not necessary owing to the nature of the product or its proposed uses, or it is not scientifically necessary. In such a case a justification shall be provided.” A spokesperson for the European Commission said: “There is a clear obligation to submit all available adverse data as part of applications since 2013, and there is an obligation to notify adverse data when they become available since 1991.” The power to penalise companies if they unlawfully fail to disclose toxicity studies in Europe lies with national regulators. But no known penalty has been imposed on any pesticide company to date. The UK pesticides regulator, the Health and Safety Executive, did not answer a request for comment. In correspondence seen by the Guardian, a senior official in the European Commission’s directorate for health and food safety expressed “serious concern” in September 2022 after being made aware of two of the undisclosed studies: “The fact that certain applicants have apparently not provided studies with an unfavourable outcome for certain active substances as part of the application dossiers is a serious concern.” The chemical companies said they had complied with the EU regulations, in some cases arguing they were not legally obliged to submit the studies. They also disagreed with the researchers’ conclusions that some of the studies had led to tighter regulation when the EU authorities had become aware of the studies’ existence, or that they could do so in the future. Previous work estimated that exposure in the EU to organophosphate insecticides, which are now banned and were not part of the new study, caused brain damage costing €146bn a year in lost productivity. The new report said: “For some compounds, it has taken decades from the initial evidence of DNT effects in humans until such hazards became widely recognised.” The study is published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Health. It found nine undisclosed DNT studies produced between 2001 and 2007, up to 20 years before the submission of the most recent EU regulatory dossiers. The EU authorities became aware of the studies between 2017 and 2022, the researchers said. Standard DNT tests expose pregnant female rats to a pesticide and assess their offspring for neuropathological and behavioural changes. The tests have been shown to identify chemicals known to cause DNT damage in humans, though in some cases humans are substantially more sensitive than the rodents. Three of the undisclosed DNT studies have already led to regulatory changes, after subsequent evaluation by EU regulatory authorities, according to Mie and Rudén. For the pesticide abamectin, for example, new health-based safety levels for people were set, they said. For ethoprophos, Mie and Rudén said the DNT study “contributed to” it being banned by EU authorities in 2019. Bayer, the company that commissioned a DNT study on ethoprophos in 2004, denied this. The EU ruling that banned the pesticide said “the risk assessment could not be finalised” for DNT or other areas of concern and also noted a “high acute risk” to birds and soil organisms. Bayer sold ethoprophos to another company in 2010. Another four undisclosed DNT studies could have “a potential effect on toxicological reference values or hazard classification”, based on Mie and Rudén’s assessment of the US EPA’s evaluation of the studies. One DNT did not have any regulatory impact and insufficient information was available to assess the potential regulatory impact of the ninth study. Some of the pesticides have been banned for other reasons since 2018 and overall five of the nine chemicals retain EU approval today. A spokesperson for Syngenta, which commissioned two DNT studies on abamectin in 2005 and 2007, as well as studies on two other pesticides, said: “Syngenta has complied with all EU data requests and provided relevant study data in accordance with regulatory requirements.” The spokesperson said the abamectin DNT studies were not submitted to EU authorities in an application for approval that was completed successfully in 2008 because the studies had been conducted for its US regulatory application and were not a requirement in the EU at the time. He said these studies were not considered to provide any new toxicological information. However, the Efsa spokesperson said: “The [DNT] studies were used to derive health-based safety levels for consumer and operator exposure.” A spokesperson for Bayer said: “At all times, we submitted the necessary studies required by the regulations at the time. For all three active ingredients [cited in the new research], the studies would not have changed the authorities’ risk assessment.” Nissan Chemical Corporation said it had submitted the DNT study for its pesticide pyridaben, completed in 2007, to EU regulatory authorities in February 2023. Mie and Rudén said the study has the potential to impact the regulation of the chemical, which is still approved in the EU. Japanese company ISK said it had submitted a 2005 DNT study on their pesticide fluazinam to EU authorities in 2020 and said it had not been required to do so beforehand. Efsa said the study was now being evaluated as part of the assessment of whether to renew the pesticide’s approval. None of the companies said they had submitted justifications for exemption from the need to submit existing studies, though some said other DNT studies had been submitted. Reforms proposed by Mie and Rudén to ensure all toxicity studies are submitted to EU regulatory authorities include cross-checking datasets with counterparts in other countries, such as the US EPA. “The rules should also be revised to ensure that non-disclosure of toxicity studies carries a significant legal risk for pesticide companies,” they said. Apolline Roger, a lawyer at ClientEarth, contrasted the lack of penalties for non-disclosure of toxicity studies with those imposed for breaches of EU data protection and competition laws, which can lead to fines of significant percentages of a company’s annual turnover. “You don’t have [penalties] like that for this process, even though what is at stake is the dispersion of potentially very harmful substances in the environment, and therefore in our food, water and bodies,” she said. “What does it say about us when we place a higher value on digital data and consumer protection than on health and the environment?” Currently, pesticide safety studies are commissioned and paid for by the companies. Mie and Rudén suggested the studies should be commissioned by regulatory authorities, to prevent conflicts of interest, with the costs being recovered from the companies. “[Mie and Rudén] are really finding the root of the issue when they say studies should not be made by the companies,” said Roger. “It’s the elephant in the room.” The Efsa spokesperson said: “In the EU regulatory system for pesticides, the burden of proof of safety lies with the company that seeks to place their product on the market.” Tougher EU rules on the notification of safety studies became applicable from March 2021, meaning companies now have to notify the authorities of all studies commissioned and cannot withhold studies even if they are considered to have found no adverse findings. However, Angeliki Lysimachou, head of science and policy at Pesticide Action Network Europe, said: “That means that all the pesticides already in the market won’t be examined until their reapproval comes up, which could take 10 or 15 years, sometimes more.” In the meantime, the pesticides remain approved for use, she said. Rudén said: “There’s no reason we are aware of to believe that withholding evidence is limited to DNT studies, or limited to pesticides.” She said the cases of tobacco and PFAS – “forever chemicals” – were previous examples of where companies withheld knowledge about toxicity from the public.

Guardian Australia is tracking progress in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and documenting the consequences of the global heating that has already occurred. The charts below tell the story in detail, covering historic and estimated future emissions, how Australia compares with other countries, how much greenhouse gas the country exports, and how much longer Australia has left to get to zero emissions and meet the landmark Paris agreement targets. They have been updated following the release of the quarterly update of Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory on 31 May 2023. Australia’s ‘fair share’ of future emissions The carbon budget countdown clock shows how long is left until Australia has emitted its “fair share” of future greenhouse gas emissions, if it stays on its current trajectory. It is based on the emissions trend and does not take into account changes in government policy. There are calculations for limiting global heating to 1.5C and 2C, the two goals included in the Paris agreement. Scientists warn there is a substantial difference in likely damage from climate change between 1.5C and 2C of heating. This chart presents the information in the countdown clock in another way. It tallies Australia’s estimated emissions since 1850 and shows what different 2030 targets mean for staying within different carbon budgets. The government’s 43% target is likely to push Australia beyond its fair share of an emissions budget to avoid 1.5C by later this decade. This chart shows the trajectory of Australia’s emissions since 1990, and what meeting different targets would mean if reductions were made in a straight line between now and 2030 or 2050. It shows a 0.4% decrease in emissions in the year to December 2022, mainly due an ongoing decline in carbon pollution from electricity generation. But emissions from transport increased as Covid-19 lockdowns ended. Agriculture emissions also rose as livestock numbers and crop production increased. The latest inventory says emissions are down 24.7% since 2005. This is a significant change since the last inventory, published in February, which said national emissions were down 21.4% down over that period. The inventory says this change is due to new estimates of emissions from what is known as LuluCF (land use, land use change and forestry). The picture changes significantly if you exclude emissions from LuluCF. The chart excluding emissions from land use shows that nearly all of the drop in national emissions since 2005 is due to a reduction in agricultural land-clearing and forestry. These changes were not due to national climate policies or attempts to cut emissions. They were due to state government decisions and a decline in the market for native forest logging. Both land-clearing and forestry continue on significant scales, but the greenhouse gas accounts reflect that they have reduced since 2005. Emissions from the rest of the economy – mainly fossil fuel industries – are down only 1.5% since 2005. Emissions in some parts of the economy have increased significantly. The next chart shows the change in emissions in different sectors since 2005. The next chart shows an estimate of how much other countries emit when they burn Australian fossil fuels. China and Japan have been Australia’s biggest markets for coal and gas, but China has recently had an informal ban on importing Australian coal. Emissions from burning Australia’s black coal are mostly not reflected in national emissions accounts. The bulk of the coal is sold and burnt overseas, as the following chart shows: How Australia compares to the world Australia’s minimum emissions reduction target for 2030 has increased since the change of government, and how it compares with other developed countries. It remains behind most other similar countries. This chart shows how emissions have changed year-by-year from some developed countries since 2000. Emissions from land use changes – LuluCF – are not included. Red denotes increases and blue shows decreases. Australia’s emissions mostly increased, or stayed about the same, until Covid-19 hit. This chart shows how much different countries emit per capita. The deeper the purple, the higher the pollution. The consequences of global heating The graph below shows the change in average Australian temperatures since early last century. The Bureau of Meteorology says the temperature across the country prior to the ongoing La Niña events was 1.4C hotter than pre-industrial times. Finally, here is a look at some recent extreme events that were more likely to occur, or more likely to be severe, due to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations: This article is being regularly updated to reflect new data releases. Any significant corrections made to this or previous versions of the article will be footnoted in line with the Guardian’s editorial policy. Notes and methods: Emissions values are based on tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases (AR5 values). Carbon clock uses the “fair share” carbon budget as a baseline, originally calculated as 10,400,000,000 tonnes of CO2-e between 2013 and 2050. Guardian Australia uses the quarterly National Greenhouse Gas Inventories to calculate emissions since 2021, creating a daily average from the previous year to calculate how much longer before the fair share threshold is breached. Carbon clock uses one second ticks based on the greenhouse gas emissions from the previous year. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions by country are based on the latest release of the Global Carbon Budget from the Global Carbon Project. Estimated combustion greenhouse gas emissions from Australian fossil fuels are calculated using production and export volumes from the Australian Resources and Energy Quarterly. Domestic consumption of black coal is estimated by subtracting annual exports from annual production. Volumes of fossil fuel exports are converted into energy units using factors from the Australian Energy Statistics. Emissions factors for energy from fossil fuels are calculated using figures from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Thanks to Tim Baxter for providing feedback on several graphics.

The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank have collectively pumped $32.85bn into fossil fuel projects – almost entirely linked to oil and gas production or power generation – over the same period, the report says. Jubilee Australia and ActionAid, which compiled the Hidden Cash for Fossils report, are urging the Albanese government to join more than 30 countries, including the US and the UK, in signing an international agreement to stop funding fossil fuel developments and to use their influence on multilateral development banks to do the same. Fyfe Strachan, the land and inclusive development director at Jubilee Australia Research Centre, said Australia was a major shareholder in the three development banks. “We have a significant influence and say over the work these banks do and that comes with a level of responsibility over the actions of those banks,” she said. The report looked at Australia’s capital contributions in establishing the banks and regular financial top ups. Australia’s shareholding translated to $828m when it came to the banks’ overall financing for fossil fuel projects. “You can’t hide behind the fact that we can’t trace [that contribution] to specific projects,” said Strachan. “Using aid money to finance new fossil fuel projects jeopardises the Paris agreement goals.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup All three development banks have made progress in reducing their funding of fossil fuels and have committed to bringing their operations in line with the global Paris climate agreement, the report notes. But loopholes exist in the commitments from the banks. There is a lack of transparency around the flow of funds, with some commitments continuing to allow financing of gas projects. Dr Susan Engel, an associate professor at the University of Wollongong and an expert on international development banks, said the investments of the banks – as well as the organisations themselves – help set global agendas, including on the climate crisis. She said: “I think Australia is under pressure on this and there’s a lot of concern that it should be more responsible to our Pacific island neighbours that are feeling climate change most rapidly.” The report recommends the Australian government develops an investment strategy that would rule out international financing for fossil fuel projects. At last year’s climate talks in Egypt, the energy minister, Chris Bowen, said international development banks needed to be “wholeheartedly committed” to accelerating a transition to renewable energy. “We have a moral imperative and driving need for our institutions to work with countries across the developed and developing world, not only to reduce emissions, but to respond to a changing climate and its economic impacts on nations,” he said. On Wednesday a group of more than 20 environment and aid groups including ActionAid, Jubilee Australia, Greenpeace, Oxfam Australia and the Australian Conservation Foundation wrote to Bowen and the trade minister, Don Farrell, asking them to sign the international Glasgow statement. That statement, released during the 2021 Glasgow climate talks, says signatories will “end new direct public support for the international unabated fossil fuel energy sector” and also push that position through their roles on the boards of multilateral development banks. Strachan said it made no sense for Australia to hold ambitions to be a “renewable energy superpower” while refusing to sign the statement. Financing gas projects locked countries into “an expensive and polluting form of energy for decades” as renewables became cheaper, she said. Michelle Higelin of ActionAid said Australia signing the Glasgow statement could drive more investment in renewable energy the world over. “The climate crisis is having a devastating impact on women in the Asia-Pacific. Australia needs to make sure that precious taxpayer dollars don’t help make the climate crisis worse.” Australia signing the Glasgow statement would see it join the US and UK to “catalyse greater global support for renewable energy,” she said. Analysis suggests 45% of the nations with voting power on the World Bank had already signed the Glasgow statement. Engel said Australia’s signature could help push the bank’s board to a majority that backed ending fossil fuel financing, even though China and Russia were still major holdouts. Australia has a director on the board of both the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. On the World Bank, Australia has a director working alternately with South Korea in a grouping representing Asia and the Pacific that includes 15 Pacific island states.

Going beyond climate disruption, the report by the Earth Commission group of scientists presents disturbing evidence that our planet faces growing crises of water availability, nutrient loading, ecosystem maintenance and aerosol pollution. These pose threats to the stability of life-support systems and worsen social equality. The study, which was published in Nature on Wednesday, is the most ambitious attempt yet to combine vital signs of planetary health with indicators of human welfare. Prof Johan Rockström, one of the lead authors, said: “It is an attempt to do an interdisciplinary science assessment of the entire people-planet system, which is something we must do given the risks we face. “We have reached what I call a saturation point where we hit the ceiling of the biophysical capacity of the Earth system to remain in its stable state. We are approaching tipping points, we are seeing more and more permanent damage of life-support systems at the global scale.” The Earth Commission, which was established by dozens of the world’s leading research institutions, wants the analysis to form the scientific backbone of the next generation of sustainability targets and practices, which extend beyond the current focus on climate to include other indices and environmental justice. It hopes that cities and businesses will adopt the targets as a way to measure the impact of their activities. The study sets out a series of “safe and just” benchmarks for the planet that can be compared to the vital signs for the human body. Instead of pulse, temperature and blood pressure, it looks at indicators such as water flow, phosphorus use and land conversion. The boundaries are based on a synthesis of previous studies by universities and UN science groups, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. The situation is grave in almost every category. Setting global benchmarks is challenging. For climate, the world has already adopted a target to keep global heating as low as possible between 1.5C to 2C above pre-industrial levels. The Earth Commission notes that this is a dangerous level because many people are already badly affected by the extreme heat, droughts and floods that come with the current level of about 1.2C. They say a safe and just climate target is 1C, which would require a massive effort to draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They note it is impossible to stabilise the climate without protecting ecosystems. To achieve this, the “safe and just” boundary is for 50to 60% of the world to be home to predominantly natural ecosystems. The reality, however, is that only 45to 50% of the planet has an intact ecosystem. In human-altered areas, such as farms, cities and industrial parks, the commission says at least 20 to 25% of the land needs to be devoted to semi-natural habitats such as parks, allotments and clusters of trees in order to maintain ecosystem services such as pollination, water quality regulation, pest and disease control, and the health and mental health benefits provided by access to nature. However, about two-thirds of altered landscapes fail to meet this goal. Another target is for aerosol pollution, which accumulates from car exhausts, factories, and coal, oil and gas power plants. At a global level, the report has focussed on minimising the imbalance of aerosol concentrations between the northern and southern hemispheres, which can disrupt the monsoon season and other weather patterns. At a local level, for example in cities, it follows the World Health Organization in establishing a boundary of 15 micrograms per cubic metre mean annual exposure to small particulate matter, known as PM2.5, which can damage the lungs and heart. This is an issue of social justice because poorer, often predominantly black communities tend to suffer the worst results as many are found in vulnerable areas. The benchmark for surface water is that no more than 20% of the flow of rivers and streams should be blocked in any catchment area because this leads to declining water quality and habit loss for freshwater species. This “safe boundary” has already been exceeded on a third of the world’s land by hydroelectric dams, drainage systems and construction. The story is similarly poor for groundwater systems, where the safe boundary is that aquifers are not depleted faster than they can be replenished. However, 47% of the world’s river basins are being run down at an alarming rate. This is a big problem in population centres such as Mexico City and areas of intensive agricultural such as the North China Plain. Nutrients are another area of concern because farmers in wealthier countries are spraying more nitrogen and phosphorus than the plants and land are able to absorb. This temporarily increases yields, but leads to runoffs into water systems that become suffocated by algae blooms and unhealthy for humans to drink. Global equity is the key here, the report says. Poorer nations need more fertilisers, while rich nations need to cut the surplus. Balanced out, the “safe and just boundary” in this case is a global surplus of 61m tonnes of nitrogen and about 6m tonnes of phosphorus. The authors say the planetary diagnosis is grim but not yet beyond hope, though the time for a remedy is running out. Joyeeta Gupta, the Earth Commission co-chair and professor of environment and development in the global south at the University of Amsterdam, said: “Our doctor would say the Earth is really quite sick right now in many areas. And this is affecting the people living on Earth. We must not just address symptoms, but also the causes.” David Obura, another member of the commission and director of coastal oceans research and development in the Indian Ocean, said the policy framework was already in place to get back within safe boundaries through the goals of existing UN climate and biodiversity agreements. But he stressed that consumption choices also needed to play an important role. “There are a number of medicines we can take, but we also need lifestyle changes – less meat, more water, and a more balanced diet,” he said. “It is possible to do it. Nature’s regenerative powers are robust … but we need a lot more commitment.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9c2', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/01/pressure-grows-on-albanese-government-to-end-native-forest-logging', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Pressure grows on Albanese government to end native forest logging', 'lead': 'Exclusive: Labor facing calls from 15 crossbenchers, as well as party insiders, to transition to plantation timber as part of reform to environmental laws', 'author': 'Paul Karp Chief political correspondent', 'datePublished': '2023-05-31 15:00:07', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563795', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/3a57888374e84261332af3681edb4b98aeaa9e7e/0_166_5000_3002/500.jpg', 'body': 'A group of 15 crossbench MPs and senators has written to the federal environment minister calling on the Albanese government to end native forest logging, as pressure also grows within Labor for it to do so. All seven teal independents, including Monique Ryan and Allegra Spender, the Greens, MP Andrew Wilkie and influential crossbench senator David Pocock have all called on Tanya Plibersek to end native forest logging in New South Wales and Tasmania as part of upcoming environmental law reform. The call follows Labor MP Josh Burns urging the government to “act to save our precious natural environment and native wildlife” ahead of the Victorian budget, which will end native forest logging from 2024. Labor’s Environment Action Network (Lean) is also pressing to end native forest logging and transition to 100% plantation timber, with 192 branches endorsing that call ahead of Labor’s national conference in August. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The crossbench letter, sent on Wednesday, argued that at the federal election millions of Australians voted to “lower our carbon emissions, care for our environment, and protect the futures of our children and grandchildren”. It noted that Victoria had become the “second Labor government after Western Australia to end native forest logging”. Last week, Plibersek told the lower house that Labor “believes that we need to protect more of what is precious, restore more of what is damaged and manage it better for the future”. While it is “important to have a forestry industry here in Australia” and Labor supports expanding plantation forestry, Plibersek noted native forests are “very important carbon sequestration providers, [and] they are very important habitat”. “So, we are determined to make sure, as we update the environment protection laws, that regional forest agreements come under new national environment standards.” The crossbench welcomed this commitment but said instead of “tinkering around the edges” the Albanese government should be “brave … by ending native forest logging nationally”. Ending the practice in NSW and Tasmania “will save as many additional carbon emissions as removing almost two million cars from the road each year”, the letter said. The crossbench acknowledged the “challenging” transition for workers and families involved in the logging industry, and called for an “orderly transition” to other opportunities in “responsible forest management, such as carbon offsetting, tourism, and bushfire protection”. Plibersek has said she will unveil Labor’s proposed reforms to the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act this year. Lean convener Felicity Wade said “with native forest logging driving extinctions, the industry in crisis, having over-cut for years and wildfires being fed by the disturbance logging creates, it’s time to recognise this is not a 21st-century industry. “Labor members across the country are joining with Lean in calling for a shift to a plantation-based industry creating high quality, sustainable value-added products.” On Saturday the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, told Guardian’s Australia Politics podcast his party was concerned the EPBC Act reforms will add “another layer of bureaucracy that closes down and slows down investment” in forestry. Littleproud accepted that the economics of native forest logging were “challenging” but accused the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, of “an ideological view without any practical understanding of the reality of the lives that he’s about to change” with the ban. If the Coalition opposes EPBC Act reforms, Labor may need support in the Senate from the Jacqui Lambie Network, which was highly critical of the government for excluding native logging projects from its national reconstruction fund. Earlier in May, Burns told Guardian Australia he “sincerely hopes to see the native forests that still exist preserved for conservation and recreation. “It’ll mean generations to come will have a sporting chance at seeing the endangered wildlife we are duty-bound to protect.” Labor also has internal stakeholders urging it not to ban native forest logging. Michael O’Connor, an official of the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining Energy Union representing timber workers, has warned against the cessation of the industry, saying it employs “thousands of workers” and is vital for the social fabric of many communities. Labor MP Brian Mitchell has said the government supports “a sustainable, well-managed native forestry sector, which supplies vital hardwoods and speciality timbers”.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9c3', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/31/australia-emissions-fell-04-in-2022-despite-increases-in-transport-and-agriculture-pollution', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Australia’s emissions fell 0.4% in 2022 despite increases in transport and agriculture pollution', 'lead': 'Inventory shows Australia has burned through 27% of emissions budget under Paris climate accord in 25% of allotted time', 'author': 'Peter Hannam', 'datePublished': '2023-05-31 09:42:12', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563816', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/c883ce21c5d3b8d8bfb00c204ec9ec9c818275ee/0_121_5184_3110/500.jpg', 'body': 'Australia’s carbon emissions edged lower in 2022 with reductions from the electricity sector partly countered by increases in pollution from transport and agriculture. The country’s emissions last year totalled 463.9m tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent (Mt CO2-e), down 0.4% or 2m tonnes from the previous year. Preliminary estimates for the year to 31 March 2023 indicated emissions totalled 464Mt CO2-e, or 0.2% lower on a rolling 12-month tally, the national greenhouse gas inventory shows. Between June 2005 and the end of 2022, carbon pollution dropped 24.7%, or slightly more than half the Albanese government’s 43% emissions reduction target by 2030. Australia’s total budget under the Paris climate agreement is 4.353bn tonnes of CO2-e, and so far it has burned through 27% of the total in 25% of the accord’s time period. Of the sectors, emissions from land use, land use changes and forestry decreased by the largest margin since June 2005, the government said. The reported drop of 179.1%, or 144.6Mt CO2-e, was “due to reductions in land clearing and native forest harvesting, increases in plantations and native vegetation, and improvements in soil carbon”. Some analysts, though, have questioned how the land sector can realistically be considered an ongoing carbon sink when land clearing in Queensland and NSW has increased in the past decade. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The reduction in emissions in the power sector is more clearcut, with a limited number of polluting sites closely monitored by regulators. Emissions from this industry have fallen 21.4% or 42.1Mt CO2-e since June 2005, although the sector continues to account for about a third of pollution. “After decades of strong growth, emissions peaked in 2009 and have since fallen 26.9%,” the inventory said. “This reflects accelerating renewables deployment and gradual displacement of coal as a fuel source.” Most other sectors of the economy have tended to increase emissions over time, such as so-called fugitive emissions from the fossil fuel industry. In 2022, though, heavy rainfall in New South Wales and Queensland curbed some coalmining output, resulting in a 1.7% drop, or 800,000 tonnes of CO2-e. Falling emissions from stationary energy, such as that used in manufacturing and gas heating in homes, all retreated in 2022, easing back 1.5% or 1.6Mt CO2-e. As Covid restrictions eased, transport emissions gained 4.9% or 4.4Mt CO2-e, last year, led by people taking more flights. Agriculture was another sector emitting more, with the total up 2.6% or 2Mt CO2-e, as livestock numbers and crop production bounced back to pre-drought levels, the government said.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9c5', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/31/country-diary-down-on-the-floor-with-the-solitary-bees', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country Diary: Down on the floor with the solitary bees | Jan Miller', 'lead': '<strong>Holywell, Flintshire:</strong> In my attempts to make my garden more suitable for Mediterranean herbs, I created the conditions for these fascinating insects', 'author': 'Jan Miller', 'datePublished': '2023-05-31 04:30:15', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563851', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/61ceadd914ae699a25900e18c82f390be583992b/0_50_1024_614/500.jpg', 'body': 'I’m lying on my front on the moist, mossy lawn, the sun warming my back. Around me swallows are swooping in and out of the barn while dandelions, lady’s smock and cowslips attract the butterflies and bees. But down here, my attention is focused under the box hedges of my herb garden. I am watching volcanoes form. Not the sort that spew hot lava, but small cones of the gritty soil with a vent in the top about the size of my little fingernail. These are the entrances to the breeding burrows of the tawny mining bee, Andrena fulva. They are just one of the 240 species of solitary bees in Britain, and are just as important for pollination as the one species of honeybee. Each has different shaped mouthparts, which have evolved alongside flowers with different access routes to their nectar so that the plants are more likely to be pollinated from the same species. And you don’t have to farm the solitaries. This type needs only fine, sandy soil so they can dig deep burrows (and surprisingly quickly too with their tiny legs). They make side chambers and lay one egg in each, with a small supply of nectar and pollen. Then they’re sealed up and the larvae left to hibernate over winter, until they dig their way out the next spring. I could never grow Mediterranean herbs such as thyme, sage, oregano, orpine or lavender in my damp garden until a few years ago, when I had this square dug out and filled with limestone hardcore. Unwittingly, I had also made the perfect place for these mining bees to breed. It also helped that this was under the bit of lawn where we once had the kids’ sandpit. Meanwhile, the osmia mining bees – the red mason and the leafcutter bees you can buy nesting houses for in garden shops – are a different species.

The agreement struck between Joe Biden and Republicans who control the House of Representatives states the Mountain Valley pipeline is “required in the national interest” and should be issued its necessary permits within 21 days and be shielded from legal challenge by those who object to it. Environmentalists reacted in outrage at the deal, arguing the 300-mile (480km) pipeline, which will bring fracked gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia, will endanger hundreds of waterways, threaten landscapes including the nearby Appalachian trail and worsen the climate crisis. “Singling out the Mountain Valley pipeline for approval in a vote about our nation’s credit limit is an egregious act,” said Peter Anderson, Virginia policy director at Appalachian Voices, a campaign group that has charted hundreds of environmental violations by the project across the two states. “By attempting to suspend the rules for a pipeline company that has repeatedly polluted communities’ water and flouted the conditions in its permits, the president and Congress would deny basic legal protections, procedural fairness and environmental justice to communities along the pipeline’s path.” The pipeline was recently provided a key approval by the federal government to go through a stretch of forest but is currently stymied by court action that has dogged it for years. Mountain Valley has just 20 miles (30km) left to complete but is several years behind schedule due to opposition from green groups and nearby residents who risk having their land taken for the project. However, Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator, coal baron and the Senate’s leading beneficiary of campaign donations from gas pipeline interests, has vigorously lobbied for the pipeline’s construction and appears to have prevailed in his quest. Manchin, a centrist Democrat, is considered a valued swing vote in an evenly divided Senate. “I am pleased speaker [Kevin] McCarthy and his leadership team see the tremendous value in completing the [Mountain Valley pipeline] to increase domestic energy production and drive down costs across America and especially in West Virginia,” Manchin said in a statement that did not mention Biden. “I am proud to have fought for this critical project and to have secured the bipartisan support necessary to get it across the finish line.” The White House has framed the debt ceiling deal as one that has protected Biden’s key climate achievements, such as the numerous provisions for clean energy support in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, which Republicans were keen to strip away in negotiations. But the agreement does not include any measures to accelerate the expansion of electricity transmission, a crucial factor in whether the shift to renewables will actually materialize, while acceding to Republican demands to curtail the environmental reviews of developments such as oil and gas pipelines. Under the deal, reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act, the US’s first national environmental law, will be limited to just two years for federal projects. Environmental groups, already angered by Biden’s ongoing embrace of large fossil fuel projects, such as the recently approved Willow oil drilling operation in Alaska, said these provisions mean that Democrats should block the debt deal when it is voted upon in Congress this week. “President Biden made a colossal error in negotiating a deal that sacrifices the climate and working families,” said Jean Su, energy justice program director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Congress should reject these poison pills and pass a clean debt ceiling bill.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9c7', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/ban-on-moving-oak-trees-due-to-invasive-oak-processionary-moth', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Invasive moth species spreading across south-east England, say experts', 'lead': 'Government curbs transfer of trees to and from affected areas to limit spread of rash-causing oak processionary moths', 'author': 'Helena Horton Environment reporter', 'datePublished': '2023-05-30 13:07:43', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563899', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/5ef08917ce71fe05cf6d9c52c61012f1bafee85c/0_0_5668_3401/500.jpg', 'body': 'The government has introduced new legislation controlling the movement of oak trees in south-east England due to a rise in the numbers of a toxic, invasive moth species. The oak processionary moth was first spotted in Kew Gardens, in south-west London, in 2006 after the eggs were imported on an oak from Europe. The insects, whose caterpillars produce tiny hairs that can cause allergic reactions in humans, feed on the leaves of oak trees. Tough biosecurity measures, including the swift treatment of outbreaks and a ban on moving oak trees to or from affected areas, meant that at first the moth was mostly confined to the capital. It expanded its range by about two miles a year until 2016, when its spread accelerated to five miles a year and it was spotted outside London, according to the Forestry Commission. The moth now officially has strongholds in the south-east. The commission has put a buffer zone in place which stretches from Colchester to Oxford and Eastbourne to Southampton, with cases recorded throughout the zone. In the zone, there will be an annual programme of surveillance and control, which involves detecting the moth and treating infested oak trees, while monitoring trees in close proximity. People who own an infested oak tree in the zone may be issued with a statutory plant health notice, which requires them to take action such as treating and monitoring affected trees and the trees around them. There is also a ban on the movement of large oak trees from the buffer zone into areas free from the pest, unless the trees have been grown throughout their life in a site with complete physical protection against the oak processionary moth and have been inspected at appropriate times and found to be free of the insects. The moths’ spread, according to experts, is moving strongly through Surrey and towards Hampshire. Andrew Hoppit, the oak processionary moth project manager at the Forestry Commission, said it had been incredibly difficult to contain cases of the moth, and it was unlikely that its spread would be stopped. Hoppit told the Times: “It’s a little brown moth which flies at night-time and is jolly difficult to find.” He said the best result would be to “dampen” the rate at which it spreads rather than trying to stop the spread. The caterpillars are thought of as pests because they feed on the leaves of several species of oak trees, with trees vulnerable to being stripped bare by large populations. This weakens the tree, meaning it could be more affected by other pests and diseases, and more susceptible to other issues including drought. The insects are hard to spot, as the caterpillars are only about 2mm long when they emerge in spring, and tend to remain high in the trees until they are older and larger. Once they are fully grown, they travel further down, usually moving nose to tail in a procession. Not only do they affect the health of oak trees, but they can also be harmful to people and animals as their itchy hairs can cause rashes, eye and throat irritation, and in rare cases breathing difficulties. In some cases, they can cause cause severe allergic reactions, with repeated exposure to the moth a risk factor in worsening symptoms. The main treatment is a pesticide sprayed on trees, but this can harm other insects including useful pollinators. Experts have suggested encouraging the moth’s natural predator, the parasitic fly Carcelia iliaca, by growing plants it likes to feed on such as cow parsley. Prof Nicola Spence, the UK’s chief plant health officer, said: “Our oak trees are an iconic part of our British landscape. Reporting any sightings of oak processionary moth to the Forestry Commission will minimise the pest’s spread and reduce the damaging impact it poses to tree health. “The caterpillars and their nests can also cause irritation when touched by members of the public. As such, I would advise that those living in London and the surrounding areas avoid the pest.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9c8', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/delta-air-lines-lawsuit-carbon-neutrality-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': ' Delta Air Lines faces lawsuit over $1bn carbon neutrality claim', 'lead': 'US airline pledged to go carbon neutral but plaintiffs say it is relying on offsets that do almost nothing to mitigate global heating', 'author': 'Patrick Greenfield', 'datePublished': '2023-05-30 13:00:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563916', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e21a394d9d28a6a54911648c8294d23ad6408a3f/0_100_3000_1800/500.jpg', 'body': 'Delta Air Lines is facing a lawsuit over its $1bn carbon neutrality claim which plaintiffs say is “false and misleading” as it relies on offsets that do little to mitigate global heating. In February 2020, the US airline announced plans to go carbon neutral, pledging $1bn to mitigate all greenhouse gas emissions from its business worldwide over the next decade. It included plans to purchase carbon credits generated from conserving rainforest, wetlands and grasslands along with decreasing the use of jet fuel and increasing plane efficiency. The new legal action, filed in California on Tuesday, targets Delta’s statement that it is “the world’s first carbon-neutral airline”, a claim it has made in adverts, LinkedIn posts, in-flight napkins and comments by company executives, according to the lawsuit. The class-action lawsuit says Delta’s carbon neutrality claim is demonstrably false as it heavily relies on junk offsets that do nothing to counteract the climate crisis. It alleges that customers would have purchased Delta tickets believing they had no impact on the environment and many would not have bought them without the carbon neutrality claim. A Delta spokesperson said: “This lawsuit is without legal merit. Delta is a vigorous advocate for more sustainable aviation, adopting industry-leading climate goals as we work towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Delta committed to carbon neutrality in March 2020, and since 31 March 2022, has fully transitioned its focus away from carbon offsets toward decarbonisation of our operations, focusing our efforts on investing in sustainable aviation fuel, renewing our fleet for more fuel-efficient aircraft and implementing operational efficiencies.” “The language carbon neutral is so provocative,” says Krikor Kouyoumdjian, a partner with the legal firm Haderlein and Kouyoumdjian LLP which is bringing the case. “When companies say: ‘Don’t worry about our emissions, they’re sorted,’ they are communicating complacency. They are letting consumers pay to feel better and not have to worry about the impact of their consumption. But that is counterfactual to reality. It is not something that you can pay away. “When I hear ‘carbon neutral’, I think you’re not doing anything wrong, you’re not hurting the environment in any way. It’s like you don’t exist. That’s what the words mean to any rational person: that we can participate in your business without any guilt. Most of us who care about the environment walk around with this giant cloud of guilt that our very existence hurts the environment in a bunch of ways.” The case argues that there is a market premium for green products and that Delta has profited from a misleading environmental claim. It cites scientific and journalistic evidence that there are deep flaws with carbon credits from the unregulated voluntary market that Delta has purchased for its environmental claims. In January, a nine-month investigation by the Guardian, the German weekly Die Zeit and the investigative group SourceMaterial found Verra rainforest credits used by Disney, Shell, Gucci and other big corporations were largely worthless, often based on stopping the destruction of rainforests that were not threatened, according to independent studies. The lawsuit against Delta mentions the investigation. Verra strongly disputed the findings. Haderlein and Kouyoumdjian said they wanted the company to drop the carbon neutrality claim and explain the full scale of the pollution that their business causes. “The voluntary carbon offset market cannot meaningfully guarantee carbon neutrality from a company in the way it’s currently being operated. The market is replete with severe methodological errors that appear both intentional and unintentional. In our opinion, it’s frankly reckless to predicate a company’s ESG strategy on climate change on the basis of the purchase of these offsets,” says attorney Jonathan Haderlein. “This is more than a climate change case. This is also a business case. People are paying more for these greener products. If a company like Delta is raking that premium in by claiming they do it first and then doing a huge advertising blitz to try to get people flying again, we think that’s unfair to other companies that are buying higher-quality offsets or doing far better sustainability. And frankly, unfair to consumers.” At the time Delta launched its plans to go carbon neutral in 2020, its chief executive, Ed Bastian, said: “There’s no challenge we face that is in greater need of innovation than environmental sustainability, and we know there is no single solution. We are digging deep into the issues, examining every corner of our business, engaging experts, building coalitions, fostering partnerships and driving innovation.” The new lawsuit comes amid a wider regulatory crackdown on green claims in the UK and Europe. In New York, Evian is being sued over its carbon neutrality claim which relies on offsets. Danone, who own the water brand, has argued it should be thrown out and say the case “defies science and common sense”. A judge will now decide whether or not to progress the case.

The government nature watchdog has updated the status of the river from “unfavourable-improving” to “unfavourable-declining”, meaning its condition is poor – and worsening. The assessment shows the river, which flows for 155 miles from mid-Wales to the Severn estuary in England, has experienced declines in key species such as the Atlantic salmon and white-clawed crayfish. Previous studies have linked its decline – the river has been pictured over the years going from clear and full of wildlife to the colour of pea soup – to intensive chicken farming on the catchment. This is because the poultry reared in the area produce large amounts of manure, which contains nutrients including phosphorus. Much of this is spread on the land, which can result in the phosphorus it contains entering the river. The Wildlife Trusts, which manages nature reserves across the Wye catchment, has expressed concern at the downgrading of its status and urged the government to take action. It is calling for ministers in England and Wales to place an immediate policy moratorium on any new or extended intensive livestock production units (poultry, cattle and pig) in the Wye catchment. It is also asking for farmers and supermarkets to work with nature charities to put an end to the pollution, and for farmers in the area to be rewarded for providing public goods and enabled to diversify into regenerative and sustainable methods of production which cause less pollution. Joan Edwards, the director of public affairs at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “That the Wye is in even worse condition now will come as no surprise to the people that love and live near it. But this new admission represents a shocking failure by the agencies and authorities in Wales and England that are supposed to protect this once beautiful river. “Wider research shows that farm pollution is the main cause of its decline – that’s why the authorities must enforce the law wherever the causes of pollution are clear. It’s time to prevent more chicken sheds from being built and ensure that all farmers are rewarded for nature-friendly, cleaner food production methods.” Thérèse Coffey, the environment secretary, said: “The River Wye is clearly struggling and it is vital that we turn the tide on its decline. As I set out in our plan for water, we need local plans catchment by catchment, community by community to tackle issues that are affecting water quality. Bringing people together from the local communities, it is clear we have a common goal. We do all need to work together at a greater pace and with purpose to actively support our farmers and food producers to produce food sustainably and reduce pollution.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9ca', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/england-vital-hedges-cuts-funding-farmers-brexit', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'England’s vital hedges under threat from cuts to funding, farmers say', 'lead': 'Transition to post-Brexit farming payments means scheme to protect hedgerows could be lost', 'author': 'Helena Horton Environment reporter', 'datePublished': '2023-05-30 11:00:00', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563953', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0b6317f6848dd61080390c31d70b4bdfa0b6d76c/0_299_6048_3627/500.jpg', 'body': 'Hedgerows in England are under threat, farmers and nature groups have warned, as the government prepares to cut funding that protects them. Hedges are vital habitat for many species, providing food and shelter for mammals, birds and pollinators, with the EU paying farmers under its farming subsidy scheme to have them on their land. But in the transition to post-Brexit farming payments, which are aimed at paying land managers to protect and conserve nature, a scheme that encouraged the laying and maintenance of hedges, could be lost. To qualify for the basic payments scheme (BPS), which paid land managers per hectare, they had to meet standards including decreeing that farmers did not plough to the base of hedgerows, thus damaging roots, or use fertilisers or pesticides within 2 metres of them. The rules also stated that hedgerows were not cut between 1 March and 31 August without good cause, because this is when birds nest in them. In advance of these payments being phased out – farmers are getting less of the BPS money every year and instead have the chance to “top up” with new environmental land-management payments – the government is dropping all these requirements at the end of the year. The RSPB has called for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to keep the hedge protections, or replace them with another hedge-protecting policy. Alice Groom, the head of sustainable land use policy at the charity, said: “The future of over 547,000km of hedgerow alongside agricultural land is now under threat. As spaces for wildlife we believe hedgerows are an essential part of creating a vibrant countryside and should be recognised as part of the effort to halt species decline in England, as well as helping to keep carbon locked up. “So we are asking Defra to commit to the protection of our precious hedgerows and ensure that they continue to have the basic protections as afforded under the basic payments scheme.” Other charities have criticised the lack of care for hedges. Tom Fyans, the director of campaigns and policy at CPRE, the countryside charity, said: “It’s simply not good enough. The anger levels of farmers and land managers trying their best to look after our environment are rising fast because the government is increasingly seen as a hindrance rather than a help. “Defra has been widely criticised for its lack of ambition when it comes to protections for nature. Worse, it now looks like even the insufficient protections we do have are going to be lost through sheer carelessness. “There was genuine goodwill back in January when the government announced plans to plant 30,000 miles of new hedgerows. Ministers are in danger of squandering this positive momentum because, despite setting hedgerow targets, there is so far no policy that might actually ensure they are hit. “Now we find out one of the few protections hedgerows do enjoy is about to become null and void.” Farmers have also complained and urged the government to act. Martin Lines, the chair of the Nature Friendly Farming Network, said: “Hedgerows risk being left with less protection as we shift to a new system of farm payments. Hedgerows bring numerous benefits, from carbon sequestration and natural pest control to flood mitigation, but they are also a part of our countryside’s heritage. “Removing basic hedgerow protections runs counter to the need to secure ecosystem functionality in ways that improve farming’s resilience. A move to a system of public money for public goods will only be successful if it’s underpinned by a clear regulatory baseline that protects the natural assets that our food production relies upon.” A Defra spokesperson said: “Hedgerows are an important ecological building block in our landscapes – maintaining the distinctive character of our countryside, improving local air quality, and providing crucial habitats for wildlife. Our countryside stewardship schemes are already helping farmers maintain and restore over 10,000km of existing hedgerow and plant an additional 4,000km of hedges right across the country. “We are also introducing a new sustainable farming initiative hedgerow standard this year to pay farmers to assess the condition of hedgerows and manage them in a way that will work for wildlife and improve biodiversity. And we will shortly be consulting on how to best further protect them as we phase out the [EU] common agricultural policy.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9cb', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/rock-flour-greenland-capture-significant-co2-study', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Rock ‘flour’ from Greenland can capture significant CO2, study shows', 'lead': 'Powder produced by ice sheets could be used to help tackle climate crisis when spread on farm fields', 'author': 'Damian Carrington Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-05-30 10:44:59', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563970', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0002a9c26d35b41779216f2a40ebeebce2775cab/0_174_3776_2266/500.jpg', 'body': 'Rock “flour” produced by the grinding under Greenland’s glaciers can trap climate-heating carbon dioxide when spread on farm fields, research has shown for the first time. Natural chemical reactions break down the rock powder and lead to CO2 from the air being fixed in new carbonate minerals. Scientists believe measures to speed up the process, called enhanced rock weathering (ERW), have global potential and could remove billions of tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere, helping to prevent extreme global heating. Soil fertility naturally depends on rock weathering to provide essential nutrients, so enhancing the process delivers an extra benefit. Spreading the Greenland rock flour on fields in Denmark, including those growing barley for the Carlsberg brewery, significantly increased yields. Greenland’s giant ice sheet produces 1bn tonnes a year of rock flour, which flows as mud from under the glaciers. This means the potential supply of rock flour is essentially unlimited, the researchers said, and removing some would have very little effect on the local environment. The weathering process is relatively slow, taking decades to complete, but the researchers said ERW could make a meaningful difference in meeting the key target of net zero emissions by 2050. Phasing out the burning of fossil fuels remains the most critical climate action, but most scientists agree that ways of removing CO2 from the atmosphere will also be needed to avoid the worst effects of the climate crisis. “If you want something to have a global impact, it has to be very simple,” said Prof Minik Rosing at the University of Copenhagen, who was part of the research team. “You can’t have very sophisticated things with all kinds of hi-tech components. So the simpler the better, and nothing is simpler than mud.” He added: “Above all this is a scalable solution. Rock flour has been piling up in Greenland for the past 8,000 years or so. The whole Earth’s agricultural areas could be covered with this, if you wished.” Other researchers are investigating the use of mechanically ground rock for ERW. “But unlike other sources, glacial rock flour does not need any processing,” said Dr Christiana Dietzen, also at the University of Copenhagen. The rock flour weathers extremely slowly in the cold conditions in Greenland, but the process speeds up when it is spread in warmer places. The research on the CO2 uptake of Greenland rock flour, published in the International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control, estimated that 250kg of CO2 can be trapped per tonne of rock flour. After three years in soil in Denmark, the researchers found about 8% of this had been achieved. The scientists also calculated that 27m tonnes of CO2 could be captured if all farmland in Denmark was spread with the rock flour, an amount similar to the country’s total annual CO2 emissions. Another study by the same team, published in the journal Nutrient Cycling in Agroecosystems, showed increases in yields of maize and potatoes of 24% and 19% respectively after rock flour was spread in Denmark. Dietzen hopes the first commercial applications will be spread within three years. The team is also running experiments in less fertile soils, in Ghana, where even greater increases in maize yield have been seen. “In environments like Ghana, the fertiliser benefit alone may be enough reason to import glacial rock flour,” Dietzen said, though the impact of transporting the rock flour long distances from Greenland would have to be weighed up. Other ERW research has used mechanically ground basalt and a 2020 study estimated that treating about half of global farmland with this could capture 2bn tonnes of CO2 each year, equivalent to the combined emissions of Germany and Japan. Prof David Beerling at the University of Sheffield, who led the 2020 work, said basalt had significant advantages. Its chemical composition absorbs CO2 faster than glacial rock flour, may increase crop yields by more and it is widely available close to many farming areas. “We need all the weapons we can muster in the fight against climate change and my sense is that glacial rock flour could be a useful one,” he said. “But it is not a gamechanger.” However, the rock flour is much finer than the ground basalt and so exposes more surface area to weathering. The advantages and disadvantages of both types of rock dust are still being studied. The Danish group is planning trials in Australia and assessing the energy requirements of shipping. Beerling’s team expects to publish results of yield gains in corn following basalt application in the US in the near future. “I don’t think it has to be one or the other. I think there’s probably room for both,” said Rosing. Other proposed ways of pulling CO2 from the atmosphere include using technology to capture it directly from the air, or growing energy crops, burning them to produce electricity and then burying the CO2 emissions. The 2020 study suggested ERW would be less expensive than either and, unlike energy crops, does not compete with food for land. Greenland is usually in the news because of the huge and accelerating melting of its ice cap, which is driving up sea level. Rosing, who is originally from Greenland, said: “It would be much nicer for the nation to be part of the [climate] solution, rather than just a symptom of the problem.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9cc', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/pfas-kos-protein-powder-environmental-research-center', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Consumer watchdog says KOS protein powder contains toxic PFAS', 'lead': 'The Environmental Research Center says it tested five products and found toxic ‘forever chemicals’ linked to serious disease', 'author': 'Tom Perkins', 'datePublished': '2023-05-30 10:00:33', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.563988', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e9e1e740c42e618e4dae76b86b7099b146e16635/0_187_5616_3370/500.jpg', 'body': 'KOS Nature-Powered Organic Plant Protein drinks and powders contain toxic “forever chemicals”, a recent filing with the California department of justice charges. The filing, made by the Environmental Research Center (ERC), a San Diego-based consumer protection nonprofit, states that its testing found PFOA, a dangerous PFAS compound, in five KOS products. It also alleges KOS is violating California’s Proposition 65 law, which among other provisions requires companies to alert consumers when toxic chemicals are used in goods. “[KOS] violated Proposition 65 because they failed to provide persons ingesting these products with appropriate warnings that they are being exposed to this chemical,” the filing states. The ERC and KOS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. PFAS are a class of about 15,000 compounds typically used to make products resistant to water, stains and heat. They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down, and are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health problems. The filing states the non-profit found PFOA in KOS Nature-Powered Organic Plant Protein chocolate and vanilla flavors in two package sizes, as well as one package size of chocolate chip mint flavor. The document did not provide the level at which PFOA was detected, but the Environmental Protection Agency found this year that virtually no level of exposure to the compound in drinking water is safe. KOS powders and drinks are sold at Walmart, Whole Foods, CVS, Walgreens, Target and other national retailers. The filing demands that the company and state regulators recall the products, add label warnings alerting consumers to the presence of PFOA and pay for health monitoring for those who have consumed the product. It also calls for fines to be imposed. “Such a resolution will prevent further unwarned consumer exposures to [PFOA], as well as an expensive and time consuming litigation,” the filing states. The 27 April document is a notice of violation, and the ERC can sue in state court after 60 days if the demands are not met. It is unclear how PFAS got in the powders, though it is highly unlikely they were intentionally added. Food packaging can contain the chemicals, or they could have been in contaminated ingredients added to the product mix. The filing comes after two separate federal suits earlier this year alleged that Bolthouse Farms smoothies and Coca-Cola’s Simply Tropical juices also contained PFAS and deceived customers with claims that its products were “all-natural”. Water is considered to be a main exposure route to PFAS, but researchers have recently found contaminated food and drinks to be more of a risk than previously thought. Though the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seven years ago secured from industry a voluntary phase-out of PFOA in food packaging, it has taken little action to address PFAS contamination, and has not set limits for the chemicals in food. It annually tests some food products for the chemicals, but public health advocates have charged that the agency developed a methodology that ignores dangerous levels. The lack of regulatory action has left lawsuits that target false advertising as one of the limited pressure points available to force companies to address PFAS contamination. “This lawsuit is another example of organizations stepping up when the FDA drops the ball,” said Tom Neltner, director of safer chemicals with the Environmental Defense Fund. “Despite the evidence that PFOA is still showing up in food from a myriad of other non-food uses, the agency has not set an action level for PFOA and other PFAS to protect food from contamination.”'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9cd', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/they-could-disappear-overnight-rare-italian-deer-make-long-journey-to-survival-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘They could disappear overnight’: rare Italian deer make long journey to survival', 'lead': 'Under an ambitious conservation plan, 60 Mesola red deer are being moved from northern Italy to Calabria, where it is hoped they will thrive and multiply', 'author': 'Lorenzo Colantoni.

Small openings in the crates reveal the fearful looks of stocky deer, their antlers sawn off to prevent injury during transport. It will be a long trip, more than 1,000km (620 miles) and almost 20 hours of driving to Calabria in southern Italy, where they will be released. The 20 animals in the crates are some of the 300 remaining Italian or Mesola red deer (Cervus elaphus italicus), a unique and endangered subspecies. Time to move: an Italian red deer in the Bosco della Mesola nature reserve in northern Italy This journey, from Bosco della Mesola nature reserve in Emilia Romagna to the Parco delle Serre in Calabria is one of the key steps of Operazione Cervo Italico – Operation Italian Deer – aimed at saving the deer from extinction. The Mesola red deer is the last indigenous red deer of the Italian peninsula. It once thrived in the interconnected forests that covered the country’s north, but centuries of hunting and habitat destruction almost eradicated it. Only a handful of deer survived in Mesola Wood, which was spared from being converted to farmland, unlike much of the Po valley. By the end of the second world war there were 10, perhaps 15 individuals left. Seventy years of intensive and often complex conservation efforts by the State Forestry Corps, part of the Carabinieri police, allowed the population of Italian deer to grow to today’s number. Yet its survival is anything but guaranteed. Selecting the individuals fit to start a new community in the south is a complex business “The Italian deer could disappear overnight,” says Marco Galaverni, programme director of World Wide Fund for Nature Italy, which is helping to lead the operation. “A natural disaster, like a wildfire or a flood, like those happening increasingly often in this area, could threaten the whole population. With such low genetic variability, an epidemic also is a real – and devastating – possibility.” Operation Italian Deer in action. Under cover of night, the team capture a deer and perform all the necessary health checks It has, however, taken 10 years for Operation Italian Deer to get off the ground. “It [the deer] received much less recognition than other Italian iconic subspecies, such as the Marsican brown bear or the Apennine chamois,” says Giovanni Nobili of the Carabinieri’s biodiversity department. It’s moving day. The deer are loaded by forklift truck into the transporter, and the 620-mile journey south begins It took decades to classify the Italian deer as a separate subspecies, despite its clear differences from European mainland red deer – it has much simpler antlers, a stouter body and weighs about 40% less. This issue, and a lack of agreement between organisations, led to a delay in the creation of Operation Italian Deer. Finally, this year, it was launched under the auspices of WWF, the Carabinieri, the two nature reserves and the University of Siena. Des res: an aerial view of their new home in the Parco delle Serre, Calabria Under the plan, 60 deer are being moved to the park in Calabria, with the aim of building a new population. The area was designated by Ispra, the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, as one of the few having the right environmental conditions to host the subspecies and being far enough from European red deer to avoid interbreeding. The first 20 were moved in March, with the rest to follow over the next couple of years. “This will allow us to monitor the evolution of the operation, and to adapt to all the issues we will encounter,” says Sandro Nicoloso, head of the team from the wildlife organisation Dream Italia, which is conducting the capture, transport and release of the deer. Home sweet home: the deer are released into a new habitat that should allow them to thrive once more The fittest male and females are identified in Mesola before being shot with a tranquilliser dart gun. The deer are retrieved from the dense undergrowth and taken to stables where they are housed for a week before being driven the entire length of Italy. Vets monitor the health of the deer during all phases of the operation and the animals are fitted with satellite tracking collars. The operation doesn’t end there. Researchers will monitor the deer to make sure all is well “The real challenge begins now,” says Galaverni after the deer are successfully delivered. The deer will need to adapt to their new habitat, as will local communities. Some farmers believe they could become a nuisance, like the fast-spreading boars. “It will require a lot of talking and explaining to local communities, but the response has been very positive so far,” says Alfonso Grillo, commissioner of the Parco delle Serre. “People need to understand the incredible value of this process of renaturalisation that Italy, as well as Europe, is going through,” he adds.

Marcus McGowan, 51, was snorkelling near the Charles Hardy Islands, 40km off the Cape York coast, with his wife and friends when he was attacked on Saturday. The Gold Coast resident was taken from behind by the saltwater crocodile and initially thought it was a shark until he reached up with his hands. “I realised it was a crocodile. I was able to lever its jaws open just far enough to get my head out,” McGowan said in a statement released by the Cairns health service. “The crocodile then attempted to attack me a second time, but I managed to push it away with my right hand, which was then bitten. I was able to escape the crocodile’s grip once again and swim to the safety of the boat which was coming after they heard our screams for help.” McGowan estimated the crocodile was a 2-3 metre-long juvenile. The keen surfer and diver was taken by boat to Haggerstone Island 45 minutes away, before being flown by helicopter to Thursday Island hospital. He was later transferred to Cairns hospital for treatment of scalp lacerations and puncture wounds on his head and hand. “When you enter the marine environment, you are entering territory that belongs to potentially dangerous animals, such as sharks and crocodiles,” McGowan said. “I was simply in the wrong place, at the wrong time.” People who escape crocodile attacks usually frighten the reptiles, Billy Collett, the operations manager at Australia Reptile Park, said. “Crocodiles are the hardest-biting animal on the planet,” he said. “But when people do fight back, they seem to let go. He probably scared the croc which realised it grabbed something too big to handle.” The Queensland science department is investigating. “It is important that crocodile sightings and crocodile incidents are reported in a timely manner,” the department said in a statement. “Crocodiles in the open ocean can be difficult to locate as the animals often travel tens of kilometres per day.” The area around Haggerstone Island is known as “croc country,” the department said, while urging visitors to practice “crocwise behaviour”. It warned crocodiles could be in all waterways, even if there were no warning signs. People in smaller vessels like canoes and kayaks were at greater risk of attack, as were people standing close to the water’s edge or wading through while fishing, the department said. Saturday’s incident followed other crocodile attacks in the region this year. In April, a 65-year-old man’s foot was bitten as he slept on Newell beach. A man in his 40s sustained serious injuries to his abdomen, leg and head while fishing at Archer Point, while a 65-year-old was killed while fishing at Lakefield national park in Cape York. His remains were found in two crocodiles. In February, a crocodile over 4 metres long attacked a man and ate his dog south of Cooktown.'}, {'_id': '64940b2d51ac334d9273a9cf', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/30/cop28-president-team-accused-of-wikipedia-greenwashing-sultan-al-jaber', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Cop28 president’s team accused of Wikipedia ‘greenwashing’', 'lead': 'Exclusive: UAE using site to ‘control narrative’ amid criticism of oil boss leading climate summit, say critics', 'author': 'Ben Stockton', 'datePublished': '2023-05-30 05:00:22', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-22 10:49:49.564041', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/f1501910e16cb6ae9b95e60b6bbbfebb01ee2cba/0_193_5776_3466/500.jpg', 'body': 'The Cop28 president, Sultan Al Jaber, has been accused of attempting to “greenwash” his image after it emerged that members of his team had edited Wikipedia pages that highlighted his role as CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc). Work by Al Jaber’s team on his and the climate summit’s Wikipedia entries include adding a quote from an editorial that said Al Jaber – the United Arab Emirates minister for industry and advanced technology – was “precisely the kind of ally the climate movement needs”. They also suggested that editors remove reference to a multibillion-dollar oil pipeline deal he signed in 2019, the Centre for Climate Reporting and the Guardian can reveal. “Oil companies and their CEOs are taking greenwash to a whole new level – seizing control of global climate conferences, then getting their own employees to airbrush out criticism of their blatant hypocrisy on Wikipedia,” said Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP. The UAE government, which controls about 6% of the world’s oil reserves, has been criticised for appointing a fossil fuel boss as head of Cop28, which will be held in Dubai in November. Last week, 130 US and EU lawmakers called on Al Jaber to be removed from his post as the summit’s president. Meanwhile, Al Jaber has been working with major consultancy firms and PR agencies to promote his work as an advocate for Emirati investment in green energy. His appointment as Cop28 president was welcomed by the likes of John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, and other key figures in international climate diplomacy. Pointing to Al Jaber’s work on climate issues over the past decade, a spokesperson for Cop28 said: “We will continue to ensure that all publicly available sources of information about the presidency and its leadership remain factually accurate and up to date.” Al Jaber’s role as both CEO of Adnoc and Cop28 president is at the centre of the controversy. The company is forging a major expansion of the UAE’s fossil fuel output despite the International Energy Agency having said there must be no new oil and gas projects if the world is to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. A series of edits to Al Jaber’s Wikipedia page since March last year reveal the extent to which his team has tried to control public perception of his record in the fossil fuel industry. A Wikipedia user, whose identity is unknown but who disclosed they were being paid by Adnoc, suggested editors remove the reference to a $4bn agreement Al Jaber signed in 2019 with US investment giants BlackRock and KKR for the development of oil pipeline infrastructure. The user said there was “too much detail” and suggested the page say that Al Jaber had simply attracted “international investment” in Adnoc. The user also recommended that editors delete a quote from the Financial Times which highlighted the dissonance between Al Jaber’s role as the UAE’s climate tsar and his driving of Adnoc’s fossil fuel expansion. Instead, they suggested that the page note the company was using the revenues from this increased oil output to “invest in carbon capture and green fuel technologies”. In this case, only some of the changes they suggested were actually added to Al Jaber’s Wikipedia page. “Well sourced material that includes pertinent information (even if it’s a little more detail than ideally the company would like to see shared in an article) would always be retained,” an editor told the user. A spokesperson for Adnoc said: “We are very proud of Dr Sultan’s achievements as a global energy leader and regularly review content to ensure accuracy. Update requests were submitted to Wikipedia in the spring and summer of 2022, which were fully transparent and compliant as per Wikipedia’s guidelines.” More recently, a member of the Cop28 team has been directly editing Wikipedia articles, despite having been “strongly discouraged” from doing so. In February, a user going by the alias Junktuner made a number of edits to the climate summit’s Wikipedia page. The Cop28 team confirmed that its head of marketing, Ramzi Haddad, who uses the same handle on Twitter, owns the Junktuner account. Haddad only disclosed his ties to Al Jaber after being questioned by another user. The US senator Sheldon Whitehouse, who led last week for Al Jaber to be replaced as the summit’s president, said: “It’s not surprising that Cop28 is trying to burnish Al Jaber’s green credentials, but the fact remains that as an oil executive he is also overseeing a lot of damage to the planet.” Whitehouse called on the UN, which oversees the Cop process, to “rethink how to run these very important forums” to avoid undue influence by the fossil fuel industry. The climate summit’s Wikipedia page includes a quote from Amnesty International saying: “[Sultan Al Jaber] cannot be an honest broker for climate talks when the company he leads is planning to cause more climate damage.” Beneath it, Haddad added a quote from a Bloomberg editorial which stated that “Al Jaber is precisely the kind of ally the climate movement needs”. He has also added links to Al Jaber’s website and social media accounts. The administrator wrote to Haddad: “The nature of your edits, such as the one you made to 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, gives the impression you have an undisclosed financial stake in promoting a topic. “Paid advocates are very strongly discouraged from direct article editing.” Despite later disclosing his conflict of interest and saying he would “refrain from further edits”, Haddad has continued to make minor changes to Wikipedia pages. It has also come to light that Haddad made a series of edits anonymously – where only an IP address is visible – before he was “aware of the proper conflict of interest procedures”. Haddad revealed the information in response to more questions from the Wikipedia administrator after the Centre for Climate Reporting contacted the administrator. Haddad also promoted Al Jaber’s green credentials anonymously. He added to Al Jaber’s Wikipedia page that he was “the first CEO to ever serve as Cop president, having played a key role in shaping the country’s clean energy pathway”. A Cop28 spokesperson said: “Cop28 has and will continue to ensure online descriptions of the Cop28 presidency are accurate across all online platforms, including Wikipedia.” They added that the changes were “all evidence based”. Edits have also been made by a user being paid by Masdar, the UAE government-owned clean energy company of which Al Jaber was formerly CEO and is now chairman of the board. They worked to make Al Jaber’s role at Masdar more prominent on his page the day after the Guardian revealed his appointment as Cop28 president in January. They added that Al Jaber’s “goal is to expand Masdar’s clean energy capacity to 100GW by 2030, making it the second largest renewable investor in the world”. Masdar did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Marwa Fatafta, who leads work in the Middle East by the digital rights group Access Now, said the “alarming” revelations were part of broader attempts by the UAE to “control the narrative” and “polish up the image of Al Jaber”. “Once he was appointed, there was pushback,” she said. “And I think these criticisms will be amplified further and further as we get closer to Cop28, so I see it as a preemptive step to try and control and shape the narrative as much as they can.”'}, {'_id': '64931aaf51ac33179f2db4fb', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/climate-campaigner-sarah-finch-takes-surrey-oil-drilling-case-to-supreme-court', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Climate campaigner takes Surrey oil drilling case to supreme court ', 'lead': 'Sarah Finch’s challenge to plans to allow oil well hinges on wider environmental impact of fossil fuels', 'author': 'Damien Gayle', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 14:32:56', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-21 17:43:43.988703', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e39c627cb529d7bbcbd10b10c30681b44caca896/0_197_5896_3538/500.jpg', 'body': 'Climate campaigners have begun a supreme court challenge to plans to drill for oil in Surrey, in a case they hope could set a precedent restricting plans for future fossil fuel projects in the UK. Sarah Finch is challenging Surrey county council’s decision to extend permission for a well at Horse Hill, near Gatwick airport in the Surrey countryside, which taps a subterranean reservoir developers believe may contain millions of barrels of oil. The case turns on the interpretation of rules surrounding planners’ drafting of environmental impact assessments. The campaigners argue that the planning committee that granted permission for the drilling erred because it only accounted for emissions arising from the drilling site itself, rather than those from the oils’ end use, when it is burned and most of the emissions produced. She has already lost in the high court and the court of appeal. On Wednesday morning, five supreme court justices, Lord Kitchin, Lord Sales, Lord Leggatt, Lady Rose, and Lord Richards, began hearing the case. A victory would have serious implications for future plans for oil and gas wells and coalmines in the UK, forcing planners to take into account the total emissions from any fossil fuels extracted, rather than merely the emissions from the extraction. Ahead of the case, Finch said: “The biggest climate impact from fossil fuel projects occurs when the fuel they produce is eventually burned. “It’s unbelievable that these ‘downstream’ GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions are ignored when planning decisions are made. I hope that the supreme court will give a clear ruling and end the dangerous lack of clarity on this point.” The proposed expansion of the Horse Hill site would include five drilling cellars, four hydrocarbon production wells, four gas-to-power generators, a process, storage and tanker loading area, seven 1,300-barrel oil tanks, and a 37-metre drill rig. Altogether, they would allow for the large-scale production of up to 3.3m tonnes of crude oil, for sale and use as transport fuel for the next 20 years. “It’s difficult to overstate the importance of this case,” said Rowan Smith, a solicitor with Leigh Day, who is representing Finch. “The supreme court will rule conclusively on whether or not the climate change impact of fossil fuel development in the UK must be taken into account before planning permissions are granted. There is a huge amount at stake for the future of the planet and the UK’s ability to meet its carbon reduction targets.” Lawyers for Surrey county council dispute Finch’s claim, arguing her approach to the interpretation of environmental impact requirements was “misguided”. Mr Justice Holgate considered the case in 2020 and dismissed Finch’s claim for a judicial review of planning permission granted by Surrey county council. Lord Justice Lewison, Sir Keith Lindblom and Lord Justice Moylan dismissed Finch’s appeal in 2022. Such is the significance of the case, West Cumbria mining, the company behind plans for a controversial new coalmine in Cumbria, has submitted its own intervention. The outcome of Finch’s case could seriously affect the future of the proposed mine, which as yet does not include downstream emissions in its impact assessment. Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the Office for Environmental Protection have also intervened, on Finch’s behalf. Outside the supreme court on Wednesday, Danny Gross, a climate campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said the case was part of a long struggle to hold the fossil fuel industry to account. “It will set a crucial precedent that before any fossil fuel project goes ahead the full climate impacts need to be taken into account, because the emissions from extracting the fossil fuels are tiny in comparison to the emissions from burning them,” he said.'}, {'_id': '64931aaf51ac33179f2db50a', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/orca-rams-yacht-off-shetland-first-such-incident-northern-waters', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Orca rams into yacht off Shetland in first such incident in northern waters', 'lead': 'Cetacean exhibits same behaviour towards vessel in North Sea that has been seen in Iberian orca population', 'author': 'Philip Hoare and Jeroen Hoekendijk', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 13:27:45', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-21 17:43:43.988978', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/200f4e2bb0b1c109698da48bccd73a273410292a/275_0_4140_2484/500.jpg', 'body': 'An orca repeatedly rammed a yacht in the North Sea off Shetland on Monday, in a concerning development following previous interactions between the cetaceans and vessels in the strait of Gibraltar and Portugal. Dr Wim Rutten, a 72-year-old retired Dutch physicist and experienced yachtsperson, was sailing solo from Lerwick to Bergen in Norway. He was fishing for mackerel, with a single line off the back of the boat, when the orca suddenly appeared in the clear water, and hit the stern of the seven-ton boat. “I said: ‘Shit!’” Rutten, who said he had heard about the “Portuguese accidents”, told the Guardian. The whale hit again and again, creating “soft shocks” through the aluminium hull. “What I felt [was] most frightening was the very loud breathing of the animal,” he said. The orca stayed behind the boat “looking for the keel. Then he disappeared ... but came back at fast speed, twice or thrice ... and circled a bit. “Maybe he just wanted to play. Or look me in the eyes. Or to get rid of the fishing line.” This is the same behaviour that has been seen in the Iberian orca population, but it is the first time it has been known to happen in northern waters. Highly social cetaceans, orcas use complex vocalisations to communicate and to hunt for food, from small fish to blue whales. They learn matrilineally, and post-menopausal females assume the greatest importance in individual pods. “Grandmothers” in the Iberian population of whales have been seen observing during the interactions with yachts and other vessels. Experts believe this could be play among juvenile whales. Dr Alfredo López, of the Grupo de Trabajo Orca Atlántica in Portugal, said: “We know that many boats use fishing lines from the stern to fish and it is a motivation for orcas, they come to examine them.” But the focus on boats’ rudders may come from adult whales who have developed an aversion towards boats, perhaps because they “had a bad experience and try to stop the boat so as not to repeat it”. Most surprising is the fact that this learned behaviour should have appeared nearly 3,000 miles (4,800km) from Gibraltar. Dr Conor Ryan, a scientific adviser to the Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust, who has studied orca pods off the Scottish coast, said: “I’d be reluctant to say it cannot be learned from [the southern population]. It’s possible that this ‘fad’ is leapfrogging through the various pods/communities.” Ryan suggests there may be “highly mobile pods that could transmit this behaviour a long distance”. López thinks, however, “that human activities, even in an indirect way, are at the origin of this behaviour”. Increased marine traffic, dwindling food sources, warming seas and noise pollution could all play a part. Rutten added: “Maybe the universe knows. We do not.”'}, {'_id': '64931aaf51ac33179f2db547', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/21/how-dangerous-the-ocean-can-be-canadian-city-rallies-for-titan-rescue', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘How dangerous the ocean can be’: Canadian city rallies for Titan rescue', 'lead': 'The crew of the missing sub departed St John’s – a city that’s no stranger to ocean peril – to explore the wreck of the Titanic', 'author': "Leyland Cecco in Toronto and Spoorthy Raman in St John's, Newfoundland", 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 09:05:00', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-21 17:43:43.990127', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0b6f246760ce9c44b470d870182f0ec86207abec/0_0_3500_2100/500.jpg', 'body': 'Shortly after sunrise on Friday, a hulking icebreaker departed the protected waters of St John’s, Newfoundland, and ventured into the unpredictable vastness of the north Atlantic Ocean. Onboard the ship was an array of scientific monitoring equipment, cameras and a sleek, 22ft-long submersible named Titan. The passengers onboard the chartered Polar Prince vessel were excited at the prospect of reaching the final resting site of the RMS Titanic, even if it meant cramming themselves inside the hollow body of Titan. But the small carbon fibre craft disappeared on Sunday, nearly two hours after it dipped below the surface, en route to the remains of the sunken ocean liner. The disappearance has prompted a frantic international search, with Canada and the US marshalling all available resources in a race against time. The Titanic never reached its destination of New York City. But along the east coast of Canada, the legacy of the doomed ship still looms large more than a century after it sank. More than 120 victims of the disaster are buried in the Fairview cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia – at the time the city nearest to the sinking with rail and shipping connections. The city’s Museum of the Atlantic showcases artifacts from the ship, including a deck chair, personal effects and wreckage, as well as the white canvas mortuary bags used for the victims. St John’s, Canada’s easternmost city in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, remains the closest city to the liner’s final resting place and has become the launching site for expeditions traveling to the wreck site, nearly 400 miles (650km) away – and more than 12,000ft (3,800m) below the surface of the ocean. On Tuesday, the city, known for its brightly coloured “biscuit box” houses, was blanketed in a thick haze of fog and rain as residents made sense of the news. “To hear that there are people in distress possibly and not knowing where they are and if we’re ever going to find them … it’s heart-wrenching,” said Anne Simmons, operations manager at a local tour company. “The whole world is watching because it’s the Titanic. Everybody knows about it.” On April 1912, the Titanic received warnings of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Hours later, a remote Marconi wireless station on the south-east tip of the island received the Titanic’s first distress call. St John’s is also home to Memorial University and the world-class Marine Institute research centre, which recently announced a partnership with OceanGate, the American company behind the missing submersible. Friday’s mission was the company’s fifth Titanic expedition. Onboard were Hamish Harding, 58, a British explorer and pilot who has previously taken a suborbital spaceflight; British Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48; and Dawood’s son Suleman, 19. “Due to the worst winter in Newfoundland in 40 years, this mission is likely to be the first and only manned mission to the Titanic in 2023. A weather window has just opened up and we are going to attempt a dive tomorrow,” Harding posted on Instagram on Saturday. “We started steaming from St John’s, Newfoundland, Canada, yesterday and are planning to start dive operations around 4am tomorrow morning. Until then we have a lot of preparations and briefings to do.” Paul Henri Nargeolet, a deep diver, submersible pilot, former French navy commander and a leading authority on the Titanic wreck site, is also believed to have been onboard alongside Stockton Rush, the founder of OceanGate. On Tuesday, St John’s harbour was blanketed in a thick cover of fog. Out on the ocean, challenging conditions have hampered the search efforts. “I don’t believe anybody should just be able to build their own submarine and head off into the world without the skills or talents to do so because then you know tragedies like this do happen,” said resident Ashton Quinn. “I feel very bad for the families of the people involved.” As the search intensifies, there is collective hope the vessel can be located. The province is no stranger to disaster – it took in 38 airplanes when airspace was closed during 9/11, an act of generosity celebrated in the hit Broadway musical Come From Away – nor is it a stranger to loss.

Last month, Ecuador struck the biggest deal of its kind: refinancing $1.6bn (£1.3bn) of its commercial debt at a discount in exchange for a consistent revenue stream for conservation around the Galápagos Islands. Other nature-rich countries that are struggling to pay their debts have taken notice and deals are rumoured in Gabon and Sri Lanka. The market for debt-for-nature swaps is poised to exceed $800bn, according to Bloomberg, prompting fierce competition between banks as demand for green investments increases. Debt-for-nature swaps mean reducing a developing country’s debt burden in exchange for guaranteed finance for nature. Supporters of the concept – which has its roots in the 1980s debt crisis and an idea from the late “father of biodiversity”, Thomas Lovejoy – say it is a win-win for financiers, countries and conservationists. This week, the subject will be on the agenda at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris, spearheaded by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Barbados entered into its own $150m debt-for-nature deal in 2021. “The world is facing a biodiversity, climate and debt crisis, which is even more pronounced in the developing world,” says Slav Gatchev, managing director of sustainable debt for the Nature Conservancy (TNC), which is often involved in facilitating deals. “There is an overlap between biodiversity hotspots in the tropics and excessive levels of debt,” he says. “Typically, countries approach us because they’ve seen that these deals can be done at scale. “You can move the needle in terms of financial pinch points, resolving liquidity constraints before they become solvency problems and, because of our role as a conservation organisation, we can be an honest broker when it comes to implementing these programmes on the ground.” But detractors of the deals warn of greenwashing, and have criticised agreements in which banks often take large fees with comparatively small amounts going to conservation. In a note to investors in January, Barclays questioned the green credentials of debt-for-nature swaps – often sold as ESG (environmental, social and governance) investments – because only a small fraction of the deal size ends up with conservation. This claim is strongly disputed by the banks involved. Separately, Daniel Ortega Pacheco, a former Ecuadorian environment minister, is concerned about the potential implications of the agreements for sovereignty. Last month’s Galápagos agreement requires Ecuador to provide about $18m a year to conserve waters near the islands, mostly for a new Hermandad marine reserve that hosts whale sharks, blue whales and leatherback turtles. “When you take a closer look at nature-for-debt swaps, Moody’s actually says they count as a default. [A deal] might prejudice developing countries in the long term and there are restrictions on how the money can be spent. Even after the second world war, Germany was free to decide where to invest,” he says. The concerns are echoed by Katie Kedward, a UCL research fellow, who says the agreements do not go far enough. “The pandemic has brought debt restructuring back into the conversation. In terms of sovereign debt burdens, those constraints are preventing countries from investing in conservation and adaptation to the increased risks of climate change. “I would argue that we need to go further and look at debt forgiveness. I am hugely sceptical about how debt-for-nature swaps are being implemented in practice,” she says. Gatchev says these concerns are unfounded, pointing to case studies by TNC of deals in Belize and Barbados, which he says show that the benefit accrues to the countries. The deals are specific to the requirements of each country and try to anticipate potential problems. The Belize agreement includes natural disaster insurance, intended to avoid the scenario where the country is forced to pay for conservation instead of rebuilding after a hurricane. The reasons for entering the agreements bear striking parallels to the arguments of Lovejoy in 1984, when the idea was first developed. “As debtor nations cut back on government spending, programmes for protecting natural resources are among the first to go,” Lovejoy wrote in the New York Times at the time. “Costa Rica’s superb national park system cannot be staffed or enlarged without private donations from outside the country. “Brazil’s equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency can do little more than pay the salaries of its employees; when fires recently broke out in its national park system, there were few guards around to fight them,” he said. In Paris, Mia Mottley’s Bridgetown agenda will attempt to reform global finance for the environmental crises of the modern age. For some, the nature-for-debt swap is part of the answer.

It found people recently exposed to dirtier air before contracting the illness spent four days longer in hospital, the same impact as on those 10 years their senior. The Belgian study also showed that air pollution levels measured in patients’ blood were linked to a 36% increase in the risk of needing intensive care treatment. A separate study in Denmark showed air pollution exposure was linked to a 23% increase in the risk of death from Covid-19. In both studies, the level of air pollution was below legal EU standards. Previous research suggested that air pollution worsened Covid outcomes but, rather than assessing groups of people together, the new studies followed individual patients and therefore give much more confidence in the results. Air pollution is known to be a major risk factor in aggravating respiratory diseases. It increases inflammation in the lungs and weakens immune defences, and causes pre-existing lung problems that worsen the outcomes of new infections. The new research shows cutting air pollution is a crucial measure for reducing illness and deaths during future outbreaks of respiratory diseases, including the annual flu season. Cleaner air brought health benefits almost as great as some of the medical treatments given to the Covid-19 patients, the research showed. “Reducing air pollution, even when at relatively low levels, increases the health of the population and makes them less susceptible to future pandemics,” said Prof Tim Nawrot, at Hasselt University in Belgium. “The pandemic placed an enormous strain on doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers. Our research suggests that air pollution made that burden even greater.” Dr Zorana Jovanovic Andersen, at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and senior author of the Danish study, said: “These results show how air pollution can compromise our immune system and leave us vulnerable. Reduction of air pollution should be at the heart of preventive measures for current and future pandemics, as well as a strategy for dealing with seasonal influenza pandemics.” Many previous studies assessing the link between Covid and air pollution were what epidemiologists call “ecological studies”, which assess the relationship using averaged data for a whole population. These could be completed quickly and some factors that may influence the link could be taken into account. But hidden factors could not be ruled out and the variation of air pollution over short distances could not be accounted for. In contrast, the new studies followed the illness and air pollution exposure in individual people. The Belgian study, published in the European Respiratory Journal (ERJ), followed more than 300 patients who were hospitalised with Covid-19 between May 2020 and March 2021. Data on the levels of three pollutants – fine particles, nitrogen dioxide and soot – at the patients’ homes were gathered and the amount of soot in the patients’ blood was also measured. Other factors known to affect Covid-19 disease, such as age, sex and weight, were taken into account. The difference in air pollution used in the studies to assess the impact on Covid-19 was based on the range of pollution levels recorded. The higher level used was midway towards the top of the range – at the 75% mark – and the lower level was towards the bottom of the range – at the 25% mark. The researchers found people exposed to the higher level a week before hospital admission went on to spend about four more days in hospital. They also found the lower level of air pollution resulted in health improvements equivalent to 40-80% of the benefits of medicines used to treat Covid, such as remdesivir. The Danish study, also published in the ERJ, used Denmark’s national Covid-19 surveillance system to follow all 3.7 million people in the country aged 30 or older over the first 14 months of the pandemic. It found patients exposed to the higher level of small particle air pollution in 2019 were about 23% more likely to go on to die from Covid-19. A similar recent study in New York City found the increased risk of death was 11%. Prof Charlotte Suppli Ulrik, head of the European Respiratory Society assembly on the environment and epidemiology, said: “We are finding more and more evidence that breathing polluted air is contributing to lung diseases, including infections. Although the Covid-19 global health emergency is over, the impact of pollution on our health is continuing and we need governments to take action for the sake of our health and our health services.” Prof Jordi Sunyer and Dr Payam Dadvand, at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health and commenting on the Belgian study, said it showed that cutting air pollution would be “a very effective way to protect our population” from Covid-19 and other respiratory infections. “Despite the evidence, the air quality standards are still above harmful values and even these rather lax standards are still not met in most cities in the world, including many European cities,” they said.'}, {'_id': '64931aaf51ac33179f2db56d', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/21/country-diary-the-hay-harvest-has-begun-and-the-air-is-vanilla-sweet', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: The hay harvest has begun, and the air is vanilla-sweet | Kate Blincoe', 'lead': '<strong>Caistor St Edmund, Norfolk:</strong> We badly need rain on the farm, just not for the next five days', 'author': 'Kate Blincoe', 'datePublished': '2023-06-21 04:30:02', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-21 17:43:43.990812', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e8098e8ee7e7c58e366f73886e119f15004f6ee6/0_605_4032_2419/500.jpg', 'body': 'Like sentinels guarding a spot, three red kites slowly stir in the sky. My eyes trace downwards to a cloud of dust swirling up like a portal. A neighbouring farm has started cutting the long grass to make hay. As the habitat is razed, wildlife will be scattering – voles, mice, deer, hares. Back at High Ash farm, my brother consults the forecast. Should he too be cutting the hay? It’s a high-risk crop. Most harvests remove the produce off the land the second it is cut, safely into the barn. With hay, you leave it on the ground at the mercy of the weather, where it requires five sunny days to dry out fully. Overnight, the dismal grey cloud that has shrouded Norfolk vanishes. The decision is made to cut a few fields and the machinery roars into action. Wildlife here takes precedence. All the wildflower “pollen and nectar” mixes will be left untouched until late August. Early cutting of hay is not ideal from a wildlife perspective, but nature-friendly mowing practices help reduce the impact. This includes cutting the field from the centre outwards, and having other uncut fields where animals can flee to. By contrast, in my dad’s boyhood, terriers and lurchers would have been on hand to catch escaping creatures. Later, as I stroll across the freshly mown field, just a solitary red kite overhead, I inhale that distinctive sweet, almost vanilla hay aroma that epitomises summer. The scent is known as “coumarin” and is found in sweet vernal grass. It becomes more aromatic as it dries. Coumarin has even been synthesised for use in best-selling designer fragrances. Going back a century or so, half this farm was hay crop, grown to fuel the working horses that laboured on the land. Today, it is needed for leisure horses. The irony is that many owners will need to soak the nutritious, energy-rich hay to remove sugars and avoid overweight horses. This summer, we’re heading into drought conditions, with young trees already dead or showing signs of stress. But just for a few days we stop hoping for rain. This year’s harvest is under way and there’s no turning back. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64931aaf51ac33179f2db582', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/gas-stoves-benzene-levels-study', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Gas stoves emit benzene levels above secondhand smoke, US study finds', 'lead': 'Even low doses of airborne benzene raise the risk of a variety of cancers, including lymphomas and leukemia', 'author': 'Oliver Milman', 'datePublished': '2023-06-20 21:39:06', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-21 17:43:43.991215', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/2567d9db1b6be2fb0dfff9f895bf58ccbce30936/0_309_2972_1784/500.jpg', 'body': 'Using a gas stove can raise indoor concentrations of benzene, a cancer-linked chemical, to above what is found in secondhand smoking or even beyond levels found next to oil and gas facilities, a new study has found. The research, which measured benzene levels in 87 homes in California and Colorado, found that gas and propane stoves frequently emitted benzene at rates well above healthy benchmarks set by the World Health Organization and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Leaving a single gas hob on for 45 minutes raised benzene levels to above that found in secondhand tobacco smoking, or at the boundary of oil and gas plants, with emissions 10 to 25 times higher than that from electric coil stoves. Even low-burning hobs, or gas oven use, emit significant levels of benzene. Induction stoves emit no benzene at all, the researchers found. The peer-reviewed study, led by scientists at Stanford University, is the first to use new monitors to effectively measure benzene indoors. Even low doses of airborne benzene raise the risk of a variety of cancers, including lymphomas and leukemia, by damaging people’s bone marrow. Elevated levels of benzene can linger for six hours throughout a house or apartment after a gas stove is turned off. “I’m hard-pressed to think of a more powerful chemical cause of leukemia than benzene,” said Jan Kirsch, a California-based oncologist who said that people had in their homes a “very potent” cause of blood cell cancers. “People have died, undoubtably, from exposure to benzene in their homes and unless this problem is ameliorated people will continue to do so,” Kirsch said. “The idea is not to cause panic, but there are risks and we want to reduce them. It’s important this message is carried to the public, so we can understand and act on it.” More than a third of households in the US use gas stoves, although many lack adequate ventilation to help reduce dangerous levels of benzene, the researchers said. Range hoods, even when they are used, often just circulate air around a dwelling rather than expel the harmful chemicals. The result is indoor air hazards that often rival, or even exceed, the sort of outdoor air pollution that has been reduced through clean air regulations over the past 50 years. Gas stoves “are the only common fossil fuel appliance to vent pollution indoors”, said Rob Jackson, a scientist at Stanford who helped lead the new research. “We would never willingly stand over the tailpipe of a car, breathing in its pollution, but we do willingly stand over our stoves, breathing in the pollution they emit,” he added. Decades of previous research has highlighted the dangers posed by a stew of different emissions, including carbon monoxide and formaldehyde, that come from the burning of gas indoors. A study from earlier this year found that gas stoves are responsible for more than 12% of all childhood asthma cases in the US, with separate research discovering that a series of different pollutants are expelled from gas stoves, even after they are turned off. Joe Biden’s administration has attempted to formulate efficiency standards for new stoves to lower such pollution, with around half of all stoves currently sold likely to fail the proposed safeguards. Several states, such as New York, have moved to phase out gas appliances in new buildings, too. This has provoked a furious political backlash, however, with Ron DeSantis, the Republican presidential hopeful, seeking to prevent any sort of gas stove ban in Florida, the state in which he is governor. Republicans in both the US House of Representatives and the Senate, meanwhile, have pushed forward legislation that would prohibit the banning of gas stoves. “Nothing is off limits to the radical left’s Green New Deal agenda,” said Markwayne Mullin, a Republican senator who signed onto the bill last week to “get Washington out of our kitchens and our pocketbooks”. Joe Manchin, the centrist Democrat from West Virginia, has joined with the Republicans, complaining last week that the “federal government has no business telling Americans how to cook their dinner”. Stanford’s Jackson pointed out that there is no proposal to remove people’s existing gas stoves but that it made sense to encourage the adoption of cleaner-burning appliances when stove purchases are made in order to protect public health. “We should incentivize the use of induction stoves, particularly in lower-income communities,” he said. “We stopped cooking over coal a century ago in the US because gas is cleaner and today I believe we should eventually stop cooking over gas because electricity is cleaner. We have a cleaner technology available today.”'}, {'_id': '64917c9251ac331c00331980', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/20/nature-at-risk-of-breakdown-if-cop15-pledges-not-met-world-leaders-warned', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Nature at risk of breakdown if Cop15 pledges not met, world leaders warned', 'lead': 'Author of landmark UK review into the economic value of nature joins UN environment chief in calls for ‘action, not just words’ on biodiversity goals', 'author': 'Patrick Greenfield', 'datePublished': '2023-06-20 05:00:33', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-20 12:16:50.173663', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/045c97fc9b16b3dac742bf38b34270e0e7edc502/0_67_3460_2076/500.jpg', 'body': 'Humans are exploiting nature beyond its limits, the University of Cambridge economist Prof Sir Partha Dasgupta has warned, as the UN’s environment chief calls on governments to make good on a global deal for biodiversity, six months after it was agreed. Dasgupta, the author of a landmark review into the economic importance of nature commissioned by the UK Treasury in 2021, said it was a mistake to continue basing economic policies on the postwar boom that did not account for damage to the planet. Speaking to the Guardian six months after Cop15, where countries agreed this decade’s targets to protect nature, Dasgupta cautioned that a headline goal to protect 30% of land and sea should not lead to the destruction of the remaining 70%. He reiterated a recommendation from his 2021 report that companies must disclose the parts of their supply chain that rely on nature, so governments can take action on halting biodiversity loss. Since the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework was agreed in December 2022, there has been a deal to protect the high seas and first steps towards a legally binding UN treaty to regulate plastic waste. The first few months of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s presidency in Brazil has seen reductions in deforestation in the Amazon, although nature has become a culture wars issue in the EU, with proposals on restoration and pesticide reduction facing fierce opposition. An informal update on progress towards reaching the 23 targets and four goals included in the Montreal agreement is expected to be made at Cop28 in Dubai amid continuing scientific warnings about the health of the planet. “It is a truism: if the demand for nature’s products and services continues to exceed its ability to supply, then there is going to be a breakdown,” said Dasgupta. “It is a finite resource. We know when fisheries are depleted by continuous overfishing, it leads to the destruction of a fishery. Now try to imagine that at the scale of the biosphere. “This excess demand [for nature] is only about 50 years old. There’s been a great acceleration in that demand since the second world war. This experience is guiding policy and it’s a real mistake because it has come at a big expense to natural capital. The decline has not been recorded in statistics. It doesn’t show up in national accounts,” he added. “As an economist, I like to look at small societies as a prototype of the world economy. Studying poorer village economies tells you a lot: they are deeply dependent on natural capital. Many such societies have fallen under. We’ve seen this in Sudan with rainless areas, skinny cattle and people migrating miles and miles. It is not as if we don’t know what happens when nature breaks down.” Among the targets and goals agreed in Montreal by all governments, except the Vatican and the US, were aims to protect 30% of the planet for nature by the end of the decade, reform $500bn (£410bn) of environmentally damaging subsidies and restore 30% of the planet’s degraded terrestrial, inland water, coastal and marine ecosystems. Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN environment programme, said now was the time for action from governments and businesses to make the agreement reality. “We should be very proud of what was achieved. It is words on a piece of paper. We need to make them real. Everyone needs to adjust their targets and move this beyond the environment ministry to all sectors. It needs the whole of society. Action now has to be seen, not just in words,” she said. Dasgupta’s 2021 report, inspired by the 2006 Nicholas Stern review that transformed economic understanding of climate breakdown, found the world’s economies are being put at “extreme risk” by the failure to account for the state of the natural world, and called for radical reform. “I know there is a target to protect 30% of the planet in the [Cop15] deal. But the trouble with that is what happens to the other 70%. If you don’t have a policy for protecting the other 70%, you’re going to have huge pressure on it. It’s an interrelated biosphere. The 30% and the 70% are not disconnected. There are no big barriers – there’s not a Donald Trump wall between them,” he said. As part of the Cop15 agreement, large companies around the world are required to disclose the parts of their supply chains that rely on nature and take actions to mitigate any destruction, echoing a key recommendation of the Dasgupta report. “As citizens, we all want actions: what should the government do? What should the citizen do? What should the company do? What laws should be passed? We should insist on company disclosure of what’s happening in their supply chain. By doing so, you are sending a signal to your investors. And if they care about the fact that you’re trashing the rainforest in Brazil, they’ll punish you for it. But if they never know that you’re doing it, they won’t,” he said.

Normally a bioblitz involves identifying as many life forms as possible in one place over one day. Since the owners of this 30-acre former farm have an inventory of 1,100 fellow residents already, our goal was more modest: 10 new species for their list. Some additions were admittedly less than exciting. Traps set the night before yielded several of a moth family called “the pugs”: 50 tiny elongated flakes of greyness with lines of minute dark-grey dots. They have names like grey pug, plain pug, shaded and mottled pug, but ours was perhaps the masterpiece in anonymity – common pug. Yet it was new and thus equal in bioblitz status to more noteworthy finds, including a speckled bush cricket. This extraterrestrial beast possesses an inner-body glow of fluorescent lime and manoeuvres on six stilt-like legs twice the length of the ink-freckled abdomen. Equally, an arachnid named the “cucumber spider” needs little further gloss to convey its own thrilling colours. As in all natural history work, it wasn’t what we set out to achieve that moved me most, but a realisation that crept up sideways as we went about the task. Cosford has been in a countryside stewardship scheme for three decades, and it’s astonishing how far it has journeyed towards its present wild conditions. Where once were arable crops propped up with fertilisers and pesticides are now 10,000 globes of golden yellow spread over the rolling terrain by a flower called creeping cinquefoil. Among this was a busy weave of five bumblebee species. In one 5 metre by 5 metre plot, we counted 112 bee orchids and as many pyramidal orchids. All this is in a habitat that attracts the least subsidy support, yet yields to this country possibly more biodiversity than any other – scrub. That indefinable mix of young tree and thorn bush within a scrappy mosaic of flower-rich turf. Scrub needs a rebrand more urgently than the bioblitz, but bring the two together and you have something like an English version of wildlife heaven. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '64917c9251ac331c003319b3', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/mysterious-pile-of-dumped-ppe-angers-people-in-calmore-new-forest-hampshire', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Mysterious pile of ‘dumped’ PPE angers people in New Forest', 'lead': 'Inquiry launched by Environment Agency into huge pile of medical aprons found in Calmore, Hampshire', 'author': 'Emine Sinmaz', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 19:00:37', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-20 12:16:50.174893', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/15539605c634edd5b26265c9a176714b3f2e5f30/0_174_5264_3158/500.jpg', 'body': 'The “dumping” of hundreds of thousands of pieces of unused personal protective equipment near a nature reserve on the edge of the New Forest has mystified and angered local people. But the council has revealed the giant pile of boxes containing medical aprons in Calmore, Hampshire, will be recycled into plastic bags. Councillors said they reacted with horror after the discovery was made public at a Hampshire county council (HCC) meeting last week. It is not yet known if the items are linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, but the council has asked the Environment Agency to investigate. The large-scale discovery in Calmore, near Testwood Lakes Nature Reserve, came after an investigation by New Forest District Council (NFDC) into use of land at Little Testwood Farm Caravan Park. A report from HCC’s regulatory committee said: “It became apparent that thousands of packs of medical aprons had been dumped on the land with no obvious signs that they were being protected or stored for some future use. The concern is that they have been dumped with no intention of removal to a proper facility. “The Environment Agency have been contacted to see if they can determine where the PPE originated and whether it was discarded by a health trust as substandard during the Covid procurement.” Councillor Peter Latham, the committee chair, said: “It was a surprise, to put it mildly – a reaction of horror – that something like that could have happened in Hampshire and nobody knew about it.” Councillor Neville Penman said: “I’m totally amazed at how much has been dumped. I just can’t believe it because somebody must have seen it being put there, but I’ve never seen so much waste in all my life … To be honest with you, I’m distraught over it.” A report last year revealed that protective clothing worth £4bn bought early in the pandemic was set to be burned because it was substandard. The Commons public accounts committee’s report said the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) had so much unneeded PPE that it had appointed two commercial waste firms to help it dispose of 15,000 pallets a month “via a combination of recycling and burning to generate power”. On Monday, thousands of boxes – some labelled “apron” and “made in China” – containing more than 100 units apiece remained piled on pallets near the caravan park. People living near the site said they did not see the pallets being unloaded and did not know how long they had been there for. But one man who lives in the caravan park said he was shocked by the amount of waste. The man, who did not want to be named, said: “It’s just a load of crap dumped there.

It’s shocking to find out some has been dumped here.” A NFDC spokesperson said the discovery was made after an inspection at the caravan park on 4 April. “This inspection revealed that a large quantity of PPE was being stored on the land in contravention of the caravan site licence conditions. The council, in its licensing capacity, has requested that the stored items be removed from the land,” they added. “Subsequent inspections have been carried out by Hampshire county council and The Environment Agency. All the material is packaged and palletized and is due to be removed from the site for processing and recycling into plastic bags over the coming weeks. The Environment Agency will continue to carry out further enquires as to source of the material and how it came to be present on the land.” An inspector from The Environment Agency was seen taking samples of the equipment on Monday.

Graeme Samuel, the former competition watchdog head who chaired a 2020 review of Australia’s environmental laws, says a campaign is needed to bring public awareness of biodiversity decline in line with the understanding of the climate crisis. The Biodiversity Council, which is a partnership between 11 Australian universities, surveyed people about their attitudes to nature. The online poll of about 4,050 people found although most (63%) understood how unique Australia’s wildlife was and 83% rated looking after nature as important to them, many were not aware of the extent of biodiversity loss in Australia. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The research found that fewer than half (43%) were aware Australia had one of the highest rates of mammal extinction in the world and just more than half (54%) knew most of Australia’s forests had been lost since colonisation. Awareness of climate change and how it affected nature was much higher, with 74% indicating they understood global heating was having a direct impact on wildlife and ecosystems. Winnifred Louis, professor of psychology at the University of Queensland and one of the report’s authors, said there were many psychological biases that could lead to a gulf between the state of the environment and how people perceived it. Louis said when changes in the environment were gradual it could be difficult for people to notice. “People’s opinions can be influenced by a few key species, so if they see whales they feel the oceans must be doing OK, even if many other species are missing and if whales are in much smaller numbers than in past decades,” she said. “Without specialist training, people may not recognise the difference between environments that are green and full of diverse native plants, and environments that are green and full of weed species.” Louis said much reporting and discussion on the state of nature was focused on “big ticket” species, such as bilbies or koalas, rather than things people could relate to in their local area. Samuel’s 2020 review of national laws found Australia’s environment was in unsustainable decline and successive Australian governments had failed to protect the country’s unique species and habitats. He said the public’s understanding of the nature crisis was years behind the level of awareness of the climate crisis. He called for a shift in focus from individual charismatic species – such as the koala – to flora and fauna generally and what they mean for people. “I think we need a major awareness campaign to bring people up to the same level of awareness and sensitivity to biodiversity as they have for climate change,” he said. “We’ve got a lot to do to raise awareness. It is so important.” The Biodiversity Council’s survey found the majority of respondents were concerned for Australia’s biodiversity, with at least two-thirds very or extremely concerned about waste and pollution, land-clearing, extinction of species and the loss of pollinator species and natural places. About three-quarters (72%) said more money should be spent on the environment. Scientists have estimated about $2bn is needed annually to recover Australia’s full list of almost 2,000 threatened plants, animals and ecological communities. Brendan Wintle, a professor of conservation ecology at the University of Melbourne and lead councillor at the Biodiversity Council, said about half of Australia’s economy relied on natural systems. He said the loss of biodiversity would have serious consequences for clean air, food and water, human health, Indigenous culture and national identity. “Many people would be shocked if they realised the actual state of Australia’s biodiversity,” Wintle said.'}, {'_id': '64917c9251ac331c00331a11', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/wealth-tax-help-poorer-countries-tackle-climate-crisis-economists', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'A wealth tax could help poorer countries tackle climate crisis, economists say', 'lead': 'Taxing world’s wealthiest people could help poorer countries shift economies to low-carbon and recover from climate damage', 'author': 'Fiona Harvey in Edinburgh', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 10:40:45', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-20 12:16:50.176636', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/0d3cbddc74942aed16f5a5d2c657172a34fa1dd0/0_267_4003_2402/500.jpg', 'body': 'Tax extreme wealth to pay for the climate-related damage to the poorest, a group of more than 100 leading economists have urged. A wealth tax on the fortunes of the world’s richest people would raise trillions of dollars that could be spent on helping poorer countries shift their economies to a low-carbon footing, and on “loss and damage”, the rescue and rehabilitation of countries stricken by climate disaster. A 2% tax on extreme wealth would yield about $2.5tn a year, by recent estimates. The economists, including the prominent degrowth advocate Jason Hickel, have written a letter to world leaders before a global summit on finance this week. They are calling for a tax of 1.5% for 1.5C to help ensure the world limits global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The world’s wealthiest people are responsible for an outsize proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, with the richest 1% responsible for double the carbon emissions of the world’s poorest half, according to Oxfam, but there are few constraints on them. Recent research suggests if the combined emissions of wealthy countries was counted against the destruction that the climate crisis is wreaking in poorer countries, the rich would owe the poor $6tn a year in “reparations” for the damage caused. Mark Paul, of Rutgers University, and a signatory of the letter, which was spearheaded by the campaigning group Oil Change International, said rich countries were not facing up to their responsibilities. “Global north leaders saying they can’t afford to address global crises is the oldest excuse in the book, and simply put, a lie. What’s truly unaffordable is the status quo. The truth is there is no shortage of public money that can be dedicated to the cause, only a lack of political will – but that must change.” In the letter, the economists also call for an end to harmful subsidies of fossil fuels, and the forgiveness of debts for some of the poorest countries. Alex Lenferna, of Nelson Mandela University and the Climate Justice Coalition, one of the signatories of the letter, said: “Countries in the global south are drowning in debt, which is driving austerity and undermining our ability to respond to the climate crisis. “We need much more public money to drive a truly just transition. The global north must pay their climate debt, and not use climate finance as a wolf in sheep’s clothing that advances their interests.” Richard Heede, of the Climate Accountability Institute, said fossil fuel companies must pay for the damage they have caused. “The wealthy fossil fuel companies that have acted in concert to delay action and perpetuate the carbon economy should also contribute substantially to an atmospheric trust to aid the nations and peoples who have contributed little to the climate emergency.” About 50 heads of state and government are expected to attend the summit for a new global financing pact, which will be held in Paris on Thursday and Friday, hosted by the French president Emmanuel Macron, with Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados. It is intended to address the deep concerns that developing countries have over the continuing lack of the financial assistance that has long been promised to them by richer countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. Leaders including Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, and the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, are expected to attend. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, is unlikely to attend the meeting, however. Climate finance is an increasingly contentious issue for poorer countries, which are aggrieved that the richer countries are helping Ukraine, and found trillions to cope with Covid, but are unwilling to help them with the impacts of the climate crisis. In November governments agreed to set up a fund for “loss and damage”, to help reconstruct communities afflicted by climate disaster. But there is no agreement yet on how to raise the money needed to fill it. Poorer countries also find it hard to access money for green development of their economies, despite being urged by richer countries to cut their emissions. Mottley has set out her proposals for reform of the World Bank and its fellow international institutions to triple the money they can make available to developing countries. The conference will also discuss potential new sources of revenue such as taxes on high-carbon activities, including global shipping. Avinash Persaud, an economic adviser to Mottley, told the Guardian: “We need a complete rethink of the whole nexus of climate, debt and development. What we are seeing today is new – countries affected by climate disaster, this is happening now. Countries are drowning.”'}, {'_id': '649099f751ac331455c946c6', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/quite-weird-sea-temperature-rise-in-north-east-of-england-worrying-for-residents', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Quite weird’: sea temperature rise in north-east of England worries residents ', 'lead': 'Mixed reactions greet dramatic fluctuation in sea temperatures in Tynemouth', 'author': 'Mark Brown North of England correspondent', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 17:15:23', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-19 20:09:59.545678', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/851f0c38ebf4690e4fef4424ca30ad3903024a01/0_153_4582_2750/500.jpg', 'body': '“I’ve never felt the sea this warm in June, it is quite weird,” said retired nurse Val Hedley as she finished her regular paddle along the picture-postcard golden sands of Longsands beach in Tynemouth. “Often here you will get a cold bit of the sea, then it gets warmer and then it gets cooler again.

The economists, including the prominent degrowth advocate Jason Hickel, have written a letter to world leaders before a global summit on finance this week. They are calling for a tax of 1.5% for 1.5C to help ensure the world limits global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The world’s wealthiest people are responsible for an outsize proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, with the richest 1% responsible for double the carbon emissions of the world’s poorest half, according to Oxfam, but there are few constraints on them. Recent research suggests if the combined emissions of wealthy countries was counted against the destruction that the climate crisis is wreaking in poorer countries, the rich would owe the poor $6tn a year in “reparations” for the damage caused. Mark Paul, of Rutgers University, and a signatory of the letter, which was spearheaded by the campaigning group Oil Change International, said rich countries were not facing up to their responsibilities. “Global north leaders saying they can’t afford to address global crises is the oldest excuse in the book, and simply put, a lie. What’s truly unaffordable is the status quo. The truth is there is no shortage of public money that can be dedicated to the cause, only a lack of political will – but that must change.” In the letter, the economists also call for an end to harmful subsidies of fossil fuels, and the forgiveness of debts for some of the poorest countries. Alex Lenferna, of Nelson Mandela University and the Climate Justice Coalition, one of the signatories of the letter, said: “Countries in the global south are drowning in debt, which is driving austerity and undermining our ability to respond to the climate crisis. “We need much more public money to drive a truly just transition. The global north must pay their climate debt, and not use climate finance as a wolf in sheep’s clothing that advances their interests.” Richard Heede, of the Climate Accountability Institute, said fossil fuel companies must pay for the damage they have caused. “The wealthy fossil fuel companies that have acted in concert to delay action and perpetuate the carbon economy should also contribute substantially to an atmospheric trust to aid the nations and peoples who have contributed little to the climate emergency.” About 50 heads of state and government are expected to attend the summit for a new global financing pact, which will be held in Paris on Thursday and Friday, hosted by the French president Emmanuel Macron, with Mia Mottley, the prime minister of Barbados. It is intended to address the deep concerns that developing countries have over the continuing lack of the financial assistance that has long been promised to them by richer countries, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. Leaders including Olaf Scholz, the chancellor of Germany, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry, and the Chinese premier, Li Qiang, are expected to attend. Rishi Sunak, the UK prime minister, is unlikely to attend the meeting, however. Climate finance is an increasingly contentious issue for poorer countries, which are aggrieved that the richer countries are helping Ukraine, and found trillions to cope with Covid, but are unwilling to help them with the impacts of the climate crisis. In November governments agreed to set up a fund for “loss and damage”, to help reconstruct communities afflicted by climate disaster. But there is no agreement yet on how to raise the money needed to fill it. Poorer countries also find it hard to access money for green development of their economies, despite being urged by richer countries to cut their emissions. Mottley has set out her proposals for reform of the World Bank and its fellow international institutions to triple the money they can make available to developing countries. The conference will also discuss potential new sources of revenue such as taxes on high-carbon activities, including global shipping. Avinash Persaud, an economic adviser to Mottley, told the Guardian: “We need a complete rethink of the whole nexus of climate, debt and development. What we are seeing today is new – countries affected by climate disaster, this is happening now. Countries are drowning.”'}, {'_id': '649099f751ac331455c94714', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/marine-heatwave-uk-irish-coasts-threat-oysters-fish-high-temperatures', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘Unheard of’ marine heatwave off UK and Irish coasts poses serious threat', 'lead': 'Sustained high temperatures over summer could trigger mass mortality of fish and oysters, say scientists', 'author': 'Helena Horton Environment reporter', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 10:21:19', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-19 20:09:59.547183', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/028c85b76a8fe4038312543e706cf386e9633092/0_0_6154_3691/500.jpg', 'body': 'An “unheard of” marine heatwave off the coasts of the UK and Ireland poses a serious threat to species, scientists have warned. Sea temperatures, particularly off the north-east coast of England and the west of Ireland, are several degrees above normal, smashing records for late spring and early summer. The North Sea and north Atlantic are experiencing higher temperatures, data shows. The Met Office said global sea surface temperatures in April and May reached an all-time high for those months, according to records dating to 1850, with June also on course to hit record heat levels. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has categorised parts of the North Sea as being in a category four marine heatwave, which is considered “extreme”, with areas off the coast of England up to 5C above what is usual. The Met Office says temperatures are likely to remain high because of the emerging El Niño weather phenomenon. Daniela Schmidt, a professor of earth sciences at the University of Bristol, said: “The extreme and unprecedented temperatures show the power of the combination of human-induced warming and natural climate variability like El Niño. “While marine heatwaves are found in warmer seas like the Mediterranean, such anomalous temperatures in this part of the north Atlantic are unheard of. They have been linked to less dust from the Sahara but also the North Atlantic climate variability, which will need further understanding to unravel. “Heat, like on land, stresses marine organisms. In other parts of the world, we have seen several mass mortalities of marine plants and animals caused by ocean heatwave which have caused hundreds of millions of pounds of losses, in fisheries income, carbon storage, cultural values and habitat loss. As long as we are not dramatically cutting emissions, these heatwaves will continue to destroy our ecosystems. But as this is happening below the surface of the ocean, it will go unnoticed.” Dr Dan Smale from the Marine Biological Association has been working on marine heatwaves for more than a decade and was surprised by the temperatures. He said: “I always thought they would never be ecologically impactful in the cool waters around UK and Ireland but this is unprecedented and possibly devastating. Current temperatures are way too high but not yet lethal for majority of species, although stressful for many … If it carries on through summer we could see mass mortality of kelp, seagrass, fish and oysters.” Piers Forster, a professor of climate physics at the University of Leeds, said: “Both Met Office and NOAA analyses of sea-surface temperature show temperatures are at their highest ever level – and the average sea-surface temperature breached 21C for the first time in April. These high temperatures are mainly driven by unprecedented high rates of human-induced warming. “Cleaning up sulphur from marine shipping fuels is probably adding to the greenhouse gas driven warming. The shift towards El Niño conditions is also adding to the heat. There is also evidence that there is less Saharan dust over the ocean this year. This normally reflects heat away from the ocean. So in all, oceans are being hit by a quadruple whammy – it’s a sign of things to come.” Marine heatwaves are becoming more numerous, a 2019 study found, with the number of heatwave days having tripled in the past couple of years studied. The number of heatwave days rose by more than 50% in the 30 years to 2016, compared with 1925-54. Scientists said at the time the heat destroyed swathes of sealife “like wildfires take out huge areas of forest”. The damage caused in these hotspots is also harmful to humanity, which relies on the oceans for oxygen, food, storm protection and the removal of climate-heating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. A report by the Met Office says warmer than usual marine temperatures are contributing to a reduction in sea ice. It found the amount of Arctic ice was well below average for the time of year but still above record low levels after near-average ice loss during May. However, Antarctic sea ice extent is exceptionally low, the lowest on record for this date by a wide margin. Dr Ed Blockley, the lead of the polar climate group at the Met Office, said: “Over recent decades we have seen a sustained loss in Arctic sea ice extent in every month of the year – especially in late summer to early autumn. Although the current Arctic sea ice extent is considerably higher than the record low for the time of year, it is still well below the long-term average. “Antarctic sea ice has been at very low levels since November 2016. This year we have seen Antarctic sea ice shrink to a record low point for the time of year, following a second successive annual record minimum sea ice extent in February.”'}, {'_id': '649099f751ac331455c9471b', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/christian-cooper-central-park-birdwatcher-racism', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘She doesn’t have the power’: Central Park birdwatcher Christian Cooper on why racist ‘incident’ won’t define him', 'lead': 'A white woman made a threat against Cooper in 2020, and the world took notice.

I see Christian Cooper sitting with perfect posture on a bench right at the entrance of Central Park at West 103rd street. His first question for me is: have I brought any binoculars? I don’t own a pair, I admit. No worries, he says. If we spot anything, he’ll lend me his. That’s the most important birding tip I learned from his new book: you spot movement in the sky, with your naked eye first, then you raise your binoculars, not the other way around. Cooper is joyous when he tells me this. “If the book does nothing else but teach people how to use binoculars so they can actually see the birds, mission accomplished,” he says. The book, Better Living Through Birding, is Cooper’s first memoir. It traces his journey from his childhood as a nerdy kid from Long Island, to his time as a comic book editor, to his birding days in Central Park. While doing so it weaves the history of Black people in America – from slavery and lynchings to segregation and economic disparity – into the unfolding of his life. It also covers the moment, three years ago, when Cooper received international attention when, while birdwatching in Central Park, he asked a woman to leash her dog, in compliance with park rules, because he didn’t want it to disturb or maim any nearby birds. The woman, Amy Cooper (a stranger to Christian, their shared surname a coincidence), who is white, became irate and said that she would call the cops and tell them that an African American man was threatening her life. Christian Cooper was doing no such thing, but he did film the entire exchange. He posted the video to his Facebook friends with the context of what happened. His sister Melody asked if she could share it on Twitter. Cooper hesitated but ultimately obliged. Kathy Griffin retweeted him and the rest, as they say, is history. The 69-second video got more than 45m views. Cooper now references this whole ordeal as “the incident”. In that instant, a white woman made a false accusation that could have led to his death. She knew the stakes, which is why she feigned hysteria on the phone with the cops. Christian Cooper knew the stakes, too. But though Amy Cooper swiftly lost her job after the video went viral, Christian Cooper did not want any part of the prosecutorial process, a decision that put him at odds with some Black people, including his relatives. He tells me: “There were a lot of factors involved. It was potentially very important to set a precedent where someone was held accountable, legally, for making a false accusation against a Black person.” He stresses that it was a tough call not to get involved, but unless the district attorney were to subpoena him, he was going to choose mercy. Not everyone was a fan of his choice. One of his relatives revealed the reason for their ire: “They had a brother who was in an affair with a white woman and when she got found out, she said it was rape. That person spent years in a jail in the south for that reason. So false accusations have haunted us for a long time,” Cooper says. I admit to him that, at the time, I was one of those people who was shocked that he didn’t want to be contribute more to her downfall. Punishment along with further punishment is part of what structures – and upholds – our society; we live in a punitive culture and the US has the highest incarceration rate in the world. It would be normal for Cooper to want retribution, but he doesn’t see it that way. “We [African-Americans] are fighting to have some sense of proportionality in how we are treated in the criminal justice system. So how can I turn that around and not consider the same thing?” he says. Cooper thought that the woman had already received enough punishment without further piling on necessary. “Her life had imploded. It’s not like I had been handcuffed or thrown to the ground or God forbid anything more deadly or serious,” he says. “If you could look at what happened to her and not conclude that you shouldn’t make false accusations, then how is any legal proceeding going to change your mind?” Furthermore, he says, he is not traumatized. People will approach him and say how sorry they are about his trauma. “What trauma?” Cooper says. “She just does not have that much power. Maybe it’s a consequence of being Black our whole lives.” In this country, Blackness is inextricably linked to suffering. A racist incident can often be the summary, rather than a chapter, of how our entire lives are esteemed, and this is what Cooper resists. We approach a spot where, about five or six years ago, Cooper spotted a Lincoln’s sparrow; he calls these “the fine wines of birding” because they are so hard to find. “It’s like someone took pen and watercolor and drew a sparrow because it’s so finely marked,” he says. This is what Cooper thinks about when he enters the park. He was neither traumatized nor shellshocked after “the incident”. He tells me: “When I go back to the park and I am at that spot where that mess happened, I’m not thinking about that. I’m remembering that time when there was a mourning warbler on that chip path 15 years ago and I remember the scarlet tanagers last week. That’s what I think about when I’m in the park.” Today, for example, he’s more excited about whether or not we’ll get to see an Acadian or great crested flycatcher. He’s concerned we might not get lucky because spring migration has already passed and fall migration is still months away. This is a man who routinely wakes up at 4am and ventures into Central Park at 5.30. He lets me know early on that his life and passions are more than “the incident”. As we start walking we spot a red-winged blackbird. It’s a very significant bird in Cooper’s life, he calls it his “spark bird”, a term used to describe the type of bird that first converts a person to birdwatching. Cooper references the bird at the beginning of the book and it sets the tone for a multilayered and intricate exploration of his own identity. In his book, Cooper describes the red-winged blackbird as a trickster of sorts. In the Americas, it’s part of a family of birds called icterids. When English settlers came to the western hemisphere, they thought it to be the same as the birds they saw in the UK, thus giving it the same name. But the joke was on them because the Eurasian blackbird is not an icterid, it’s part of the genus thrush. To add even more complexity, the UK already has a bird called the redwing, which belongs to the thrush family as well. Are you confused yet? Cooper writes in his book that these complicated taxonomies, through which humans label birds, first resonated with him when he was young, as a Black, queer, closeted kid growing up in a conservative Long Island community in the 60s and 70s. Though Cooper knew he was queer from the moment that his five-year-old self saw a male superhero in a comic book, he wasn’t open about his sexuality until he began studying at Harvard, where he took part in the ornithological club and the gay students association. His love of comics landed him a job as an assistant editor at Marvel in the early 90s. When he talks about this period of his life, I’m astonished by how certain he was in his identity at that time. He tells me that one day Paul Becton, a Black colorist for Marvel, walked into his office and saw a picture of the former Yankees player Steve Sax on the wall. “He was like, ‘Yes! Are you a Yankees fan?’ I’m like, ‘No.’ He’s like, ‘Are you just some homosexual with a thing for Steve Sax?’ ‘Yes,’” Cooper says. Cooper was only in his late 20s then, at a time when the world of comic book publishing was even more blindingly white than it is today. But he never tried to hide who he was: “I didn’t give them a choice. I’m queer. I’m OK with it. You can either be OK with it or not. That’s on you.” Cooper’s love of nature initially came from his father, Francis, a Korean war veteran, science teacher and civil rights activist. Francis took Cooper on trips to Yellowstone, Maine, the prairie provinces of Canada and the Olympic peninsula, trips that Cooper found it hard to return to in his writing. “At one point, my editors had to wait a whole month before they got any more pages out of me because I came to the part in telling the story of my family where everybody starts to die. I was like, ‘I cannot write this.’ I didn’t know how to deal with this. I’m not a very confessional person. And I’m not a very emotional person.” In his memoir, he writes that his father was a man who often projected his anger and frustrations on to his family, which made Cooper, his mother and his sister feel as though they were walking on eggshells around him for many years. The binoculars that hang around Cooper’s neck are the pair his father gifted to him on his 50th birthday. Even if it might have been hard for Cooper to write about and memorialize his father, his father was with us on our walk. Activism is also in Cooper’s blood. There is a photo of him as an infant in a stroller during a protest. Whether it was fighting school segregation or spearheading a Long Island chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, Cooper’s parents phoned, marched, organized and did whatever else they could to get into “good trouble”, a phrase most popularly attributed to John Lewis and his activism efforts. Cooper was arrested twice in 1999 within a matter of weeks while he was protesting for justice over the murder of Amadou Diallo. After a gay couple was bashed in upper Manhattan, he along with his allies at Glaad, the LGBTQ advocacy organization, organized an anti-violence rally. Black people and birds are connected particularly because of our shared history with migration, Cooper says: “Birds and African American history – they weave together in surprising ways. My family left Alabama because there was all this opportunity – the great migration. That’s exactly why birds migrate. Birds leave the south to come to the north because of opportunities seasonally.” He gets enthusiastic when I mention that even before this turning point in US history, Harriet Tubman learned bird calls in order to signal to other freedom seekers when it was safe or unsafe to proceed. He loves this part of her story. The silver lining of “the incident” is that Cooper has met many other Black people who’ve gotten interested in birding, which delights him to no end. Months after the incident happened, he did a PBS special in which he talked about the “joys and challenges of birding while Black” and was featured in the Washington Post about his desire to diversify the activity. Birds have always meant liberation to Cooper. Alongside his memoir, he has a forthcoming National Geographic wildlife show in which he will examine birds across the US, including in his family’s ancestral land of Alabama. He hopes that readers and viewers alike can understand this symbolism. In his own words, as the birds sing above us, “Every place has atmosphere, every place has sky, and they just spread their wings and they can go anywhere. You know, the whole time we’ve been walking and talking, we can walk forward, we can walk back. We can walk left, we can walk right, but we can’t really go up or down very much unless, you know, we’re walking up a hill or down a hill. They just think it and they can go up or down under their own power. That freedom, that ability to think in three dimensions. All of that just makes birds incredibly inspiring.”'}, {'_id': '649099f751ac331455c94720', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/swans-decapitated-attacks-waterfowl-england-wales-crimes-ducks-geese-police', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Swans decapitated amid rising attacks against waterfowl in England and Wales', 'lead': 'Police say 59% increase in crimes against swans, ducks and geese in 2020-22 may be ‘tip of the iceberg’', 'author': 'Mark Tovey', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 09:44:23', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-19 20:09:59.547414', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/6b07cd8f66e5f1d2d89910fee0e6f5f547a9897b/0_147_4500_2700/500.jpg', 'body': 'Nine decapitated swans are among the victims of a rising number of sadistic attacks against waterfowl, according to police data. Police recorded a 59% increase in crimes against swans, ducks and geese from 2020 to 2022. The crimes ranged from fireworks and BB guns being shot into duck ponds to swans and geese being strangled and beheaded. Avon and Somerset police found the remains of two swans in a blood-filled bathtub surrounded by shotgun shells on open land. In Dorset, a decapitated swan was found by an underpass with an arrow sticking out of its body. Neighbouring Devon and Cornwall recorded three separate incidents of swans being decapitated, as well as a goose that had a stable door slammed and bolted on its neck. Three more swans were found with their heads chopped off in London, one in Merseyside and another in Avon and Somerset over the three-year period. A man in Cumbria was arrested after picking a swan up by its neck and throwing it at someone. Ducks have also been attacked. In Merseyside, youths were reported to police for shooting fireworks into a duck pond, while in Essex a mallard died after being shot with a BB gun. Avon and Somerset police said a large number of ducks were found tied up and drowned in the village of Yatton. Police in England and Wales recorded a total of 62 crimes against ducks, swans and geese between 2020 to 2022, based on data accessed under freedom of information laws by the Guardian. There were 27 crimes against these birds in 2022, up from 18 in 2021 and 17 in 2020. Essex (11), Merseyside (11) and Devon and Cornwall (nine) accounted for half of the nationwide tally. The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981 protects wild birds, making it illegal to take, injure or kill them, or to damage or destroy their eggs or nests. Offenders face a maximum penalty of six months in prison and/or an unlimited fine. An RSPCA spokesperson said: “We say we’re a nation of animal lovers and yet every year we see wild animals in our wildlife centres and animal hospitals that have been badly injured or killed after being shot with a gun or catapult for ‘fun’ – or beaten, mutilated or poisoned. “Sadly, we suspect what we are seeing is just the tip of the iceberg, and there may be many more deliberately injured wild animals out there, which are never found and which die a drawn-out, painful death. “There is no place for cruelty to animals in today’s society and we urge anyone who spots suspicious activity when out and about or sees anything online to consult the RSPCA website for advice, or to speak to Crimestoppers or their local police force.” The Witham MP Priti Patel unveiled a memorial bench this year for a family of four swans that were killed by youths with catapults in Coggeshall, Essex. At the event in April, a local resident said: “The four mute swans were very much loved by local people and I am pleased that we have been able to find such a fitting way to commemorate their lives and the very great pleasure they brought to us all by their presence here.”'}, {'_id': '649099f751ac331455c94741', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2023/jun/19/ditching-the-car-for-a-cargo-bike-on-the-school-run', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': '‘In at the deep end’: ditching the car for a cargo bike on the school run', 'lead': 'The price tags can be eye-watering for the electric model I need around my hilly London neighbourhood', 'author': 'Rowena Mason', 'datePublished': '2023-06-19 06:00:05', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-19 20:09:59.548016', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/ef1421ee7092e45032b160cbddd1eb63852dbe8e/0_1444_3499_2099/500.jpg', 'body': 'It’s been 20 years since I last used a bike every day. But I’m returning to cycling because I want to take my children to school and nursery without the horrible sense of guilt from dropping them off in the car, complaints about walking or the juggle of pushchair and public transport at rush-hour. To replace my car on the daily school run, I need an electrically powered workhorse that will carry two smallish children and the bags of stuff that we lug around wherever we go. The options, I’m told, are an elongated cargo bike that fits two children on the back, a detachable trailer, or a trike/bike with a giant child bucket on the front. In an ideal world, it will be powerful enough that I don’t feel dragged down by 30kg of offspring while chugging the household around my hilly London neighbourhood. The longtail electric cargo seems like the best fit for this brief. There are various “car replacement” bikes on the market with eye-watering price tags. The Tern GSD retails at £5k-plus at the top end. The model I choose to try out is a RadWagon, at the cheapest end of the market, though not actually cheap at more like £2,000 with all the necessary attachments. My main concern is whether I can keep my wriggling cargo safe. I spend a long time poring over Google maps to figure out a route that avoids buses and sticks to cycle paths and parks as much as possible. I also research parking, endlessly. And it seems this is one of the main disadvantages of a big, expensive bike. The advice is pretty much never to leave them unattended or on display for long. You can lock them up with as many locks as you like but nothing can stop a determined thief with an angle grinder – even in a public place in broad daylight. I decide it will have to be parked only at home, school or work. Finally, I am ready to borrow the bike from one of the handful of RadWagon partner outlets in London. It has been shipped and taken a week to “build” – the lead time for an order is usually about 10 days. The bikes are extremely popular in the US and mainland Europe but have not been without their problems, including a recall over tyre issues requiring new kit that took some months to be sent. In the UK, there are more than 500 RadWagon owners, and a handful of service outlets in London. Turning up at the shop, I admit I’ve never ridden an electric bike before and the assistant laughs, telling me the RadWagon is going “in at the deep end”. It is a beast, at 2 metres in length and 35kg in weight. But after a short trial round a nearby park, I decide to take the plunge and cycle 45 minutes home. It is in turns both exhilarating and terrifying. At top speed, I am approaching the 25km per hour with little effort on my part. The electric motor makes cycling feel like you’re gliding along. A nimble turn of the “throttle” is enough to almost flatten most hills, with major physical exertion required for only the steepest climbs. The tech is impressive. It has inbuilt lights that switch on with the electrics, a range of 55-88km a charge, an easy-to-read display and the ability to charge your phone on the go. The first hitch comes, though, in deciding where to put it. Outside seems too risky and it won’t fit in the shed. I settle for the hall although this could not be a long-term solution given its bulkiness. This is really a bike for people with garage space or the nerves and insurance to keep it chained in the garden under cover. When it comes to loading on my children, they give it a very positive review as comfy and fun. There are no complaints about the ride to school apart from when I take a speed bump too fast. I’m worried about fights breaking out behind me among tired passengers sitting close together, but they are too busy holding on and enjoying the ride for this to be a problem. The RadWagon is built to fit two Thule Yepp Maxi child seats for the youngest riders up until the age of about five. They are also not cheap and can be tricky to find secondhand but lovely, durable seats and easy to fit. Older children can ride with legs astride the central seat pads if they are confident holding on. Its maximum weight is 54kg, which is equivalent to about two children up to the age of eight or nine. Child-carrying cargo bikes are on the increase in London but they are not prevalent everywhere. The RadWagon attracts a lot of attention and compliments. A teenage boy stops to tell me I have “nice wheels” and I get curious looks from other parents. Several friends come round for a test. One who transports her children by non-electric cargo says she likes it but finds it a bit less responsive than her non-electric bucket bike. I still feel it is quite steady, if slightly cumbersome to wheel because of its size, with a low centre of gravity and thick tyres. It’s time to return the RadWagon and I’m considering whether to buy one of my own. The pull factors are the ease, fun and speed of travel, and the fact the children love it.

The retired police forensics detective is the linchpin of the Jersey Asian Hornet Group (JAHG), a band of two dozen volunteers. These mostly retirees are the frontline troops in a seemingly unwinnable war against an invasive foe – a voracious predator of honeybees and all other flying insects, which has rapidly conquered the west European mainland. But De Carteret, who sports a JAHG polo-shirt and a lanyard showing he is authorised by the government to catch and release Asian hornets (more about the releasing later), is undaunted. “You can’t take your foot off. You’ve got to be dynamic and aggressive. If we get a report, we’re there within half an hour,” he says. Our first call is to a beautiful garden belonging to Tony and Nicky du Feu. Tony has been checking special hornet traps – a coffee cup-like contraption filled with a sugary lure – that he and his wife have placed around Jersey’s north-east corner. Nicky is fuming because her husband has caught three hornets. “It’s quite addictive and it’s quite competitive,” says Tony of their hornet-hunting. This year so far, they have trapped more than 10% of the 208 (and counting) queens caught across Jersey. “If we don’t achieve 10%, we’re not doing our job,” says Nicky. The Du Feus hand the traps to De Carteret. Inside one buzzes a slender, mostly black hornet, which is slightly smaller than the yellower native European hornet. The Asian hornet, Vespa velutina, has an orange face, narrow black wings, yellow legs and yellow-and-black stripes on the underside of its rear end. Remarkably, each individual is believed to be descended from one mated queen, which stowed away in plant pots from China bound for Marseille in 2004. Since then, the species has spread rapidly through France and into Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium. Britain has only had a few incursions – 23 from 2016-22 and four so far this year, which almost certainly hitched a lift on cross-Channel ferries and lorries. But the Jersey volunteers warn that an invasion is coming. There is a whiff of racism about an invading “Asian” hornet – hopefully, the species will become known as the yellow-legged hornet – but it appears to be a genuine threat to wildlife, and a voracious predator. As a beekeeper, Du Feu has watched hornets hovering outside the entrance to his hives, picking off worker bees laden with pollen as they return. Hornets create a landscape of fear, the bees stop foraging, and colonies collapse. But they don’t just threaten honeybees: by late summer, their nests are as big as an extremely large watermelon. French researchers estimated that a single nest can consume 11.3kg of insects over its late-summer lifetime. The economic and human health impacts of the hornets also trouble policymakers: their late-summer search for sugar has been found to damage grapes in Spain, while grape pickers can’t pluck the fruit by hand for fear of getting stung. Jersey, where the Asian hornet was first spotted in 2016, is seeking to repel the insect. If successful, it could give succour to the worried scientists, beekeepers and officials from all parts of Britain and Ireland who have visited the 46-sq mile island in the hope of finding a way to keep it out. Last year, volunteers working with the government detected and destroyed 174 nests. Of these, 117 were after worker hornets had been tracked through the countryside. “This year will show whether we can keep on top of it,” says Bob Tompkins, another JAHG volunteer who is the only islander so far to lose bee hives to the predator. Jersey’s efforts to keep the hornet at bay are both low- and hi-tech, ingenious and simple. The hornets overwinter as queens. In spring, these queens emerge and build their first, small nests. France is 14 miles from Jersey’s east coast, and while large numbers of hornets are unlikely to cross the Channel to Britain by flying, they can easily reach the island assisted by east and north-easterly winds. Every spring and summer, the volunteers must catch the emerging queens before they build nests and their numbers explode. A network of government-funded traps are hung across the island and must be checked every day to remove live bycatch – the last thing the volunteers want to do is kill more flying insects. Each captured queen is put in a freezer to kill it. The body is preserved and pinned by a volunteer researcher – this could be valuable data for future research. My next stop with De Carteret is to a queen’s early-summer nest, which has been reported as dangling above someone’s front door. “To me, this is like scene-of-crime work – going to one scene after another,” says De Carteret. “It gets you hooked.” This “embryo” nest is the size of a lightbulb and looks like a pretty paper lantern. We wait for 15 minutes but no hornet appears. There is no point destroying a nest without a queen. So De Carteret will return at dusk and put the little nest into a big container – if the queen is still alive, she will be inside at dusk, and captured. The key to finding hornets is to inform the public, says De Carteret. Thanks to plenty of media coverage on the island – and his popular Facebook page – many Jersey islanders can now identify them. “People need to know what these insects look like,” says De Carteret. “It’s a big problem but it’s a community problem.” His mobile rings constantly. The next call is from Jo Burke, who reports a suspected Asian hornet in her utility room on the south edge of the island. “I came back from walking the dog, heard a buzz and this huge great big thing flew towards me,” says Burke. “I thought, ‘I don’t like the look of that’ so I retreated. I went straight to the website and it said something about an orange face, and I thought, ‘that might be one’. It’s exciting but not in a good way. It’s not what we want on the island.” She is right: it’s a queen. De Carteret collects a small Perspex pot from his car and enters the utility room. The hornet is on the windowsill. He deftly covers it with the pot and slips on the lid. He’s not wearing any gloves or protective gear – only when trapped does the hornet buzz angrily. He has never been stung by an Asian hornet but he knows two people who were hospitalised after stings. De Carteret and his volunteers dislike sensationalist coverage and stress that the hornet is only aggressive if you get close to a big late-summer nest, when it wants to defend its offspring. In spring and early summer, the queens are laden with eggs and docile. “They are an incredibly successful insect,” he says. The volunteers’ battle intensifies in midsummer when the first workers emerge. First, they trap a worker with the usual lure. Then they mark it with special paint used by beekeepers to mark bees, release it, and set their watches. (It is an offence under Jersey law to release Asian hornets unless authorised.) Workers become habituated on the sugary lures, making shuttle runs between the traps and their nest. De Carteret discovered that it takes roughly one minute for a worker to fly 100 metres back to its nest and return again. It’s like map-making, he explains: a process of triangulation. Volunteers log times and distances on WhatsApp and work along the line of the hornet’s route until they find the nest. They also attach feathers or tiny streamers to workers to make them more visible in flight. It’s time-consuming fieldcraft: Tony and Nicky du Feu reckon it takes them 20 hours combined to find a single nest. Radio tags have been successfully used after trials by University of Exeter researchers, but so far the Jersey volunteers have found it a 45-minute fiddle to fit a tiny tracker to a hornet, which must be chilled before being revived. This year, however, the group’s researcher has devised a way of tying radio tags to hornets in just five minutes. Once located, summer nests must be destroyed as quickly as possible before a fresh generation of next year’s queens emerge. Destroying them isn’t simple: big nests are ferociously defended, and they are often in tall trees, so professional climbers are called in. Last summer, government climbers were not always available, leading to four-week delays in destroying nests on some occasions, which frustrated volunteers. Alastair Christie is the Jersey government’s senior scientific officer, responsible for invasive species, as well as a beekeeper himself. Managing his “extraordinary” volunteers is sometimes like “herding cats” he laughs, but he says he and all of Jersey are “tremendously grateful” for their efforts. This year, he has contracted and trained two tree surgery companies to do the climbing to minimise delays. He and his volunteers have also mastered the use of a telescopic lance which last year successfully injected poison into a nest 26 metres above the ground – minimising the need for professional tree-climbers. Success, he says, is restricting numbers to a manageable level. He agrees with volunteers that this is a “pivotal” year. If hornet numbers rise too high in midsummer, it becomes impossible to track individuals to nests because there are too many nests in different directions. “This year, it could turn into the exponential phase [of hornet numbers in Jersey],” he warns. “If we’ve worked our socks off, taken out 200 nests and there’s a sense that there are still another 20 nests out there, it all indicates we’re gradually losing control. Then we have to look at what is sustainable. Because this has to go on for ever. There’s no magic bullet, and for ever is rather a long time.” Given that the battle against the hornet appears to have been lost in mainland Europe, shouldn’t we simply accept it alongside other invasive non-native species, from grey squirrels to Japanese knotweed? “If it was good for our environment here it would’ve been here all along,” says Matt Goetz, curator for invertebrates at Jersey zoo. “We have the European hornet here, and that’s the hornet that fits into our environment. A hornet evolved in Asia has a different reproductive output and different behaviour. It might not have the properties that mean that predators go for it. It might have bigger nests than our European hornet. It might have a bigger appetite, and eat species that aren’t adapted to cope with the pressure. That’s particularly problematic in already damaged environments. “With invasive species, if they have a way in and can reproduce in small numbers it’s very hard to completely eradicate them but you can keep on top of it. By trying, you are gaining so much knowledge and experience that you often find a way to have permanent success.” In addition, says Goetz, such efforts are often transferable to other invasive species or ecological problems. “It is absolutely and categorically never in vain. Even if it doesn’t 100% work, you get so much experience and the public sensitised to the issues – people join in the radio tracking and become conservationists, or Jersey zoo staff.” In a way, the Asian hornet is a recruitment tool for conservation and the cause of flying insects. While Christie believes the British government is taking the right approach by using beekeepers as its eyes and ears, Jersey volunteers are sceptical about Britain’s chances of keeping the Asian hornet at bay. By the end of the day, De Carteret has incarcerated eight more hornets. The following day 11 queens are discovered – a daily record. Either hornet numbers are booming or the volunteers are becoming more efficient at trapping them, or both. De Carteret tries to remain optimistic. “We’re definitely suppressing the numbers,” he says. But what happens if they reach Britain? “I dread to think,” says Tompkins. “We are a very small island, we’ve got a good local knowledge base of the environment and where things are. There’s very little space on this island that isn’t observed. “In Britain, if they ever got into the New Forest for instance, they could tick away there for several years without being noticed, get established, and then off and away.” If you suspect you have seen an Asian hornet in the UK report the sighting through the iPhone and Android app Asian Hornet Watch or by using this online report form.'}, {'_id': '649099f751ac331455c94767', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/19/australia-needs-to-reduce-emissions-to-net-zero-by-2038-to-do-fair-share-to-contain-global-heating-analysis-shows', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Australia needs to reduce emissions to net zero by 2038 to do ‘fair share’ to contain global heating, analysis shows', 'lead': '<strong>Exclusive</strong>: Researchers say government’s climate schedule needs to be brought forward by a decade to keep heating to 1.5C', 'author': 'Graham Readfearn', 'datePublished': '2023-06-18 22:57:46', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-19 20:09:59.548672', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/01a31b7d983e658c01ecc880638e91f40caa4a70/0_156_4666_2800/500.jpg', 'body': 'Australia’s fair share of action to give the world a chance of keeping global heating to 1.5C would mean reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2038 – more than a decade ahead of the government’s schedule, according to new scientific analysis. To stay on track to keep global heating of 1.5C within reach – a goal the climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen has described as vital – Australia’s 2035 target would need to see a cut of 90% on 2005 levels by 2035, the analysis says. The research, from two leading scientists who contributed to the UN climate panel’s assessment of how quickly global emissions will need to drop, points to how far Australia has to go to legitimately claim its targets are in line with the 1.5C goal. The Albanese government has already updated the country’s target to a 43% cut on 2005 levels by 2030 – an improvement on the Morrison government’s 26% commitment. In a briefing report commissioned by WWF-Australia, associate professor Malte Meinshausen and Dr Zebedee Nicholls of Climate Resource say the improved target would need to have been “at least 67%” to have been in line with 1.5C. While Australia has a net zero target by 2050, Meinshausen and Nicholls say this net zero date should be 2038 based on Australia’s “fair share” of effort. Nicholls said: “We are at the point where we need to be going for maximum possible ambition. Every mitigation option that we have we need to look at seriously. “This is the minimum that Australia should be looking at if we’re serious about 1.5C.” The concept of what a “fair share” of effort represents is contested and not agreed between countries. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The new analysis considers how much the entire planet could emit – known as the carbon budget – while giving a 50% chance of keeping global temperatures to 1.5C. The new analysis gives Australia a 0.97% share of that global budget, a figure taken from a 2014 Climate Change Authority report that sees developed countries making faster cuts to allow developing countries more time to decarbonise. That 0.97% share is considered generous, the authors said, because Australia makes up only 0.33% of the planet’s population. According to Climate Resource, the government’s current plans would lead to 7.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent being released by Australia between 2021 and 2050, which was “roughly double” a budget of 4bn tonnes “for a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C.” Prof Frank Jotzo, a climate policy expert at Australian National University, said it was “impossible to pin down” what the “fair share” of any country’s efforts on emissions reductions would look like “because there are so many value judgments that need to be made”. But he said to pass any “plausibility test” for a 1.5C-aligned commitment, emissions reductions would need to be “extremely rapid, deep and sustained” and Australia’s current policy ambition was “not in line with 1.5C”. Keeping global temperatures close to 1.5C would reduce the impacts of heatwaves, sea level rise, temperature extremes and give ecosystems such as Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef a better chance of avoiding collapse. The government will set its 2035 target in 2025 after the Climate Change Authority issues advice in 2024. The authority is in the middle of a community consultation process on that issue. Last month, the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, wrote to Unesco to promote the federal and Queensland government’s steps to conserve the reef after a UN-backed monitoring mission called for a series of new measures. In the letter, Plibersek wrote the government was committed to setting “successively more ambitious emissions reduction targets” that would be “in alignment with efforts to limit global temperature increase to 1.5C”. Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF-Australia, said: “Australia needs to do its fair share. We can’t expect the rest of the world to do the heavy lifting to save the Great Barrier Reef. Australia has to set the example and give the reef a fighting chance.” In a statement, Unesco said together with its science advisers it was finalising an assessment of the reef that was “expected to be public in July” and “a final decision over whether Australia’s commitments are sufficient or not will be decided by the world heritage committee in September”. Guardian Australia asked minister’s Bowen’s office if the government considered its 2050 date for net zero to be in line with the country’s “fair share” of global effort to keep temperatures to 1.5C, and what criteria it would use to make that assessment. Those questions were not answered, but a spokesperson said the government was implementing strong policies to achieve its “ambitious” 2030 and 2050 targets. Under the new Climate Change Act, the Climate Change Authority’s advice on the 2035 target to be updated in 2025 would give “specific consideration to the temperature goals” of the Paris agreement, the spokesperson said. Queensland is the largest-emitting state but its 2030 emissions reduction target remains stuck at 30% by 2030 and well behind other states. The Queensland environment minister, Leanne Linard, said 2021 data showed the state had almost reached its 2030 goal “nine years ahead of time” and the government was “committed to meeting its overall goal of zero net emissions by 2050, in line with leading global economies”.'}, {'_id': '649099f751ac331455c9476d', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/18/flood-warnings-issued-for-england-as-parts-of-the-north-are-deluged', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Flood warnings issued for England as parts of the north are deluged', 'lead': 'As much as 35mm of rain fell in an hour near Sheffield and Met Office says weather could get even worse ', 'author': 'Tom Ambrose and agency', 'datePublished': '2023-06-18 21:51:28', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-19 20:09:59.548774', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/8cbb031db95e2c88dedcbe64c7b889700ffe309e/108_0_3285_1972/500.jpg', 'body': 'Flood warnings will be in place across England going into Monday morning after almost half a month’s worth of rain fell in one hour on Sunday. Thunder and lightning swept across the north throughout the evening, as 35.6mm of rain fell in Woodhouse Mill, near Sheffield between 6pm and 7pm. In June so far, the UK has averaged 12 days of rain, totalling 77mm, PA Media reported. Rain and thunderstorms caused the Met Office to issue six flood warnings on Sunday night, with forecaster Marco Petagna warning the weather could get even worse. “Half a month’s of rain has fallen in one hour in one location, in quite a few spots we’re seeing 15-20mm, even 30mm in an hour,” he said on Sunday night. “There’s been quite a few storms embedded within that area of northern England, Northern Ireland and one or two in parts of Wales. “It’s pretty torrential, 25 to 35mm in an hour is certainly going to cause some flooding problems, and there’s still potentially bad conditions to come.” The rain caused play to be halted in the first Ashes Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham due to the wet weather, and it was reported people had to be rescued from flooding in Yorkshire. A yellow thunderstorm warning almost entirely covered England and Wales between noon and midnight, and there was also one until 9pm in Northern Ireland. It warned of heavy showers, the potential for frequent lightning, strong winds and hail – which could cause flooding, travel issues and power cuts. In northern England and Scotland, a yellow heavy rain warning is in place from 7pm on Sunday until noon on Monday. There are generally moderate or high UV levels across the UK, despite there being more cloud, while grass and nettle pollen are also very strong, the Met Office said. Temperatures reached the low 20s – despite the UK being in an area of low pressure. Sarah Cook of the Environment Agency said: “On Sunday afternoon and into the night, slow-moving heavy showers and thunderstorms could lead to localised surface water flooding across England. “Environment Agency teams are out on the ground and will support local authorities in responding to surface water flooding.” The Environment Agency said it believed flooding was possible across the Midlands and parts of Yorkshire and the Humber, and east and south-east England.

The Labour leader will seek to regain the initiative on his plan for green growth on Monday, having rowed back earlier this month on a pledge to invest £28bn in a green industrial strategy, a figure that will not now be reached until the second half of a Labour parliament, as well as damaging rows with trade unions over the future of the North Sea. Announcing a package of policies designed to decarbonise the energy system and industry, Starmer will say: “We’re going to throw everything at this: planning reform, procurement, long-term finance, R&amp;D, a strategic plan for skills and supply chains … Pulling together for a simple, unifying priority: British power for British jobs.” Labour’s plans include sweeping changes to the planning system that will allow onshore wind farms, electricity lines, transport links and other low-carbon infrastructure to be built quickly. All regulators will be given instructions to prioritise low-carbon projects, and companies will be given assurances on long-term policy to encourage investment. Speaking in Scotland, Starmer will contrast the opportunities for investing in a low-carbon economy with the devastation of the UK’s industrial heartlands under Margaret Thatcher. “This cannot be a re-run of the 1980s,” he will say. “This is the race of our lifetime, and the prize is real.” Labour’s plans for renewable energy, including a ban on new oil and gas exploration and development in the North Sea, have come under attack, from the Conservatives and trade unions. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, accused the Labour leader of being “the political wing” of Just Stop Oil. Starmer will counter by arguing net zero is vital to the UK’s safety. “We live in an increasingly volatile world. The twin risks of climate change and energy security now threaten the stability of nations,” he will say. “So we’ve got to ground everything we do in a new insight – that clean energy is now essential for national security.” His team also rebuffed suggestions of a U-turn on the North Sea oil ban. Rescinding permission for projects that have cleared all regulatory hurdles before the general election would be costly and legally complex, so the party’s proposed ban on new oilfields will not cover projects that have achieved all three levels of consent, for exploration, development and production. It is unlikely that many of the more than 100 North Sea licences the government is mulling would fall into that category, though one of the biggest – the Rosebank oil and gas field – could clear the final regulatory hurdles soon. Labour’s plans also include insulating 19 million homes, setting up a national energy company, decarbonising electricity supply by 2030 and a national wealth fund to invest in green infrastructure. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, told the Guardian the package would transform the UK’s economy. “This is a transformative agenda to bring lower bills, more jobs, energy security and climate leadership,” he said. “Labour is seizing the future, in stark contrast to the Tories, who have abandoned the pitch on this agenda.” New analysis by Carbon Brief found less gas would be imported by 2030 under Labour’s plans than under Tory policies, despite the proposed ban on new North Sea drilling. Planning policies for onshore wind and pylon construction are devolved to the Scottish and Welsh governments: in Wales, the Labour-led government is likely to be willing partners on this strategy. In Scotland, Labour needs to negotiate with the Scottish National party and Scottish Green government in Edinburgh, but would expect its support. Labour’s plans met approval from Sam Richards, former Tory party adviser to Boris Johnson. “It’s great news that Keir Starmer has put reforming our broken planning system at the heart of Labour’s plans to deliver the clean energy infrastructure that can cut our energy bills and create jobs,” said Richards, the founder of the campaign group Britain Remade. “I’m delighted that Labour have adopted many of the recommendations set out in [our March] report, from ending the senseless ban on new onshore wind farms to speeding up the time it takes to get offshore wind farms up and running.” Starmer’s choice of Edinburgh for the launch reflects Labour’s need to win seats from the SNP as well as the Tories in England. A new Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times put the SNP and Labour neck and neck on 34%, suggesting Labour is on course to win 26 Westminster seats in Scotland. It currently holds one in Scotland. The headquarters of the new state-owned energy company GB Energy promised by Labour is to be based in Scotland, in a signal to Scottish voters the country would benefit directly from a UK Labour government. Starmer will say: “Neither [SNP nor Tories] are truly invested in Scotland’s success. For the SNP, any Scottish triumph in Britain is a threat to the ultimate prize. While the Tories welcome such division because they think it works for them, politically.”'}, {'_id': '648c584d51ac33b515b4a66c', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/one-of-britains-largest-sunken-forests-reveals-its-secrets-aoe', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'One of Britain’s largest sunken forests reveals its secrets', 'lead': 'Pett Level on England’s south coast was once full of oak, elm and ash trees.

Easily missed among the boulders and rock pools, a landscape of gnarled black stumps and enormous fallen tree trunks is revealed and submerged twice a day in a bay between Hastings and Rye. Twisted and smoothed by the tides, the soggy wood is strewn with barnacles and peppered with thousands of holes made by piddocks – burrowing shellfish which have made the logs their home. But this is not just driftwood. These are ancient trees, their stumps still rooted to the spot where they died due to rising sea levels up to 6,500 years ago. The site, at Pett Level in Rye Bay, East Sussex, is one of the UK’s largest sunken forests and would have once formed an extensive area of coastal woodland stretching more than five miles to the east to Rye Harbour and about eight miles to the west, towards Bexhill. Just yards from the witchy burls and branches of the sunken forest, fossilised dinosaur footprints made by iguanodons and ankylosaurus up to 100m years ago can be found in boulders that have fallen from the crumbling cliffs. Today, a tall embankment holds back the sea waters from the acres of reclaimed land that make up Pett Level. But over the millennia, the rising waters that made an island of Britain and a sea out of the river valley that became the Channel, also rose high enough to swamp the forest, killing the trees. Once scarcely studied, the sunken forest is now yielding its secrets to scientists examining how climate breakdown at the end of the last ice age radically altered landscapes and environments as sea levels rose and the climate warmed. Dr Scott Timpany, a paleoecologist at the University of the Highlands and Islands and an expert on sunken forests around Britain, says the ancient wood contained substantial numbers of oak trees at certain points in its history, as well as elm, beech and yew. “These would have been wet woodlands – not like a park woodland. This would have been a pretty boggy, wet environment with pools of water on the surface in places. This would likely have been getting wetter as sea levels rose, as glaciers melted, raising the groundwater table. “The woodland remains we see today are from lots of different periods of time,” he adds. “On the surface of the intertidal zone at the moment, you’ve got oak trees that date from the late Mesolithic all the way through to oak, elm and ash from the middle bronze age. “As you go down the beach you’re effectively stepping back in time.” As recently as 1850, historian William Durrant Cooper wrote that the sunken remains of “Dymsdale Forest” – as it was once known – can only be seen “at low water, during spring tides”. Less than 200 years later, no spring tides are required to see what remains of the woodland. Visitors can wander down to the beach at low tide and poke at the spongy tree trunks, which fell long before Stonehenge or the Giza pyramids were built. As well as the ravages of winter storms, rising sea levels and the interplay of three rivers coming together in Rye, the coast is moulded by longshore drift – the relentless eastwards flow of shingle, the pebbles that define the beaches of much of Britain’s south coast. This is of particular concern to commercial shipping at Rye Harbour. Large container vessels navigate a narrow channel at the mouth of the River Rother, the opening of which would be rapidly blocked by the flow of shingle if left unchecked. Any buildup would also have serious consequences for the reclaimed land at Pett Level, Romney Marsh and the area immediately around Rye. To address this, a concrete arm protecting the entrance to the harbour traps the shingle, and a fleet of tipper trucks remove up to 80,000 tonnes of the pebbles every year, transporting them five miles west to protect the sea wall at Pett Level, in a perpetual battle between the forces of nature and the Environment Agency. “I would estimate that without this effort, within three years the sea would be punching a hole through the sea wall, and all of Pett Level would become saltmarsh,” says Barry Yates, former manager of Rye Harbour nature reserve. The effects of human activity on longshore drift continue to play a significant role in how the coastline changes, and may be a key reason why the sunken forest has become so exposed in recent decades. The creation of a concrete harbour arm in Hastings in the early 20th century cut off much of the eastward flow of shingle. In turn, this reduced the volume of shingle covering the base of the cliffs between Hastings and Pett Level, thereby exposing the cliffs to the sea and increasing the rate of erosion. Yates says: “The cliffs are marching inland as they erode, and it’s the base of the cliffs which dictate where the root of the developing shingle ridge starts. Over time, the cliff has been eaten away, so the starting point of the shingle ridge east of the cliffs has moved northwards and that uncovers all of the peat and the old trees that are there.” Maps of the coastline here at different points over the past few centuries clearly show that whole towns, such as Old Winchelsea, have been lost, and how rivers have substantially rerouted themselves. “We have this sense that everything’s here for ever, but it’s not at all,” says local author Gareth E Rees, whose forthcoming book, Sunken Lands, explores humanity’s long relationship with cataclysmic climate breakdown. “When we look at the sunken forest – at this incredible thing that existed and was powerful, full of life and ancestors and animals and hunters, it disappeared. It’s gone,” says Rees. “We’re also going to have to let things go. There’s a false security in building more and more dykes and barriers. You can’t keep adding engineering solutions.” Yates agrees. “Although we have kept things in place for now by carting shingle up and down, inevitably, the sea and the elements are going to have their way. This bit of coast should be mobile, and the plants and animals have ways of coping with that.” But he says the shifting coastline also serves as a warning. “Most of the ice from the last glaciation has melted, but the last bit that still exists is going to have a huge impact. Most people in the world live at low sea level. We just aren’t awake to that. “I don’t know what it is going to take for people to realise what needs to be done.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features'}, {'_id': '648c584d51ac33b515b4a68d', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/uk-lagging-behind-in-global-race-to-decarbonise-says-tuc-leader', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'UK lagging behind in global race to decarbonise, says TUC leader', 'lead': 'Paul Nowak says workers need a seat at the table to ensure a quick and fair transition to a net zero economy', 'author': 'Matthew Taylor Environment correspondent', 'datePublished': '2023-06-16 06:00:37', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-16 14:40:45.112795', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/927f066229a53500533ec26191808ae934e07867/0_246_2891_1735/500.jpg', 'body': 'The UK is in danger of being left behind in the global race to decarbonise the economy with potentially disastrous consequences for jobs and communities, according to the TUC’s general secretary. In an interview, Paul Nowak said the UK was “limping towards a green future” and he called for a “national collective effort” involving employers, workers and the government to ensure a quick and fair transition to a net zero economy. “All of our unions are signed up to delivering net zero … from schools to hospitals to the steel industry, our members are working day in, day out to make sure this transition happens and is done in a way that is fair and just,” he said. The role of trade unions in the UK’s net zero transition hit the headlines this month when leader of the GMB, Gary Smith, criticised Labour’s plan to ban oil and gas expansion, saying it was “naive”. Smith said the party had “got it wrong” and that his members had been promised tens of thousands of jobs in renewable energy “time and time again” but that they “simply have not emerged”. Nowak declined to be drawn into the row but said it underlined the need for workers – including those in the oil and gas industry – to have a seat at the table “to shape concrete plans for the future”. He said change “must be done with people rather than to them” if the country was to avoid a rerun of the devastation caused by the deindustrialisation of the 1980s. “Growing up in Merseyside in the 1980s, I saw what happens when you don’t manage industrial transition effectively,” he said. “Right across Britain’s industrial heartlands we can see the scarring effect of long-term unemployment and cities and towns are still recovering. We are absolutely clear that we have to get to net zero in a way that supports and creates good quality jobs and gives people a sense of agency in how that transition can be delivered.” Nowak, who took up the post of general secretary in January, grew up in Merseyside and worked as a call centre operator, a hotel night porter and a supermarket worker before becoming a dedicated trade unionist. He said an ideological aversion to state action meant the current Tory government – unlike its counterparts in the US and Europe – was failing to set out a coherent strategy to decarbonise, instead leaving the issue to fractured, market-led interventions. “I just don’t think you can leave these huge industrial transformations to the market and think everything is just going to work out … We are limping towards a green future rather than having a government with a real sense of purpose,” he said. Pressure for action on the climate in the UK in recent years has come from direct action campaigns, protests and youth strikes – from Extinction Rebellion to Just Stop Oil. In recent months, some trade unions have made common cause with climate campaigners, with both groups arguing that the cost of living crisis and ecological breakdown have the same root cause – an economic system that exploits natural resources and people for the benefit of a wealthy few. Nowak said unions “can and do work together” with climate campaigners, with both groups prioritising “a positive long-term future for everyone” over short-term private profits for a few. But he acknowledged there were differences of politics and outlook between the two, with “union activity focused on the workplace”. “Our credibility is rooted in those millions of union members whose work will be affected by the transition to net zero,” he said. “So constructive dialogue between us is important where we have differing views from some climate campaigners, such as our view that there is an important future role for nuclear energy.” Nowak is confident that the trade union movement has the capacity and expertise to ensure a just transition – if workers are given a seat at the table from the start. “This is as transformational as the railways or electricity – not just for energy intensive industries but for every sector from public to private … But in the 150 years of our history we have overseen huge change and transition and we have the ability to do the same again this time.” The TUC has appointed two new project officers for worker-led transitions to net zero – one in the steel industry and the other in motor manufacturing. Nowak said the drive to net zero could not be at the expense of the UK’s industrial base and said overseeing the decarbonisation of energy intensive industries such as steel, ceramics and chemicals was as important as ensuring good jobs in the newer industries such as solar and wind. “It is about making sure our members have good, secure jobs not just next year or in five years’ time but in 15, 20 years’ time – our members know that the jobs they will be doing and their kids will be doing will be shaped by what we do in the here and now.” Nowak said anti-union laws and a culture among employers of keeping trade unions and workers at arms length were making it difficult to organise in the fast-growing wind and solar industries. But he said there were signs that Labour was developing a more coherent net zero strategy, linking a new deal for workers to trade policies and industrial strategy. Starmer is expected to make highly skilled green jobs a central plank of his clean energy pitch later this month, though Labour has been criticised for scaling back plans to borrow £28bn a year to invest in the transition. Nowak said a successful transition could not be cooked up by politicians in Westminster or business leaders in boardrooms – or even trade union leaders in endless meetings. “This is not about me or the TUC or a few union leaders. What trade unions bring to the table is a network of tens of thousands of union reps up down the country that can be actively mobilised to help shape what this green future will look like,” he said. “That is a resource that no government should ignore and no employer should ignore.”'}, {'_id': '648c584d51ac33b515b4a696', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/roger-payne-60-years-discovery-of-whale-song-their-haunting-sounds-reveal-new-secrets', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Almost 60 years after the discovery of whale song, their haunting sounds reveal new secrets', 'lead': 'In 1967, Roger Payne, who has died at 88, noticed that the mammals’ calls were organised in repeating patterns, spurring the discovery of whale song', 'author': 'Sophy Grimshaw', 'datePublished': '2023-06-16 05:00:36', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-16 14:40:45.112961', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/e003a3a3c136469a78713cea5e52a4184f1d4e06/233_951_4645_2787/500.jpg', 'body': 'The idea that whales “sing”, commonly accepted today, is relatively recent. Until the late 1960s it was thought that whale noises were nothing more than expressive sounds or calls. But in 1967, a discovery by the marine biologist Roger Payne, who died last Saturday, changed our understanding – ushering in a new way of looking at the world’s largest mammals. As the young Payne listened on repeat for days to recordings made of humpback sounds captured underwater off the coast of Bermuda, he noticed the calls were organised in repeating patterns. Speaking to Guardian Seascape in 2020, he described it as his “wow” moment, spurring on the discovery – made alongside other researchers – that all whale species “sing” in some rhythmic form, even in the “clicks” of toothed whales, such as sperm whales. Some whales even use the sonata form, common to human music: a theme, followed by a variation, then a return to the theme. The zoologist Katy Payne – Roger’s collaborator (and former wife) – would go on to prove that whales use what can be described as rhyme, a technique whales seem to use to remember long and complex sections of repeating patterns, topped and tailed with “end phrases”. Katy Payne showed humpback whales in a given area sing different versions of the same song – essentially a “hit” – that changes slightly throughout the course of the season. Indeed, it was the humpback – toothless baleen whales, with fleshy, concertina-like jaws – that quickly stood out as the most prolific cetacean singer, creating songs that are also emotionally affecting to human beings. Why whales sing is still not comprehensively clear, but Roger Payne soon observed differences between their songs and their other social sounds: for example, between the “almost whispering” tone of mothers communicating to calves, and the long, loud broadcasts of males seeking a mate. It is primarily males that sing songs, though there are some recordings of females singing, too. The role of whale song in mating is still not fully understood. In 2020 Stanford University researchers found that blue whales sing at different times of day and night as their migration behaviour changes – though, again, precisely why is unclear. What is known is that, given the distances whales travel in deep ocean, the volume and “broadcast” quality of song is key. Roger Payne’s assertion, early in his career, that a blue whale, in deep ocean free from human noise pollution, could transmit a song that might be heard by another whale as far as 13,000 miles away, was so controversial among biologists that he described the reaction as almost “career-ending”. Another theory of his was that music might predate human life, given that whales predate humans in evolutionary terms. In his later years, Payne became interested in how technology might help to decipher a vocabulary of “whale speak”, if enough samples could be gathered – though he stopped short of using the term “language” as it was too open to being misconstrued.'}, {'_id': '648c584d51ac33b515b4a699', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/action-to-tackle-air-pollution-failing-to-keep-up-with-research', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Action to tackle air pollution failing to keep up with research', 'lead': 'Globally, outdoor air pollution is second only to tobacco as greatest cause of lung and respiratory cancers', 'author': 'Gary Fuller', 'datePublished': '2023-06-16 05:00:36', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-16 14:40:45.113016', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/68eeaf1d0f9c88836dde45cde7f0ad723f83bd2b/0_0_5555_3334/500.jpg', 'body': 'This year marks a decade since the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) gathered in Lyon, France, to unanimously declare that air pollution caused cancer in humans. Air pollution was classified as a type 1 carcinogen, the most certain category possible. This was mainly based on more than 20 years of research in particle pollution and lung cancer. The number of research studies has almost doubled since the IARC meeting in Lyon, with even more evidence on lung cancer in never-smokers, but governmental action to reduce air pollution has not kept up. Globally, outdoor air pollution is second only to tobacco as the greatest cause of lung and respiratory cancers. This holds true in almost all parts of the world, with a notable exception of low-income countries where people (especially women and children) also breathe smoke in their homes from cooking on open fires. In the past 10 years new studies have linked air pollution to other cancers, including breast and bladder cancer. These have also been associated with nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant from diesel traffic that is being targeted by low emissions zones in many cities. There is emerging evidence of links to childhood leukaemia too. For those people with lung cancer, smokers and never-smokers, their prognosis and survival appears to be reduced if they live in a polluted area. Research includes a recent study of more than a quarter of a million people with lung cancer in Pennsylvania. This raises questions about the impact of air pollution on the way that cancer progresses and how it may change the effectiveness of chemotherapy. In 2020, Dr Michelle Turner of ISGlobal, the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, led a review of evidence on cancer and air pollution. She said: “Actions to reduce outdoor air pollution will reduce lung cancer in both smokers and in non-smokers. They may also improve survival from lung cancer, especially in those diagnosed in earlier stages of the disease. A study from the UK’s Francis Crick Institute found that living for three years in an area of higher particle pollution might be sufficient to promote growth of EGFR-driven lung cancer, a type of cancer common in never- and light-smokers.” Across the UK, about 3,500 cancer deaths were attributed to air pollution in 2015. These are not spread evenly. Air pollution affects us all, but some communities are affected more than others. Greatest concentrations are often found in the poorest communities and also in areas with the highest proportion of black, Asian and multiple ethnicities. Turner explained: “Recent studies have shown stronger associations of ambient air pollution and lung cancer risk in lower-socioeconomic neighbourhoods where there are higher air pollution levels. There is an urgent worldwide need for multiple, multi-level public health and policy interventions to improve outdoor air for lung cancer prevention and to reduce disparities in the disease”. Last year the UK set a target to reduce the worst PM2.5 particle pollution in England to 10 micrograms per cubic metre by 2040. The EU is discussing a proposal to meet this target by 2030. This is double the World Health Organization guideline. Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, from the University of Southampton, said: “Air pollution increases the risk of lung and other types of cancer including breast, liver and pancreas. Overall, the American Cancer Association for Cancer Research states that for every 10 micrograms per cubic of increased exposure to PM2.5, the risk of dying from any cancer rises by 22%.”'}, {'_id': '648c584d51ac33b515b4a69d', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/16/country-diary-a-female-goosander-is-left-to-defend-her-ducklings-alone', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Country diary: A female goosander mother is left to defend her ducklings alone | Phil Gates', 'lead': '<strong>St John’s Chapel, Weardale:</strong> Unlike migrating drakes, females like this one can’t simply fly off when we approach her brood on the river', 'author': 'Phil Gates', 'datePublished': '2023-06-16 04:30:35', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-16 14:40:45.113094', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/1d85ec99d51b0866d414524c4abb88a91633e071/0_104_1559_936/500.jpg', 'body': 'Outside the breeding season, goosanders are usually wary birds, liable to take flight at the first inkling of an approaching human threat.

We surprised her as we crossed the narrow footbridge over the River Wear. She had nine ducklings, not long out of their hollow-tree nest, and now they were trapped between us and a low waterfall that tumbled over a rocky ledge. In winter, she would have flown away in an instant, but now she would not even swim her way out of trouble. Her ducklings, as buoyant as corks, could not swim up the waterfall and were constantly swept downstream towards us by the force of its flow. A goosander in a state of high anxiety, swimming in circles with her charges huddled around her, climbing on to her back. Where was the father? Back in the 1980s, it was proven that British goosander drakes, identified by tags and coloured dyes, undertake a long summer moulting migration to Scandinavia. He would have left the nest as soon as she began to incubate eggs, more than a month ago, and may now be loafing around in the Tanafjord in Norway, in the company of 35,000 others from western Europe, moulting out of their dapper bottle green, pink and white breeding plumage into drabber feathers. With luck, he’ll be back in November to father some more ducklings. Why fly so far to moult? Goosanders only colonised Scotland in the 1870s, spreading into the border county rivers and northern England 50 years ago. The drakes’ long summer migration might be a legacy of their earlier, more restricted continental distribution. As for the females, there’s not enough time to join their consorts in Scandinavia after they’ve raised their ducklings here, so they stay on our rivers to moult in winter eclipse plumage. We left our single-parent goosander in peace, crossing the bridge quickly so that she and her flotilla could pass underneath. With danger gone, the family white-water rafted between the boulders, bobbing downriver towards calmer waters. • Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary'}, {'_id': '648c584d51ac33b515b4a6bb', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/just-stop-oil-protesters-glyndebourne-opera-festival', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Just Stop Oil protesters interrupt opera at Glyndebourne festival', 'lead': 'Three activists use glitter cannons and air horns during performance of Poulenc’s Dialogues des Carmélites', 'author': 'Nadeem Badshah', 'datePublished': '2023-06-15 20:01:29', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-16 14:40:45.113806', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/554775162d9adbccec8bedadb495c0f73bf5e465/0_215_768_461/500.jpg', 'body': 'Just Stop Oil protesters have interrupted a performance during the Glyndebourne opera festival in East Sussex by letting off glitter cannons and blowing air horns.

The move by the UN to require anyone registering for the summit to declare their affiliation was heralded as a victory for transparency by campaigners who have been increasingly concerned at the growing presence of oil and gas lobbyists at climate talks. Scott Kirby, a campaigner from Youngo, which represents youth campaigners at the UN climate talks, said: “When young people see the number of fossil fuel lobbyists present at UN Framework Convention on Climate Change conferences, it makes us question the ability this process has to solve the biggest challenge threatening our futures. This is why we welcome the step to increase transparency of observer interests in the talks.” Many campaigners said the change to make potential conflicts of interest more apparent should be only a first step towards excluding fossil fuel companies from the talks, or from key parts of them. Hwei Mian Lim, of the Women and Gender Constituency, said: “We can only meaningfully tackle the climate crisis when we kick big polluters out. Fortunately, we have the real solutions, including gender-just climate solutions, and have the power in collective feminist movements to prevent untold suffering, in particular among women and girls in the global south. “This is strengthened with weeding out the undue influence of big polluters that seek to undermine climate action. Cop28 is our best chance to start implementing them and we must do so in the most gender responsive, and effective and impactful way.” The change came as nations wrapped up nearly two weeks of talks in Bonn, where officials tried to lay the groundwork for Cop28, which starts on 30 November. The event will be held in the United Arab Emirates, a major oil and gas producer, and chaired by Sultan Al Jaber, who is head of the UAE national oil company, Adnoc. The company is planning a large expansion of its production capacity, and last year it sent scores of executives to the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt. Al Jaber attended the Bonn talks for two days last week and spoke only briefly in public. He said: “The phase-down of fossil fuels is inevitable. The speed at which this happens depends on how quickly we can phase up zero-carbon alternatives, while ensuring energy security, accessibility and affordability.” He failed to give an assurance that a phase-out of fossil fuels would be on the official agenda at Cop28, despite a concerted push by many developed and developing countries for its inclusion. The UAE Cop28 presidency has insisted it is up to all the countries represented at the talks to make decisions on the agenda. Progress was slow at the Bonn talks, where countries had been hoping to clear away minor technical issues so heads of government could come to Cop28 to make the bold political decisions needed to put the world on track to meet the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Officials could not even agree an agenda for these preliminary talks. For most of the fortnight, the adoption of an official plan for the Bonn talks was delayed by an impasse between developing countries, which are frustrated that promised financial assistance has not been forthcoming, and rich nations that wanted the focus to be on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Harjeet Singh, the head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, put the blame squarely on rich governments. “The Bonn climate conference laid bare the glaring hypocrisy of wealthy nations, showcasing a remarkable indifference to the struggles of developing countries,” he said. “Let’s be clear: without honouring their financial pledges – directly tied to their historical role in driving the climate crisis – these affluent nations lack the moral authority to exert pressure on poorer countries. Developing nations face the monumental task of eradicating poverty, fostering green development, and coping with escalating climate disasters. They deserve unwavering support, not undue pressure.” Eventually, with only a day’s negotiations left, the impasse was resolved so that progress made during the talks could be officially recognised. Poor countries are hoping for further progress on climate finance from a conference expected to be attended by more than 50 world leaders in Paris next week, hosted by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Reform of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions will be on the agenda, and countries will be expected to come forward with new ideas on how to mobilise the trillions needed for developing countries to shift their economies to a low-carbon footing and prepare for the impacts of the climate crisis. Left unresolved at Bonn was the question of which country would host next year’s summit, Cop29. It is the turn of the eastern group, which comprises Russia and former eastern bloc countries in Europe and central Asia. Tensions over the Ukraine war have riven the group, and within eastern European countries there are rivalries and feuds. Bulgaria is one candidate, but a highly placed European source told the Guardian that the country’s delegation had failed to attend EU coordination meetings at Cop27. The controversy looks unlikely to be resolved soon, and a decision could be put off to the end of Cop28.'}, {'_id': '648c584d51ac33b515b4a6e1', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/15/wildcats-to-be-released-secret-scottish-sites-effort-avoid-extinction', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': 'test', 'title': 'Wildcats to be released in secret Scottish sites in effort to avoid extinction', 'lead': 'Animals to be introduced during next three years but ecologists say they still face survival challenges', 'author': 'Severin Carrell Scotland editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-15 16:47:09', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-16 14:40:45.114624', 'dateUpdated': 'test', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/1f98b1171cfbfd4416811edf4fe0301b8ebfd754/0_629_2615_1569/500.jpg', 'body': 'About 20 specially bred wildcats are being released at secret locations in the Scottish Highlands by conservationists hoping to save the species from extinction in the UK. The animals were raised in captivity at a wildlife park in the Cairngorms as part of a breeding programme run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, which is expected to release up to 60 cats into the wild over the next three years. It is the first time a predatory mammal such as the wildcat has been officially released in the UK, and if successful will increase calls for Eurasian lynx to be introduced in Scotland – more than 1,000 years after they were hunted to extinction. The captive breeding programme was set up after Scotland’s wildcat population was on the cusp of being declared genetically extinct in the wild in 2019 because of habitat loss and interbreeding with feral domestic cats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature said the wild population was “no longer viable”. It estimated as few as 30 were living in the wild in Scotland. “The number of wildcats is too small, the hybridisation too far advanced and the population too fragmented,” it said. Although the cats, which feed on mice, voles and rabbit, have been carefully acclimatised using animals raised in captivity in the Cairngorms, ecologists still worry they face major survival challenges. Local people including gamekeepers, who may fear wildcats could eat grouse and pheasant chicks, have been educated about wildcat living habits. The project has also heavily monitored feral and domestic cats in the release area, with 100 camera traps locating cats, which are then trapped and if necessary vaccinated and neutered to avoid hybridisation with wildcats. The wildcats have been released in the Cairngorms national park wearing satellite tracking collars so they can be carefully monitored and supervised. Dr Helen Senn, the project leader and head of science and conservation programmes for the RZSS, said that eventually wildcats raised or trapped on mainland Europe could be included in the release scheme. “We hope that this project will pave the way for the full recovery of Scotland’s last remaining native cat species,” she said. “Unfortunately, life is tough for wild carnivores and the sad reality is that some of the wildcats that we release will not survive due to threats such as road traffic. Their survival is contingent on their individual behaviour in a new environment. “However, we also know that inaction will result in extinction. As human activity is responsible for the wildcat’s decline, we have a responsibility to take action now to protect one of our rarest and most threatened mammals.” Francesca Osowska, the chief executive of NatureScot, the government conservation agency, said the project sat within a wider mosaic of species reintroduction and rewilding projects. “A huge amount of work has laid the ground for these wildcat releases, and we’re proud to have played our part in that. Our research shows that wildcats are facing extinction in Scotland, which makes conservation translocations like this a vital tool for the species’ recovery,” she said. “The newly released wildcats will face significant challenges as they seek to establish themselves, so it’s crucial we continue to do everything we can to give them the best chance to survive, and thrive, in Scotland.”'}, {'_id': '648a00ef51ac331cf1e7013b', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/14/bernie-krause-sound-ecologist-disappearing-world', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': [], 'title': 'The sound ecologist capturing a disappearing world: ‘70% of habitats I recorded are gone’', 'lead': 'Bernie Krause has been recording sounds from the natural world for 55 years.

The haunting song of humpback whales conjures the stillness of the deep sea, drowning out the noise of the science museum – and the world – outside. This is The Great Animal Orchestra, a sonic voyage through seven ecosystems composed by the pioneering soundscape ecologist Bernie Krause. After its 2016 premiere at the Fondation Cartier museum in Paris and subsequent tour through Europe and Asia, the immersive exhibit arrives on the west coast for the first time. “It’s about damn time,” said Krause, who’s called the San Francisco Bay Area his home since the late 1950s. Born in Detroit in 1938, Krause is best known for the musicality of his recordings of the natural world. For the last 55 years, he’s evoked the textures and contours of global habitats by layering hundreds of wildlife sounds into succinct tracts, or soundscapes. Soundscape Dzanga-Sangha re-creates an early morning in the Central African Republic rainforest – precisely 8 September 1994 – beginning with the ambient hum of insects buzzing in the dark. The volume erupts at dawn as the first light triggers a chorus of wailing bird calls and croaking hyraxes, whose frequencies appear on a graph, or spectrogram, illuminating the digital walls of the theater. The insects register in the midrange of 6,000 hertz, while the hyrax barely breaks 2,000. The day climaxes with the bellowing roar of elephants thrashing in a salty marsh, a frequency so loud and so low that it sends ripples through a shallow pool of water on the theater floor. “I wanted to give people a sense of the power of these animal narratives,” Krause said, not only to convey the beauty of these habitats, but to highlight the urgency of the climate crisis ravaging our wildlife. His personal library of more than 5,000 hours of recordings holds snapshots of a rapidly deteriorating world. In Krause’s estimation, “Almost 70% of my archive comes from habitats that have disappeared.” Music of the natural world Soundscape ecology is a relatively new field that studies the acoustic relationships between living organisms. As a lifelong musician, Krause contributed to the field by thinking of natural sounds “in musical terms”, he said, as well as coining the word “biophony” to describe the collective living sounds of an ecosystem. Reading spectrograms as musical notation, he noticed that animal sounds each operated at their own distinct frequencies, like singing particular parts of a song. In the early 1980s, when he posited that healthy ecosystems’ sounds function as a highly structured organization, his ideas were dismissed; the scientific community was still recording animal sounds individually. “Guys mostly went on the field with parabolic dishes that separated birds and frogs and insects and mammals out of context, out of the acoustic fabric of the environment,” Krause said. Consequently, “they were never able to put Humpty Dumpty back together again in a way that actually sounded real.” Krause made his first field recording in 1968 in the Muir Woods north of San Francisco, just after signing a Warner Brothers record deal. A tremendously successful electronic musician at the time, he was collecting sounds for In a Wild Sanctuary, a 1970 album remembered as a groundbreaking experiment in combining instruments with wilderness recordings and synthesizers. He recalls his immersion into the forest as a life-changing experience, a relief from his windowless recording studio and gnawing ADHD. Simply put, he said, “I felt alive.” After writing the score of Apocalypse Now in 1979 made him enough money to leave the entertainment industry forever, Krause earned a PhD in bioacoustics and spent the next decades retreating alone into the field and simply listening, waiting patiently for the revelations to emerge. A grand epiphany struck him one night in Africa in 1983 as he started to hear the origins of human music in the rhythm and percussion of the natural world. “This is an orchestra,” he thought. “This is what enables us to dance and sing.” An urgent plea for the environment The Great Animal Orchestra is an audiovisual collaboration between Krause and United Visual Artists (UVA), which programmed the spectrograms to illustrate his findings for viewers who might not share his ear. “In a healthy habitat, a spectrogram displays a wide range of animal vocalizations,” Krause explained. These too offer a stark illustration of landscapes in flux. One unedited 1988 recording featured in the exhibition is from Lincoln Meadow, California, and shows a spectrogram dense with the bright, intricate song of finches, quails, sapsuckers and sparrows. In 1989, the orchestra sounds dimmer in comparison, but the difference is particularly stark on the spectrogram: the only visible frequencies belong to a single sapsucker and the flowing river. Between the two years, the meadow had looked exactly the same to Krause, but there lies the urgency of The Great Animal Orchestra: over the course of his career, he’s heard the disappearance of different species before any problems had become visible. As time has worn on, Krause said he’s felt little optimism in the progress against the climate crisis. Where in the 1960s, 10 hours in the field were enough to produce one hour of usable material, the time it takes today is now closer to 1,000 hours. In 2017, he and his wife, Katherine Krause, lost their home to deadly wildfires in Sonoma, California – a disaster of the type that experts say will happen more frequently and intensely as the planet warms. Krause has been something of an outsider for most of his career. “I had this huge library of materials that nobody else was interested in,” he said, releasing albums of his soundscapes through Wild Sanctuary, the environmental outreach organization he runs alongside Katherine. But shortly after he published his 2012 book, The Great Animal Orchestra, Fondation Cartier, a contemporary art museum launched by the French jeweler, approached him with a commission to create an immersive, audiovisual installation. The result is a poignant expression of the world’s interconnectedness through sound. According to Krause, “They had a vision for it that was much bigger than mine.” Krause maintains hope that his work can serve as a moving plea for the environment. “When I create works of art I’m able to reach people on an emotional level” – more than any research paper ever could, he said. “I don’t know that there isn’t some young kid out there who has the imagination and power of expression to convey to enough people that we have to make some changes. But it has to happen very fast.” The Great Animal Orchestra will run at the San Francisco Exploratorium until 15 October 2023'}, {'_id': '648a00ef51ac331cf1e7013f', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/14/southern-water-refuses-order-to-release-memos-about-sewage-discharges', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': [], 'title': 'Southern Water refuses order to release memos about sewage discharges', 'lead': 'Information commissioner had demanded that the water company publish 53 documents last year', 'author': 'Sandra Laville', 'datePublished': '2023-06-14T13:56:12Z', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-14 20:03:27.294216', 'dateUpdated': None, 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/63860d32a2c1cbc014c971262d6eac5b078a82e0/0_32_7997_4798/500.jpg', 'body': 'Southern Water is refusing demands by the information watchdog to publish internal communications between board members relating to discussions about raw sewage discharges. The company, which was fined £90m in 2021 for discharging billions of litres of raw sewage into protected coastal waters, was ordered to publish 53 documents by the information commissioner at the end of last year because of the “substantial and weighty public interest”. But the company said they contained “sensitive” internal decision-making processes on a live issue relating to sewage discharges, and has refused to release them. Seven months on from the information commissioner’s order to publish, Southern is taking the case to the first-tier tribunal to appeal against the ruling and to keep the documents secret. First reported in Private Eye, the 53 documents relate to discussion at board level in 2020 and 2021, including agendas and minutes of meetings of the board discussing sewage spills or storm overflows. Ofwat, the industry’s regulator, has promised to apply new scrutiny to the boardrooms of water companies. Southern has tried to cite exceptions under the environmental information request (EIR) rules to defend its decision not to release the documents. But the information commissioner has said the exceptions largely do not apply and there is a public interest in releasing the documents. The company argued that the documents should remain secret because of “the need to protect Southern Water’s internal processes of deliberation and decision-making and with regard to the sensitivity of the information and the circumstances surrounding the request”. The company said the request for the documents on sewage spills or overflows in 2020-2021 related to live issues and should not be published. But the commissioner said the public interest favoured disclosing the information, and said there was even greater public interest because the company had pleaded guilty in July 2021 to 51 individual offences of discharging sewage illegally. Evidence presented showed the company had presented a picture of compliance to regulators that was deliberately misleading. “Set against this backdrop, the commissioner considers that there is a substantial and weighty public interest in understanding what measures the public authority was taking, during the period covered by the request, to improve its performance and put measures in place to prevent a recurrence of the offences,” the information commissioner has said. Ed Acteson, of the campaign group SOS Whitstable, said: “Southern is repeatedly saying it is going to be more transparent but we are just not sure that is the case.” He said data on the company’s Beachbuoy app had recently been changed to make it more difficult for the public to see where raw sewage discharges were taking place or their impact. Last year Southern was accused of “environmental vandalism” after discharging raw sewage for more than 3,700 hours at 83 bathing water beaches during the first eight days of November alone. The information commissioner said the company operated a monopoly and if customers were dissatisfied with the way wastewater was being handled, they did not have the right to ask another company to handle it instead. “One of the few powers consumers do have, is to make use of the EIR to seek environmental information such as this and use that information to hold the public authority to account, the information commissioner said. Southern Water said as there was a court process under way it could not comment.'}, {'_id': '648a00ef51ac331cf1e7017f', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/14/retired-santos-gas-wells-off-western-australia-coast-leaking-for-a-decade-regulator-says', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': [], 'title': 'Retired Santos gas wells off Western Australia coast leaking for a decade, regulator says', 'lead': 'Energy giant proposes monitoring wells for five years, as government says seepage volumes are factored into emissions reduction targets', 'author': 'Lisa Cox', 'datePublished': '2023-06-14T08:11:33Z', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-14 20:03:27.294660', 'dateUpdated': None, 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/cecedab1f39245a583202b77dd22ecdc6dec7e2c/0_385_5000_3000/500.jpg', 'body': 'Decommissioned gas wells from a Santos project off the coast of Western Australia have been leaking from the seabed for a decade, according to documents published by the national petroleum regulator. The leaks, first reported by WA Today, are located at the Legendre gas field north of the Pilbara port of Dampier, and were detected by an underwater vehicle in 2013. In a report to the petroleum regulator, Nopsema, Santos wrote it was “not feasible” to stop the leaks, which are described on the regulator’s website as “ongoing gas seepage in the form of small bubbles”. The company has proposed monitoring the wells for five years under an environment plan. A Santos spokesperson said the company had engaged the national science agency, the CSIRO, to “undertake an in-depth monitoring program”. “Findings to date show that the gas is nontoxic and unlikely to present an environmental hazard,” they said. “Santos is currently implementing a management plan that includes a regular monitoring program.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup A Nopsema spokesperson said the regulator had asked Santos to “undertake activity to show the cause of the reported seepage and required that Santos submit an environment plan to demonstrate the appropriate management of any works undertaken”. The spokesperson said the regulator could not comment on the specifics of the environment plan while it was under assessment. Jeff Waters, an offshore fossil gas campaigner at the environment group Friends of the Earth, disagreed with Santos’s assessment the leaks were nontoxic. “Certainly it’s toxic to the environment in the sense that it’s adding to the greenhouse gas emissions of Australia,” he said. “My question to [climate and energy minister] Chris Bowen is ‘how many greenhouse gas initiatives are being cancelled out by rogue emissions from leaking wells and what’s the government going to do about it?’” A spokesperson for Bowen said estimates of greenhouse gas emissions from abandoned gas wells were reported in Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory and were taken into account against Australia’s emissions reduction targets. Nopsema has regulatory oversight of 873 wells. Of these, 457 are operational wells, while 326 are shut-in, suspended or temporarily abandoned wells. The remaining 90 have been plugged and abandoned and are awaiting final signoff from Nopsema that it is satisfied those works are complete. The Legendre project ceased production in 2011 and wells were decommissioned by the then-operator, Apache. Santos took over management of Legendre in 2018 and continued with this program and subsequent surveys, including the most recent surveys in 2022.'}, {'_id': '648a00ef51ac331cf1e70184', 'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/14/eus-biodiversity-law-under-threat-from-centre-right-meps', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'subCategories': [], 'title': 'EU’s biodiversity law under threat from centre-right MEPs ', 'lead': 'The EPP, the European parliament’s largest group, says it supports climate goals but objects to ‘bad proposal’', 'author': "Lisa O'Carroll in Strasbourg and Patrick Greenfield", 'datePublished': '2023-06-14T08:00:08Z', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-14 20:03:27.294687', 'dateUpdated': None, 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/f84bc96d9803e952109ffd62b4796ba9b0509571/0_369_3146_1888/500.jpg', 'body': 'EU plans to restore biodiversity on land and sea are hanging in the balance after the European parliament’s biggest political group called for the proposals to be torn up and rewritten. On the eve of a vote on the nature restoration law (NRL) package, the chairman of the centre-right European People’s party (EPP) said the vote was “50-50” with potential for others to join their opposition ranks on Thursday. On Wednesday evening the chair of the environment committee, Pascal Canfin, urged members to vote for the act accusing the EPP of “fake news” over food production. “Our food security depends on protecting nature from collapsing. Yet, the right and the far right are joining forces against the nature restoration law that we’re voting on Thursday. My answers to their fake news,” he said. The proposals are aimed at protecting all endangered ecosystems ranging from rivers and seas to peat bogs and indigenous forests by 2050 through legally binding targets. The UN environment chief Inger Andersen urged MEPs to show leadership for future generations ahead of the vote and deliver on the promises the union made at Cop15 just 6 months ago. She condemned those that had turned restoring biodiversity into a culture war issue. EPP chairman Manfred Weber said his group of MPs supported goals on climate change but said the NRL was “a bad proposal”, which would reduce food production on the continent. “The overwhelming majority of farmers don’t need any lesson about sustainability, they got their farms from previous generations so they know what sustainability means,” he said. Irish Green party MEP Ciarán Cuffe, who is stewarding parallel proposals on renovation of energy inefficient buildings through parliament, said he worried about a potential deeper EPP resistance on climate emergency measures. “I’m concerned that the EPP’s commitment to climate and biodiversity is lukewarm. We have been told they have a kill list of laws they don’t want to see passed. The climate and biodiversity crises have not gone away and if anything we need to step up efforts in the face of foreseen newspaper headlines about extreme temperatures and warming,” he said. While Weber claimed the proposals would harm Europe’s food production by sequestering land for rewilding and other projects, Cuffe said the 12-volume, 5,689-page impact assessment put the economic benefits of restoring nature at €180bn (£154bn) compared with the cost of the measures which have been put at €154bn. The World Wildlife Fund has also argued, along with the Greens, that increasing biodiversity including bees and other pollinators actually improves food production. German MEP Peter Liese, the environment spokesperson for the EPP, said on Wednesday the votes were now split 42:42 of the 84 strong committee with EPP representing 22 of those. “We have four undecided votes, it will be very tight,” he said. He said one of the main concerns is that the European commission has not set in stone of definition of “degraded” land or rivers. Under its present guise, it could require 25,000 kilometres of European rivers to be restored to wilderness, he said, impacting the development and existing hydro-electric plants. “The problem with the impact assessment report is that it was written before the outbreak of war,” said Liese. On Monday, CEOs from 50 companies including Ikea, Nestle and H&amp;M published an open letter voicing their support for the law, warning protecting nature was key to a well-functioning economy. Andersen, the executive director of the UN environment programme, told the Guardian it was critical that the EU delivered on the promises it had made to the world on nature. “Talk is easy. You have to follow through. I think if if the EU does not follow through with the targets that it has in the nature restoration law, it sends a detrimental signal to the global commitment to protect biodiversity and to the tears that we shared that night at 4am in Montreal. It would negate it all. “There’s a real to do item here: for those folks that sit in the EU parliament to do the right thing by the next generation,” she said. “How can nature become a culture wars issue? To me, it is absurd. Nature is what feeds us and sustains us. It’s everything.” Last month, EU environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius warned abandoning the law would send “a dangerous, negative signal to the world”. Alongside separate proposals to reduce pesticide use and climate laws, the NRL is part of the European Green Deal. Weber told reporters in Strasbourg: “We will not achieve our climate change goals, our goals on biodiversity [if we go] against the rural areas,” he said. Under the proposals, 88 MEPs on the committee leading the passage of the act, will be asked to vote on a version of the European Commission’s proposed laws which has been slightly watered down to try to secure the agreement of the European parliament. They will be asked to support measures to “put in place, without delay, effective and area-based restoration measures which shall collectively cover, by 2030, at least 30% of the union’s land, freshwater and sea areas in need of restoration”. But Weber indicated his group would not be budging. “We have a lot of concerns which cannot be fixed with this concrete proposal. That’s why we asked for a restart, for a new proposal from the European Commission.” The EPP has already walked out of negotiations on the NRL and is hoping others will join them in opposition to the legislation during the vote on Thursday.'}, {'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/13/turkmenistan-moves-towards-plugging-massive-methane-leaks', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'title': 'Turkmenistan moves towards plugging massive methane leaks', 'lead': 'Central Asian country has the worst rate of climate-heating ‘super-emitter’ events in the world', 'author': 'Damian Carrington Environment editor', 'datePublished': '2023-06-13T10:55:32Z', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-13 14:19:27.079883', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/d717c24774c309be869c025af6bf982e7af133ab/0_0_3264_1958/500.jpg', 'body': 'The president of Turkmenistan has launched two initiatives aimed at cutting the colossal leaks of methane from the country’s oil and gas industry. Success would represent a major achievement in tackling the climate crisis. A roadmap will pave the way towards the central Asian country joining 150 others that have already signed the Global Methane Pledge to cut global methane emissions by 30% by 2030. An inter-departmental government commission will also focus on reducing emissions of the powerful greenhouse gas. Methane emissions cause 25% of global heating today. A surge since 2007 may be the biggest threat to keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5C and seriously risks triggering catastrophic climate tipping points, according to scientists. Tackling leaks from fossil fuel sites is the fastest, simplest and cheapest way to slash methane emissions. Turkmenistan was responsible for the highest number of methane “super-emitter” events in the world in 2022, the Guardian revealed in March. The worst leak caused climate pollution equivalent to the rate of emissions from 67m cars. The US and Russia also had a large number of super-emitter events. “It is very encouraging that a global effort is under way to assist Turkmenistan to mitigate its methane emissions, and that local authorities are responsive,” said Manfredi Caltagirone, head of the UN’s International Methane Emissions Observatory (Imeo). “But after the announcements, the real work starts to actually cut emissions,” he said. “Operators in Turkmenistan need to perform measurements on each of their assets, report transparently and mitigate effectively.” Caltagirone said Imeo and the UN office in Turkmenistan were ready to step up their support. President Serdar Berdimuhamedov approved the methane roadmap for 2023-2024 during a cabinet meeting on 10 June. Measures include improving national legislation, cooperation with foreign partners to set up pilot projects and collaboration with Imeo. Berdimuhamedov stressed that Turkmenistan would continue to contribute in every possible way to regional and global environmental partnerships, according to reports. At the UN climate summit Cop26 in Glasgow in 2021, Berdimuhamedov said Turkmenistan was reducing greenhouse gas emissions “by introducing modern technologies in all spheres of the state’s economy”, with “special attention” to the reduction of methane emissions. Satellite data analysis for the Guardian showed little change in Turkmenistan’s methane emissions from 2019-2022. Scientists whose recent research focused on 29 super-emitter events between 2017 and 2020 said the more frequent emitters were already in “conflict with Turkmen law”. The decree authorising the interdepartmental commission on reducing methane emissions was signed by Berdimuhamedov on 2 June, a few days after he had spoken to John Kerry, the US special envoy for climate, about potential financial support and expertise. In May, the Guardian revealed that methane leaks alone from Turkmenistan’s two main fossil fuel fields caused more global heating in 2022 than the entire carbon emissions of the UK. Emissions of the gas were “mind-boggling” and an “infuriating” problem that should be easy to fix, experts said. Foreign investment may be crucial to ending the leaks. A recent comment article in Eurasia Review said the country’s government was “allergic to spending its own money on such undertakings” The leaks are believed to come from ageing and poorly maintained oil and gas pipelines and from the venting to the atmosphere of unwanted methane gas that is produced alongside oil. However, gathering information on the ground in the repressive and authoritarian state is very difficult.'}, {'url': 'https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/13/uk-innovators-get-43m-to-develop-space-based-solar-power', 'primaryCategory': 'environment', 'title': 'UK innovators get £4.3m to develop space-based solar power ', 'lead': 'Minister says technology to collect energy and beam it to Earth could help boost UK’s energy security', 'author': 'Linda Geddes Science correspondent', 'datePublished': '2023-06-12T23:01:32Z', 'dateScraped': '2023-06-13 14:19:27.080117', 'language': 'en-UK', 'outlet': 'GuardianInt', 'image': 'https://media.guim.co.uk/b4ece419401f7ad080eb43d3f3311499335cb39b/0_1026_5604_3363/500.jpg', 'body': 'UK universities and tech companies are to receive £4.3m in government funding to develop space-based solar power. The technology, which collects energy from the sun using satellite-mounted panels and beams it to Earth, had huge potential to boost the UK’s energy security, the UK’s energy security secretary, Grant Shapps, said. Although the idea of building commercial power stations in space may sound far-fetched, the space industry has long been at the forefront of solar power development. Indeed, the need to power satellites was a key driver in increasing the efficiency of solar panels that generate electricity for homes and businesses, said Dr Mamatha Maheshwarappa, the payload systems lead at the UK Space Agency. Among the recipients of the funding from the government’s space-based solar power innovation competition are Cambridge University, which is developing ultra-lightweight solar panels that can withstand the high radiation levels encountered in space, and Queen Mary University of London, which is developing a wireless system to allow space-harvested solar power to be safely beamed to Earth. This month, scientists at the California Institute of Technology in the US claimed to have successfully transmitted solar power to Earth from space for the first time, using a prototype spacecraft called Maple that was launched into orbit in January. It uses an array of flexible lightweight transmitters to convert electricity into microwaves before beaming them to a specific location on Earth – in this case, a receiver on the roof of a building on Caltech’s campus in Pasadena – where they are converted back into electrical energy. Assuming that the technology can be made to work on a large scale, there would be some significant advantages to space-based solar farms. Because there is no atmosphere in space, the sun’s light is undiluted, meaning each panel would be able to generate more energy compared with an equivalent panel on Earth. The solar energy would also be more predictable and continuous due to the absence of day-night cycles, cloud cover and seasonal variations in sunlight. A UK government-commissioned independent study in 2021 found that space-based solar power could generate up to 10GW of electricity a year – a quarter of the UK’s power needs – by 2050. The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has claimed it could create a multibillion-pound industry and up to 143,000 jobs across the country. Announcing the funding at London Tech Week, Shapps said: “We’re taking a giant leap by backing the development of this exciting technology and putting the UK at the forefront of this rapidly emerging industry as it prepares for launch. By winning this new space race, we can transform the way we power our nation and provide cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy for generations to come.” Other projects to be awarded funding are: Satellite Applications Catapult Ltd in Didcot, for an experiment to test the electronic steering and beam quality of its space satellite antenna technology; MicroLink Devices UK Ltd in Port Talbot, to develop the next generation of lightweight, flexible solar panels; and the University of Bristol, to produce a simulation of solar space wireless power transfer capability and provide further evidence on the performance, safety and reliability of space-based solar. Imperial College London and EDF Energy will also receive funding for studies to assess how electricity from space-based power stations could be integrated into the electricity grid alongside other low-carbon energy sources.'}]
