It is an unrivalled cash cow, but it's also had an enormous impact on culture. Rockstar has made a habit of pushing video games in general forwards, whether narratively, technically or conceptually; GTA 3, 4 and 5 all did things that felt impossible on the console hardware of their time, with their ever-expanding cities and casts and creative opportunities for mayhem.

The Walkman made portable, individual music a possibility and became a great vehicle for the mixtape. And the Tascam Portastudio – an affordable recorder that allowed musicians to mix down four tracks to cassette – opened up home recording (Bruce Springsteen released his Portastudio demos as the Nebraska album, after deciding full studio versions of the same songs with the E Street Band couldn't capture the mood he desired)."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The format's spread was also dependent on an act of both generosity and commercial pragmatism by its maker.

The usual run is about 50 copies, and breaking even is 'punk gold, right there'. That's a lot easier when your main outlay is blank tapes, rather than pressing vinyl. At the moment, Aguilar says, he's paying about $1.16 (92p) per blank tape, and 50 cents for a case. Vinyl, by contrast, is likely to have a minimum run of 100 units and to cost much more. The Musicol Recording Studio in Columbus, Ohio, for example, quotes $1,345 (£1,079) for 100 12in records in plain white paper sleeves. And with cassettes, Aguilar doesn't have to join the long queue for vinyl pressing plants (currently six months at Musicol) – he can go from getting the recording from the band to having a cassette ready to sell in a fortnight, then sell them for between $4 (£3.20) and $8 (£6.40) apiece."}, {"type": "text", "text": "They look cool.

That same year, 2014, a mixtape also featured in the TV series Over the Garden Wall. 'When that and Guardians of the Galaxy happened a lot more people started popping up with tapes.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Stay Tough also has a Bandcamp page for downloads.

It is, however, so relatively little known outside Dublin that even the great Midlands-born and now Cork-based chef and food writer Darina Allen professed ignorance in her Complete Book of Irish Country Cooking."}, {"type": "text", "text": "She headed to the capital to find out more, a decision that perhaps offers a clue as to the dish's relative obscurity; rather than home-reared mutton and vegetables from the garden, in its usual form, coddle relies on cheaper processed meats, which places it, historically at least, in an urban rather than rural context. As McMahon very sensibly observes: 'with its associations of poverty, it is surprising to find 'authentic' recipes, especially given the status of the dish as being made with whatever leftovers were to hand (as in pig's trotters/feet, pork ribs, etc.' My mum, who has Irish heritage, claims no knowledge of the dish, let alone a family 'recipe', but, that said, here is my perfect version."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Trotters and ribs aside, all the coddles I try use sausages and bacon, though, in the course of further research, I hear rumours that white pudding can be deployed as a thickener (something I'm very pro, as a fully paid-up fan of puddings of any hue). That those sausages should be plain pork is about the only point of agreement, however. Some, such as Donal Skehan and Diana Henry, leave them whole, while others, for instance Allen, cut them into pieces, so they end up more like little meatballs. I come to the conclusion that, unless you're dealing with leftover cooked sausages in the traditional fashion, it makes more sense to keep them whole, not least so they remain as juicy as possible."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Unfortunately, it cannot be denied that a whole poached sausage is an unappetising-looking thing, and invites the kind of unsavoury comparisons that have no place in a family newspaper. It is, presumably, for this reason that Skehan begs for purist forgiveness before he browns them in a frying pan: 'I'm sorry, I can't bear a nude sausage sitting in my coddle.' In fact, almost everyone follows suit, with the exception of Allen and food writer Joan Scales, who boldly proclaims her granny's recipe the one true coddle, but really there's no good reason to do so, apart from aesthetic purposes. Sausage casings are flavourless, so browning them won't bring anything to the party other than making them look less like something recently pulled from the river. If you're squeamish, by all means give your bangers a quick sizzle in the pan first, but I'd advise simply chucking them in raw and remembering that a lot of delicious things in life aren't lookers."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bacon is a different story – all right-thinking people agree that golden-brown bacon fat is far superior to the pallid, poached stuff.

The lean, wafer-thin stuff beloved of our big retailers may be optimal for a crisp breakfast bap, but it dries out during prolonged cooking. Given how oddly hard it is to find thick-cut rashers with a decent amount of fat, outside a few decent butchers, you must use your own judgment as to the best option available to you."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The predominant characteristic of a coddle should be pork, rather than smoke, but if you prefer (or can only find) smoked bacon, the sky won't fall in. Similarly, I favour back over streaky, so there's more meat involved, but if it's all brutally trimmed and near translucent, streaky will stand up better to 45 minutes on the hob. (Maureen Butler of Meath, whose recipe is included in the Irish Countrywoman's Association's Irish Country Cooking collection, calls for a single piece of bacon that she then chops into 2½cm chunks after grilling, which happens to be about the size of the stuff sold as lardons in many supermarkets, and makes them a good alternative if you're struggling to source decent bacon.)

Yet such is the shame of this that only onions and potatoes feature in the written record."}, {"type": "text", "text": "You could, as Scales does, incorporate both raw, but frying the onions first will bring out their flavour, and especially if you do so in bacon fat.

Similarly, the potatoes work better, to my mind, if you leave them in fairly large chunks, rather than chopping them into small cubes, as in Allen's rather elegant take in the Irish Examiner. But my favourite approach is Butler's, who uses the potatoes as the top layer of her casserole, so that, while their bottoms are soaked in gravy, the tops taste purely of delicious, starchy spud."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Oddly, only two recipes touch on the variety required. Scales is firm that 'waxy are better than floury', and Skehan agrees. I like them to keep their shape, so I'm also going to recommend using waxy – often sold as salad or new potatoes – but of course all-purpose or starchier tubers will work just fine, too, and you might actually prefer the way they break down around the edges to thicken the gravy."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Skehan is also out on a limb with his addition of pearl barley, though it seems entirely in the thrifty spirit of the dish, and is particularly popular for those among my testers who aren't too keen on what they describe as 'wet food'.

Two good alternatives for you; Henry suggests using cider in her classic, and recently reissued Roast Figs, Sugar Snow (apples are reliably lovely with pork and onions); while Allen adds double cream, conceding that her take 'is more like a French blanquette, a rich and elegant, cream-based stew'. While undeniably tasty, it is very rich indeed. If the idea of a dairy-based coddle appeals, but the cream does not, a slightly plainer take is possible, as in Scales' recipe, which is finished with a pint of whole milk.

As I am the only person in the world not to like this apparently inoffensive herb, I cannot be trusted to be objective on this point, so I will simply say that you could (AKA should) swap it for Scales and Allen's thyme, because thyme is much nicer. Madden and Skehan's bay leaf is, I think, optional, unless you're making a creamy coddle: the flavour is particularly noticeable in Allen's dish.

In the early years of this period, feminism was seen as all but redundant. The 1990s had heralded a new raunch culture where women were cajoled into participating in their own sexualisation; not to join in would risk being seen as puritanical. Meanwhile, access to mobile phones, online messaging platforms and blogging sites led to a new generation of content creators, typified by Perez Hilton and Gawker (with its regular feature Gawker Stalker, which tracked sightings of famous people in real time), all building brands around tawdry celebrity gossip.

By accepting the commodification of her private life, her relationships, even her body … Kim was the one who made it.'

New (to me) discoveries included the Italian ristretto, meaning 'short shot', a more highly concentrated espresso, and the mirra, a bitter serve made from very finely ground beans – its name, in fact, derives from the Arabic 'mur', meaning bitter. Meanwhile, my wife ditched her usual flat white for a kleiner brauner (an Austrian coffee with a single espresso and a dash of warm milk), and would laugh that the image of Vienna, which showed on the touchscreen while her coffee brewed, transported her back to her visit to the opera there with her mum a few months earlier."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Siemens believes that when it comes to coffee, one size doesn't fit all, so the EQ900's customisation options are extensive.

Not only that, but the double spout can make two cups of coffee, of two different styles, at one time (which kind of feels like the machine equivalent of rubbing your tummy while tapping your head).

As gambling ads and betting platforms proliferate, and the slicing of individual matches into bettable segments grows ever finer, it seems inevitable that more players will succumb to the lures that snared Tonali and Toney. To feign surprise at the presence of wagering athletes amid a sporting culture built on gambling seems every bit as disingenuous as the police captain in Casablanca claiming to be 'shocked, shocked' at the bets being placed in Rick's Café Américain while quietly pocketing his winnings from the croupier. A rotten culture breeds rotten habits.

This has become a major quandary not only in soccer but in many other sports as well. Since the US supreme court struck down the federal law banning state-authorized sports gambling in 2018, pro leagues across America have been scrambling to figure out how to regulate betting by their contracted athletes. Wagering on sport is now legal in more then 30 US states. Many of the major professional teams have sportsbooks in or near their stadiums, and for many fans – whether watching live or at home – it's become a regular part of the gameday experience to place prop bets on games via mobile apps while the action is unfolding.

After a 2021 rule change, college athletes – previously held to a strict code of amateurship and prevented from earning money – are now permitted to profit from their personal brand. But sports gambling remains a powerful temptation, and the NCAA recently revised its betting regulations to counter the rising threat. Reinstatement policies for college athletes who breach gambling regulations have been made more lenient to take account of 'mitigating factors' for 'young people who have made mistakes,' according to a member of the NCAA's legislative committee – a necessary adjustment in a society where sports betting is now 'easily accessible nationwide with online platforms.' The NCAA, in calling for sympathy in the treatment of offenders, has recognized the difficulty of insulating players from the casino culture that surrounds them.

This hypocrisy is especially glaring in the case of English and European football, which has none of the structural egalitarianism (drafts, salary caps, strong player unions, and a tradition of central wage bargaining) that ensures a fairly even level of competition across American pro sports. According to the commission that ruled on Ivan Toney's case, the prohibition on sports betting in English soccer 'is necessary to protect the integrity of the game and to maintain public confidence in football.'

What kind of integrity can the Premier League seriously claim to have when the champions of England and Europe are under investigation for 115 financial breaches, and that investigation, announced amid much fanfare earlier this year, has in recent months gone eerily quiet? In the year of our lord 2023, when the billions of the Abu Dhabi United Group have turned the Premier League into a procession, each weekend brings a fresh managerial aneurysm, referees go easy on their own mates, and VAR remains a comic masterpiece of 'well done boys, good process' proportions, it seems laughable to think that 'public confidence in football' is a concept that remains intact, much less one that can be held together by the FA coming down like a ten-ton truck on Toney for lumping on himself to score against Burnley away. Yet here we are."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Recent reforms to the Premier League's match-day rules represent a timid step in the right direction: from 2026, front-of-shirt sponsorship deals with gambling companies will be banned. But advertising for gambling companies will still be allowed on pitchside hoardings and players' shirt sleeves, a compromise that the leader of anti-gambling movement The Big Step has correctly described as 'totally incoherent.' Thirty four clubs have signed on to The Big Step, which is campaigning to end all gambling advertising and sponsorship in English football, though most are lower-league or non-league. The only Premier League side to have endorsed the initiative is Luton Town, which is not surprising when you consider the strength of the stake supporters have in that club's identity and management; the other 19 clubs in the top flight have remained breezily indifferent. Hopes that The Regulator – a mythic figure of theoretically unimpeachable moral fiber much longed for among British football fans and apparently now finally on the brink of materializing – may be able to straighten out the many inconsistencies of English soccer's approach to gambling seem forlorn at best. Regulatory tweaks won't abolish the profit motive, and it's the lust for profit amid a global competition for viewers that will keep English clubs, like the Premier League itself, in thrall to gaming interests. The deals are simply too good to say no to. The rizz is too strong."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The singling out of individual player-gamblers for punishment, while justified, is really about keeping our eyes off the bigger fix.

Toney and Tonali are the scapegoats of a broken system. The whole spectacle of player punishment in soccer today has become a way to enforce a form of selective justice that distracts from other, more consequential infractions that go unpunished, the very unevenness of the sport's playing field.

He's tried, he says, to keep his focus on that task, instead of on his mounting success and, quite frankly, surreal life path thus far. 'I stay very present,' he said. 'One of these days I'll sit down and reflect more [on my career] and probably appreciate it– not that I don't appreciate it now, but appreciate it a lot more, and in a different aspect.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Partially due to the Lakers' dire bench situation in Reaves' rookie year, he saw playing time pretty quickly in Los Angeles, although it took a little while for him to become a regular rotation player, and even longer still to get elevated to the starting role he won deep into last season. As Reaves' profile began to climb, he became a fan favorite, especially as his stellar play in the second half of the year helped buoy the Lakers to a playoff bid. By the end of the season the ardor reached such a fever pitch that he was regularly garnering 'M-V-P!' chants during his trips to the free throw line."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Of course, there's the other side of the coin: the more people you have rooting for you, the more people you have doing the opposite.

'But all the outside noise is like … if you support me, great. If you don't, then it doesn't really matter to me. It comes along with it and I think that's the beautiful thing about sports, is that you're fans of who you're fans of.' He pauses. 'And that's pretty much it. I'm a fairly simple person.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Reaves was recently moved to a sixth-man role in the Lakers' rotation, a shift head coach Darvin Ham said was 'not a demotion, just a realignment', comparing it to Manu Ginóbili's super-sub function in the San Antonio Spurs' second unit. Reaves, to his credit, seems to have adjusted well. He has maintained his minutes load and remained impactful for the club; his points, rebounds and assists per game averages are all up from last season. 'Basketball is basketball for me,' he told a reporter after the Lakers' besting of the Portland Trail Blazers on Sunday. 'Start, come off the bench, go play pickup back home. I try to play the same way regardless of the situation.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I asked the Orlando Magic's Paolo Banchero, who played alongside Reaves at this summer's World Cup, what he finds unique about him. 'His fearlessness,' last year's No 1 overall draft pick said, without hesitation. 'He's not scared of any moment, really.' Banchero had, overall, a glowing review of his Team USA teammate ('great guy, super humble'), and was decisive in his view of where Reaves' career can go from here. 'I think he's on his way to being a star,' Banchero said. 'He's an every-game type of guy, he's going to show up in the big moments. I'm sure he's going to hit a lot of big shots for the Lakers. I think he's going to have a great career.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "It's not just Banchero, though, who has faith in Reaves. The Lakers' elder statesman himself, LeBron James, has articulated his confidence in him. In their locker room in Los Angeles, James tells Reaves: 'You're a star, man.'

So that really grated and I got really depressed about it'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Thompson's focus turned to writing her own compositions.

One of these issues was how young Black men were being disproportionately targeted by the police – 'because my brothers and their friends were being stopped and searched every minute. So I wrote a piece about stop and search, which was unheard of. When my tutor heard it, he was shocked.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "After graduating, Thompson seemed to be on the road to success. She was featured on the BBC show Ebony (1982-1990), which focused on Britain's Black community, and in the Radio Times in 1985, and had her own string quartet. Her composition for the detective series South of the Border, which aired between 1988 and 1990, was selected as a Top 20 BBC TV Theme in 1990.

I certainly did not fit into their box.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Shut out of the classical music world, Thompson pursued a career in television, working full-time as a researcher and director for about 15 years, freelancing across several production companies. During this time, she didn't stop composing, though. 'I was always writing but I wasn't getting the performances. Then I was approached by a promoter to set up an ensemble, and that was really the trigger,' she says. This included a range of singers, dancers, visual artists and instrumental soloists, and performed at London's Southbank Centre."}, {"type": "text", "text": "By the 2000s, the composing was beginning to pay off. She was commissioned to write a large-scale work to commemorate the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002: New Nation Rising, A 21st Century Symphony.

The symphony, which was later recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with almost 200 performers, including a rapper and dhol drummers, paid homage to the vast 1,000-year history of London. As well as being well-received at the time, New Nation Rising was reportedly an influence on Danny Boyle's celebrated opening ceremony for the 2012 London Olympics. Thompson believes that she received the royal commission because her compositions, which took inspiration from other musical genres such as hip-hop, were unique in comparison to the status quo. 'I was writing in a particular way, I wasn't doing all of that heavily discordant stuff.' But, she says, she remained an outsider within the classical music establishment.

So I think the basic principle, equality before the law, Lincoln had come to approve that during the civil war. He didn't really hold that view before the civil war.

And the way they guaranteed it was to allow Black men to vote. New governments were set up, biracial governments. For the first time in American history, Black and white men were sitting in legislatures, voting on laws, holding public office. This was a radical change in American democracy.

That would mean people who served in the military or held some kind of public office. Even a postmaster has to take an oath to the constitution. The purpose was to eliminate the old ruling class of the south from public office.

Not likely, but she's a well-known figure in politics. Well, she couldn't serve because she's under 35. And a court or somebody would just have to say, 'I'm sorry, you don't meet the qualifications here.' I am not a law professor. Neither I nor anyone else knows what the courts would decide.

But that's not the case. You can let people off from one punishment, but it didn't say this section is no longer applicable.

There have been only a handful of cases. There's almost no jurisprudence related to it, which is one of the reasons Congress has been reluctant to enforce it. Joe Biden has said he doesn't really want to get into this. It would guarantee a prolonged legal battle if you tried to enforce section 3 against Trump. Enforcing it against the county commissioner in New Mexico probably didn't raise a lot of animosity. But it has happened.

But not the president."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This has never been exactly determined, but it certainly seems the normal understanding of the term 'officer' is someone holding office. The president certainly holds office. When the constitution was ratified, there was no president. The previous constitution, the Articles of Confederation, didn't have a president. There was no executive officer. It was only the Congress. So it's unclear. They added the president as someone who could execute the laws. But I don't see how you can eliminate the president or exclude the president from this language.

I love that. In other words, even in their homes, people are debating the issues around the 14th amendment. There is no one single intent that you can locate in that gigantic discussion about constitutional issues, which accompanied the ratification of the 14th amendment.

(Briefly: if Trump paid hush money to Stormy Daniels via his fixer, Michael Cohen, then lied about it, the DA's office will try to contend that this constitutes not only a misdemeanour crime of cover-up, but a more serious felony entailing 'intent to defraud' in the interests of furthering Trump's election prospects.

In this troubled landscape, climate emergency and political collapse are recognisable but ramped up – surveillance is almost universal here, and many species including the jaguar have disappeared.

The result of this great collation is a bird's eye view, where the bird is a sharp-eyed falcon and the view something like looking down on Glastonbury festival.

An international crisis (over Soviet missiles in Cuba) threatens open conflict with Moscow, and a government minister, ex-Bullingdon Club, is caught lying to parliament (John Profumo). Plus ça change, you might think, reading all this, but Kynaston's editorial touch is light, and he doesn't dwell on the modern parallels.

By the early 60s, this group was being lampooned as 'the establishment', not least by the BBC's That Was the Week That Was, first broadcast in November 1962, and fronted by a 23-year-old ex-grammar school boy from Kent, David Frost.

In 1963, the Bristol Omnibus Company refused to employ black crews, and the Transport and General Workers' Union tacitly connived with these kinds of tactics.

He is neither an anti-European ideologue, nor a careerist populist who has to sell his every move to the tabloids at home. Not holding deep convictions leaves Cameron open to the charge of opportunism, but it means he can adapt to a drastically changed geopolitical landscape.

But above all, there's a deliciously insinuating portrayal of the doomed emperor from Joaquin Phoenix, whose derisive face suits the framing of a bicorne hat and jaunty tricolour cockade. Phoenix plays Napoleon as a military genius and lounge lizard peacock who is incidentally no slouch on horseback.

But for Phoenix he is the arch satirist and grinning mastermind, the outsider, the brilliant observer and exploiter of other people's weaknesses, the proto-capitalist entrepreneur, grabbing power, boosting confidence, bolstering the printed paper money. Later people might be nicknamed the Napoleon of Crime, but Phoenix's Napoleon is already that."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Scott stages a thrilling action set piece for Napoleon's first great achievement as a young artilleryman: the audacious attack on the British at Toulon in 1793, which cemented his reputation as a strategic master and a hater of the English.

There's also a fair bit of Commodus in Napoleon's auto-coronation scene as the new emperor who realises that the crown does not quite fit atop his Roman-style laurels. And with the help of his patron and friend Barras (Tahar Rahim), the young Napoleon rides the opposing stormfronts and triangulates the violent impulses of revolution and royalism and becomes himself the distillation of pure power, ruthlessly suppressing the mob with his 'whiff of grapeshot', which Scott shows us graphically."}, {"type": "text", "text": "As symbol and icon, Napoleon has always been seductive; since Tolstoy, the abandonment of Moscow and Napoleon's subsequent retreat have been symbolic of Mother Russia's miraculous deliverance, analogous to the resurrection itself.

For Kubrick in his famously abandoned film project, Napoleon might perhaps have been expected to bear the weight of all kinds of significance. But this isn't Ridley Scott's intent; he doesn't detain the audience with metaphysical meaning and certainly doesn't withhold the old-fashioned pleasures of spectacle and excitement.

Like many of her others characters – in The Virgin Suicides, Lost in Translation, Marie Antoinette – Priscilla is an ingenue.

There's no explanation of his military service in Germany, little sense of where he's at in his career or his music, no appearance by Colonel Tom Parker, his controlling manager hammily played by Tom Hanks in Baz Luhrmann's Elvis.
