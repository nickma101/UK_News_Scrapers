I already knew him for a romantic, his earliest influences William Blake and Samuel Palmer, all tree roots and bowered lanes. In this exhibition, however, it\u2019s the sybarite in Craxton that takes centre stage, his chest bare, his shoulders dusted with sand.

Having failed his army medical in 1941 \u2013 he had undiagnosed tuberculosis \u2013 his artistic education was roundabout. Peter Watson, the wealthy proprietor of Horizon magazine, took him up, installing him in a flat with Lucian Freud, and introducing him to Graham Sutherland, his mentor. Craxton and Freud got the dead animals they painted together from a Camden pet shop; a putrid donkey was hidden in the oven during a visit to their flat by Kenneth Clark. Sutherland, meanwhile, taught him that merely replicating nature was not enough; a \u201cnew reality\u201d required invention, too. But then, the times were kinder all round to artists \u2013 whether you had contacts or not. Craxton could live like a king for a week on a fiver, and usually survived on much less.

Head of Aged Cretan (1948) reveals the influence of Picasso, whom he had met in Paris two years before, but the jauntiness is all his own.
