Even if you're estranged, this remains true: you may not see them, but that doesn't mean you have no relationship with them.

We try all these useless tactics, like arriving home with a new baby and a Thomas the Tank Engine, which we pretend is from the new baby – when what we should do, says Anita Cleare, author of The Working Parents' Survival Guide, with a background in developmental psychology and social work, is 'stand in that child's shoes. There's no way of selling a baby to them as a positive. Babies monopolise the parents, they cry, you can't play with them.'

I think of the acres of time I just laid at my son's tiny feet, no plans, no bustling, arrangements cancelled on a dime because the thought of waking him up or even rearranging any of my limbs was intolerable.

'That's the conclusion I've come to after 15 years of writing an advice column. It all comes down to that. Children are quite powerless: they're not going to take their feelings out on the parents – they're going to take them out on the weakest member. I don't think parents are taught how much power they have, and how much is their responsibility.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Addis describes some other factors that might lead parents to favour one child: 'reproductive narcissism, the child that is in some ways the vision of our own unfulfilled hopes and wishes and dreams.

'One parent may try to harness one child; the other parent will try to get hold of the other,' Addis says. 'This is terribly upsetting for the children, but it also creates a projection of the parents' conflict.' It won't necessarily help if you split up, as separated parents are more than capable of expressing their disappointment and loss through the child that they perceive as most similar to their ex.

We can help them learn to do kind behaviour and take turns, but collaboration, negotiation, thinking about somebody else – those things take time.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "At any age, she says: 'The biggest trap parents fall into is directing too much attention to when children get it wrong rather than when they get it right. We fall into the habit of giving them attention when things are getting out of hand, and they tend to repeat the behaviour that gets them attention.' Children often say 'It's not fair' when what they actually mean is 'I didn't get the best out of that situation', but then sometimes it isn't fair, and sometimes you're tired and you can't remember how it started or what you promised or how it could be humanly possible to go to a swimming pool and not go to a swimming pool at the same time."}, {"type": "quote", "text": "'Don't get into the 'it's not fair' game,' Cleare says.

OK, so you both want to play with the same toy. Who's got an idea what you could do about that?

I mean, seriously."}, {"type": "text", "text": "There is evidence that same-sex siblings fare worse in adolescence. There's also evidence that the closer teens are in age, the more they'll fight. But Addis takes that with a pinch of salt: 'I used to work in a fertility clinic, and expectant parents would always be asking: 'When should I plan for the next one?' There's arguments for and against almost any age and stage. The second is always a threat to the first; the third is a threat to the second.' There tends to be less overt conflict with an age gap of more than two and a half years, which is when children start to separate from the parents, develop a theory of mind and an independent social world. But siblings with a smaller gap can be thick as thieves in adolescence, because there is more overlap in their friendship circles and development. For the record, my sister is two years older than me."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Why are some teenage siblings so horrible to each other? 'Teenagers are inherently alert to social threat,' Cleare says. 'The developmental stage they're going through is that they're hypersensitive to any social threat, exclusion, not being liked. That can come into play with two teens together.' Alternatively, it could be about identity: 'You're striving for significance as a teenager,' she continues, 'staking your claim to likes and dislikes and personhood. And sometimes you do that by being different from another person, and a sibling is a natural choice. 'I'm not like them – they must be rubbish.'' Again, what you don't want to do as a parent is get into the fray, because that just means three (or more) people fighting. 'This is about modelling. We speak kindly to each other as adults; we speak kindly to our children.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Once you are into adulthood, whatever your parents did or didn't do to make you feel equal, or empowered, or secure, or confident negotiating conflict, you have to sort things out for yourself. Or you don't, necessarily. It's not shameful for this relationship to fracture – it's just not easy, either. I was always fascinated by the rivalry (hatred) between the sister novelists AS Byatt and Margaret Drabble: Byatt, who died last week, was considered the more literary, Drabble the more readable. They were pretty open about their rift, to the point of constructing whole novels about having an awful sister. Byatt lost her son when he was 11, and they still didn't make up, not even close. I remember reading about that estrangement and thinking, whatever it is, nobody has walked into the sunset, whistling."}, {"type": "text", "text": "A huge amount of tension comes from the necessity of tolerating one another's different perspectives: it is incredibly difficult for siblings to accept that there isn't a single truth they all sign up to. 'Every sibling you speak to will have a different version of their upbringing,' Barbieri says, 'and they all need to be tolerated. The older sibling will think they're the holder of the truth, and they can tell the younger ones how it was. That can be really difficult, especially if one child was treated worse than the other.' This is part of the uniqueness of siblings, too: that there isn't any other relationship you'll ever have, however deep the love or friendship, where their diverting from your version of the past puts your credibility, your essence, at risk. You can't give it up: which of us would be prepared to say: 'Well, that's the furnace in which I think I was forged – but who knows, I might be wrong?' But you do also kind of have to give it up."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Addis also talks about what you could call the Succession conundrum: 'families where siblings are quite symbiotic, where there's a little bit too much investment in each other's lives. That can be because there's an insecure attachment to the parents, which is subtle or hasn't been aired, and the siblings will cling together a bit too much. But when a sibling relationship is working and working well, it's not symbiotic – it's adult-to-adult.

I have to admit that, until now, I'd kept an open mind on the subject. Dowsing, in the argument of the poem, encompasses some broader concept of divination, implied by the 'fathom-testing of the blind inner life'. The poet's 'one more twitch' is a little like a parent's, telling a child 'one more sweet', ie only one more.

The 'clear view' is found 'on high' – by cerebral bandwidth and foresight. But there's a literal ascent, too, allowing physical actuality and imagination to coalesce. Above the loch, we 'catch the flicker of a burn / reflecting emerald sky-foam // from Aurora Borealis'. A burn is a small stream, but the Scottish word also reminds us of a planet on fire. The miniature reflection of the 'emerald sky-foam' is magically realised, but, if we venture outside the poem, science warns us that the precipitation that produces the beautiful aurorae may also deplete Earth's ozone layer. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "From this verse on, environmental damage accumulates. Padel sums up the sad, complicated story of the collapse of the Gulf Stream's system of warm ocean-currents in the anthropomorphism of 'failing muscles'. The image gives animal form and activity to the water, and suggests how all animals, ourselves included, will suffer, and are suffering, as the ice caps melt and the sea levels rise. The next 'slide' in the visual presentation sweeps us into the core of the Chacaltaya glacier. Bolivia's only ski resort has already been destroyed: that big number which gives its age ('two-hundred-and-fifty- // million-year core') is tidily contrasted in the mimetic final stanza, tracing the glacier's final shrinkage to an area 'now shingle / and a fossil-feather-memory / of ice.' Again, the image of a living creature, one that could fly and, at least metaphorically, leave a 'fossil-feather memory' in the landscape which humans used and destroyed, adds an intimate dimension to vast geological process."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The whole poem is designed as a unity, the syntax and verses flowing into one another like the interrelated ecologies they reflect.

It sustains our visual pleasure; it has the verbal music and texture that irresistibly appeal to 'the blind inner life'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Importantly, many of the Watershed poems engage with the human psychology that's so frequently, and so foolishly, ignored at the present tumultuous 'watershed' moment. Padel uncovers the mirror, reveals the universality of climate denial. She allows us a small smile towards our inner Mrs Noah, who tries operatically to resist boarding the Ark, and has to be 'dragged up the gangplank / waving a goblet / shouting I will stay with my gossips.' (Rehearsing Noye's Fludde). On the other hand, there's the 'blast / of climate terror,' the sudden, equally incapacitating sensation 'as if a pub in that crystal cave at the end of the world / held a darts match for the blind / and the boards were our bodies … our hearts.'

Few of the poems are as painful as that image, but they all dramatise the loss we face."}, {"type": "text", "text": "I finished the collection recalling a comment by Penny Condry, the widow of the great naturalist writer, conservationist and ornithologist William Condry. In a conversation once, after a poetry reading, she remarked: 'Bill and I had a phrase we liked – the beauty of facts.' It wasn't intended as poetry criticism: the context was that of a friend's research project, but it impressed me because it related to the skills I hold in highest regard – the making of poetry, the writing of prose and the teaching of any worthwhile subject. Watershed is a reminder that to be taught, as a reader, by a writer who can communicate both the beauty and the facts is a joyous privilege … but also that, when the lesson is environmental, it has to lead to action."}]}, {"_id": "655b53e701c957ebd4e4d5b4", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/20/stopped-hiding-my-stammer-shame", "articleType": "text", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "subCategories": "None", "title": "I used to do anything to avoid talking to people.

This stemmed from the belief that telling others would make me vulnerable; I felt humiliated about not being able to get words out when put on the spot, and inferior to others who clearly coped better in such instances. A stammer can be a very isolating experience; it is, at its root, a sign of difference. Left untackled, it compels you to retreat from the outside world and to speak less.

The Israeli cabinet resolution 563, of 19 June 1967, determined that 'according to the international border, the Gaza Strip is located within the territory of the state of Israel'.

But Jordan decided to stop admitting them, so Israel increased its attempts to boost emigration of Palestinians to non-Arab countries such as Brazil and other South American states, as well as Canada and Australia, but with little success.

I also know, to a point, there's only so much you can do.' She remembers one young man in the morgue, who had been struck by lightning.

Does she think all these shows have given people a false sense of what forensic medicine can do? Or even how efficiently the police are using it? In the US, for instance, hundreds of thousands of samples, taken after sexual assaults, remain untested, known as the 'rape kit backlog'. Yes, she says, and so do her books. 'Scarpetta puts a rush on everything. In the real world, the DNA of what was left on that footprint, they get it four months later, if at all.

For a while, she was a donor and supporter of the Republican party. 'I'm certainly not right now,' she says. 'I don't know this Republican party, I don't recognise it.' She was a fan of, and friends with, George HW Bush even though there were elements of the party she thought were too conservative. 'But that was a cakewalk compared to what we're seeing today, which is bigotry and hatefulness. Banning books!

We have to be strong and stand up and be counted, make sure people know that you don't think that's OK.' How does she feel about the way women's reproductive rights have been rolled back in some states? 'Dreadful. What kind of world is this?' Does she worry about gay rights being next? 'Absolutely. When you start targeting one group, it doesn't end there. It never does.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Cornwell has always come across as a cool, tough action heroine.

Her work, she says, is what keeps her focused and on the right path. She is currently writing her 28th Scarpetta novel, going at life as relentlessly as she has always seemed to.

The women are kinder to each other, their rapport born of their desperation perhaps; you can imagine them grasping for one another in the dark.

It is a natural reaction to getting something stuck in the throat – a sudden-onset cough can often be from an obstruction you didn't notice on its way down – and it also expels mucus, microbes and foreign particles from the respiratory tract, protecting the lungs. In some cases, excess coughing can actually lead to … more coughing, as the nerve that controls this coughing reflex becomes hypersensitive, which is one reason that it's helpful to keep short-term coughs in check with hot honey water or sugar-free sweets."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Most short-term coughs are caused by colds or flu, although heartburn, allergies, or infections can all play a part. But again, unless you've had one that lasts, it is unlikely to be a signifier of anything serious. Technically, even smoker's cough can be a temporary issue, caused when the chemicals you inhale from smoking damage the small hairs – known as cilia – lining your airways, as well as causing inflammation and a buildup of mucus. Stop smoking, and it should improve – although other issues caused by lighting up won't."}, {"type": "text", "text": "One of the most common issues signified by a prolonged smoker's cough, for instance, is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the technical term for a whole group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties.

Smoking-related COPD won't go away if you give up tobacco – but at least it shouldn't worsen."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Another cause of COPD and other conditions, of course, is pollution: globally responsible for around one in six premature deaths worldwide in 2019, it's worsening in many areas of the UK even as the WHO lowers its recommendations for allowable legal limits.

Conditions such as lung cancer or pulmonary fibrosis aren't easy to treat, but they can be managed. 'I don't want people to worry unnecessarily, but there are times when it's important to push,' says Dr Gatheral. 'Most coughs will resolve on their own, but you know your own body, and if there's something seriously wrong then it's crucial that you get it checked out and, if possible, treated, sooner rather than later.' Coughing is mostly good for us, a biological adaptation that stops us from swallowing stuff or expels unpleasant material from our airways.

If Wilder were to fight and beat Ruiz Jr, Wilder would likely overtake the Mexican-American in the rankings."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Furthermore, rules are more flexible in exhibition fights.

In contrast, an exhibition fight could be set as six three-minute rounds, or eight two-minute rounds (these are random examples)."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Fights can of course end earlier if there is a knockout/TKO (technical knockout, where the referee or a ringside doctor halts the action, or a towel is thrown in), but such results are less frequent in exhibition bouts, where wins and losses do not count towards a fighter's record – and there is often no winner declared at all. For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions. While the 46-year-old has been somewhat aggressive in beating three of his exhibition opponents via TKO, two of his exhibition fights lasted the full number of rounds and no winner was declared."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Sometimes, however, fights that one would expect to be exhibition bouts are in fact professional contests.

The reigning champions of 2019 arrived among the favourites but saw their defence go down with a whimper after six defeats from their first seven games.

Crowd attendances and viewing figures picked up considerably at the business end but struggles on both fronts led to some genuine questions about the format's long-term survival. It is likely to be up for debate at the forthcoming ICC board meeting but anything dramatic at this point seems a long shot given the number of broadcast deals and staging agreements already in place. Keeping the product strong may be easier said than done, though, with a host of veteran stars exiting the stage and less prestige attached to 50-over cricket among the next generation."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The following edition has already been allocated to South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia and will take a different shape to the last two versions. It will be a relief to wave goodbye to the current structure, which allows only 10 teams to qualify and includes an inordinately elongated round-robin group stage. The stage will be opened up to 14 sides next time around, allowing for a more varied field, fresher match-ups and more underdog stories. But administrators remain bizarrely resistant to allowing a quarter-final stage – instead preferring the flabbier 'super six' phase. Two gripping semi-finals of entirely different styles, allied to the surprise result in the showpiece, should be enough to persuade decision-makers to push for more knockout matches."}, {"type": "text", "text": "On an individual level, Australia's Glenn Maxwell inked his name into the sport's folklore with his almost inconceivable 201 not out against Afghanistan.

Among bowlers, Mohammed Shami produced a World Cup record by scooping seven for 57 in the semi-final against New Zealand. On a wider context, Afghanistan had a solitary World Cup victory over three tournaments but added three more – including a jaw-dropping upset of England and an emotionally charged triumph over socio-political rivals Pakistan.

You'll note also that, so far, there is no news of old cane toad face giving any cash to, say, Help for Heroes. Which reminds me, even better than boycotting the show because of Farage's presence would be to make a donation to the brave, selfless volunteers who run the RNLI's boats, or 'taxi service for illegals' as Nigel likes to call the distinguished charity.

Because of Farage's medical exemptions, we might never witness the man himself sweating at 'breaking point' with fear. That, by the way, is what definitely would happen if he was told that a perfectly normal and decent Romanian family was moving next door to his home in Kent. That, surely, would be a reality ITV show worth watching.

But even though I felt grubby watching, and enjoying, something so patently tawdry, I was far from alone: with 1,650 million watched hours, it is Netflix's most successful series ever.

In the original show, contestants participate in a series of deadly reimaginings of childhood games. Red light, green light; marbles; honeycomb: all run the risk of killing you or carrying you closer to a jackpot of 45.6bn South Korean won (£28.2m). As social commentary goes, it was an incredibly heavy-handed critique of the country's issues with income inequality; as a sickly compulsive viewing experience, it was unparalleled."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It should be noted that the stakes in Squid Game: The Challenge are different – lower, you might say.

Each elimination adds $10,000 to a $4.56m (£3.66m) prize pool (said to be the largest in reality TV history). And that's enough to motivate the contestants. 'I don't come from old money,' one announces, 'I come from broke money.' Another states that people 'do a whole lot worse for a whole lot less', which is hard to argue with. For all that the ghost of its Korean cousin sticks in the mind, this is little more than a combination of The Traitors and Takeshi's Castle."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Battle royale reality games don't tend to have a particularly large field of contestants.

'I really thought I was going to make it all the way,' laments one eliminated contestant. Why?

In Squid Game: The Challenge, big personalities drop out at any moment, for the most luckless reasons. Don't get too attached to anyone, even those with seemingly established roles.

If people have an issue with it then that's something I have no control over. If they no longer like me, then what can I do? I need to live my happiness. I need to feel good.'

Do I look good enough to be in the position I'm in?' But I got over them by coming back to the music, because regardless of what your hair looks like, is the song any good? Are you being the best musician you can be?

'It was nice that people liked what I was doing, and it was fantastic to see more than three people coming to the shows,' she laughs. 'But that time was so intense – you take any opportunity because it could be the last one and you're operating at this really high energy, so by the end of those three years, I was exhausted. I felt I needed time to reconnect; I had been working so much that I forgot to check in with myself and get back to real life.' By real life, she means her family and her friends.

It's like you have a real sense of who you are and what you want to do and then you realise what it takes to become a singer. I went in with stars in my eyes, especially the way that first album took off, and every one of my dreams was suddenly coming true but it's a surreal experience, a happy one, but it's different.'

'Perhaps at the beginning, I thought I needed to transform into another character or become Emeli, whereas now I feel like I can be myself.'

But I feel like finally, musically, I'm coming back to that pace,' she says. 'I'm taking the time to listen to music again, songs I hadn't listened to since I was a child, and I'm spending more time at the piano.' Sandé is sanguine, enviably so.

We're taught that adage in a number of ways, not least in the litany of films that show crime, in all its splendour, not paying. But what about the inadvertent criminals?

Her unending disappointment, however, is interrupted one morning on a dog walk when she encounters Samuel (Paterson Joseph) and, together, they discover a boat full of cocaine – and dead bodies. Rather than turn the scene in to the police, they take the drugs to a lock-up and embark on a series of adventures that can only be described as shenanigans."}, {"type": "text", "text": "These involve running away from a psychopathic French kingpin known only as The Tailor (Tchéky Karyo), a bumbling PC (Ethan Lawrence) and his randy mother (Joanna Scanlon), plus an assortment of other underworld eccentrics. The tone is slippery – 'This is a story about a boat,' declares the wry narration of Ólafur Darri Ólafsson – existing somewhere between farce and thriller. Janet and Samuel are an odd-couple pairing – she is a down-on-her-luck charmer; he is a City slicker with a gambling problem – but one that is rooted in real lives and their real problems. 'We're not Thelma and Louise, you daft bastard!' Janet yells at her accidental partner when he gets carried away."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Haggard is a terrific presence as Janet, a woman always on the cusp of cynicism without ever quite arriving there. The sweetness of her central relationship with Samuel, though, is balanced out by violence that goes far further than most farces. Masked gunmen shoot up a police station, shotgun cartridges tear holes in the chests of half a dozen coppers, and a tongue is graphically extracted from the mouth of a squealing prisoner. For many, it will be enough violence to make them switch the channel. If Boat Story owes a debt of gratitude, then it is to cinema directors like the Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, and Martin McDonagh. Humour mixed with a blackness colour-matched from the darkest recesses of the universe."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The series is a strange match for BBC One, which usually peddles in far more emotional intimacy. Here, the characterisation is wafer-thin. Evil is rendered in cartoonish colours, while the less morally repugnant characters are uniformly motivated by desperation rather than avarice. Over a two-hour film – think Rian Johnson's The Brothers Bloom, Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, or Curtis Hanson's LA Confidential – this absence of psychological profundity is tolerable, but over six hour-long episodes, the relentlessly quippy, playful tone becomes grating. Meta comedy can be an effective tool – look at Arrested Development, or even Good Omens, which is a tonal sibling of Boat Story – but excesses of self-reference can be destructive. It's what killed The Simpsons. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "'We're not Thelma and Louise, you daft bastard!'

And it's good to see a show set in the north of England that isn't misery porn. Boat Story zips along like a Rube Goldberg machine, filled with twists and turns and unexpected revelations, rarely doubling back for any real introspection. Yet while it has many of the hallmarks of comedy, both in its generic conventions and in dialogue that is tricksy and droll, Boat Story is rarely funny. And that leaves it feeling, at times, like a knock-off of a Coen Brothers film rather than the real deal."}, {"type": "text", "text": "All the same, it's good to see a show as formally experimental as Boat Story getting a primetime slot.

Denial being the number one culprit. 'Obvious ones might be obsession, compulsion, capture of attentional focus and loss of control,' he says.

Unfortunately, what sounds like a simple question is laced with huge amounts of complexity."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Factors that will materially affect the answer include how old you are when you start saving, the level of your contribution, your investment returns, the age at which you decide to stop working and drawing on your pension, your life expectancy in retirement, your costs in retirement (for example, whether you still have a mortgage or rent to pay) and, crucially, what your definition of a 'good' standard of living in retirement looks like."}, {"type": "text", "text": "However, for most people, auto-enrolment at the minimum level will not deliver a comfortable retirement. To give you a rough idea, let's consider the 'retirement living standards' published each year by the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, an industry trade body.

If we assume contributions go up in line with inflation, inflation-adjusted returns are 4 per cent post-charges and they start contributing at age 22, this would imply a total contribution (inclusive of employer contribution and upfront tax relief) of £2,100 per year.

The rising costs of goods and services – inflation – is the main threat to preserving the value of our savings.

'With things being as hard as they are in hospitality, counterintuitively it's sort of the best time for something like this,' he says."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It was a leap of faith, but when a site in Stroud Green became free, Bailey snapped it up. Previously called Brave Sir Robin, Bailey reopened as The Robin Ale and Cider House in the autumn. The refurbished site is simple: green leather sofas, suede banquettes, a few paintings on the walls, and a small upright piano with a wooden bar at the back. It all comes from one of London's most respected landlords.  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bailey spent over six years at the Southampton Arms, a beloved Kentish Town boozer with a cult following, where punters converged for its wide range of ales and ciders and convivial atmosphere. 'That's where I learnt to run a pub,' Bailey tells me over a crisp, malty pale ale from the Burning Sky brewery in East Sussex. 'I'd done everything I could. The next logical step was to open my own place.' "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bailey is crazy about good beer. As the capital's watering holes increasingly serve the same generic beers — think Guinness and Madrí — at The Robin, there are six real ale and four hand-pulled cider lines, and never more than one lager. When the cellar engineers came to fit it, they were shocked at Bailey's request. But, as a free house, he can do what he wants. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "The beers, all from independent UK breweries and chosen by Bailey, constantly rotate, but there is always a range of styles, from IPA to bitter to porter. The Southampton Arms became famous among northerners thirsty for real ales, and football fans would often flock there when in London for an away match. Not far from the Emirates, the same could soon happen at the Robin, says Bailey, an Arsenal fan himself. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bailey's prime motivation, however, is creating a welcoming community meeting spot. 'Pubs are more than just pubs,' he explains. 'If you've ever been to the Southampton Arms, you know that. People depend on pubs more than many realise. Especially older, working-class men. That's where they go. Without that, where do they go to meet their friends? It's the one place where you're liable to meet a working-class person, an investment banker, all these disparate groups on equal terms.' "}, {"type": "text", "text": "A community atmosphere is well under way in Stroud Green. During our afternoon conversation, about five people stop to greet Bailey. When one local wants a pint, Bailey tells him to pour it himself. 'It's a very welcome addition, there's a nice little buzz going on,' a punter tells me. A few minutes later, another proposes to his girlfriend — at 4pm on a Wednesday. That he chose to do so here says it all. Bailey rushes off for a bottle of fizz and plays Just the Two of Us on the record player. On a return weeknight visit, it's busy but not overcrowded. Six weeks in, it's clearly a beloved local, Sunday evening music sessions always busy. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "What makes The Robin's success all the more remarkable is that pretty much all London's post-pandemic pub openings have been more gastro than pub. Think The Parakeet, The Baring and The Plimsoll, the latter just down the road. This month Tom Kerridge is set to open The Butcher's Tap in Chelsea, while the recently restored The Devonshire in Piccadilly features a full-blown restaurant upstairs. At The Robin you can get a salt beef sandwich, pork pie or pickled egg, and not much else. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "'It's tough, but we just want to be a good boozer,' says Bailey, who has plans for a more extensive menu to make use of the kitchen. There will absolutely be no cutlery on tables, Bailey insists, and definitely no reservations. 'If I opened the kitchen straight away, you'd get the foodies, and I didn't want anything to distract from the beer. If we had dinner plates, it just becomes self-contained, all a bit too civilised. Whereas at the moment people are just mixing and it's fine, they're having a drink, and the atmosphere is great.' "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Startlingly, most pints are priced between £4.74 and £5.22, at a time when £7 is becoming standard. 'I just take less money,' says Bailey. 'That's fine, I'm happy with that.' He shakes his head mentioning a nearby tied pub selling cask ale for £6.65. 'The truth of the matter is, pubs are struggling, and that's true. [But] I'm busy all the time, and we sell more beer. You can only charge so much for a pint.' "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Despite taking on a 15-year lease, Bailey describes himself not as a landlord but a 'custodian'. What does he mean? 'Pubs are more than pubs. It's a community asset and I'm temporarily in charge. I think people think, ‘I own [a pub]. So it's mine.' It's not really yours, you are serving the community. I'm a custodian because this was a pub before my time and if I do it well, it will be a pub after me.' Judging by its early success, it surely will be.
