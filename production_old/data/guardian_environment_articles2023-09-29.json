As early as the 1930s, microbiologists were puzzling over the disconnect between the microbial world they encountered in the wild and what they could study in the laboratory. They found that if they placed a sample \u2013 say a drop of seawater or smear of dirt \u2013 under a microscope, they could see hundreds of wondrous and varied organisms swirling about. But if they placed the same sample on to the gelatinous nutrient slurry of a petri dish, only a few distinct species would survive and grow.

The story of the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 is familiar: a fungal spore wafting through the corridors of St Mary\u2019s hospital and settling at random in Fleming\u2019s petri dish contained penicillin, which turned out to be one of the most potent medical weapons of the 20th century.

Waksman worked tirelessly to figure out the conditions required to grow these wild bacteria in his lab, and his efforts produced not just the second commercially available antibiotic, streptomycin, in 1946, but the next five antibiotics brought to market, too.
