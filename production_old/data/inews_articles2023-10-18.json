He could do nothing to stop the slide."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Until 2019, Yeovil’s problems were commonplace: too many people making too many bad decisions in search of right answers.

But with accusations of a lack of investment, deep concerns about a lack of transparency and communication and the eventual sale of Huish Park to South Somerset District Council, Yeovil lost their most valuable asset. Some supporters accused Priestnall of asset-stripping their club. One thing was sure: promotion was off the cards.

Eight years earlier, Woking were operating in a different world to Yeovil.

A year later, they were relegated to regionalised football thanks to a defeat at Wrexham. The Football League dream belonged to a Disney documentary now. Few talked about Yeovil."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Hope sprung eternal with the departure of Priestnall shortly after relegation to the sixth tier was confirmed.

Buying back Huish Park from the council would be an easy, if expensive, way to build trust. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "For now, trust is still lacking. Some supporters are understandably slightly reticent to emotionally invest in any individual – they have been burnt before. Mark Cooper, the manager during relegation and seen as Hellier’s man, is an explosive and divisive character.

At the start of the Premier League era, Yeovil had taken more Football League scalps than any other non-league club. In his podcast, Seb White tells the story of how that trophy and that club connected his family through football.

If we can harness that catchment area, revitalise the community feel and make the football club the pride of the county, I think there’s so much potential for the club to be a stable EFL club again.

As for the “inappropriate boss behaviour”: I need not point out that sometimes, in films, people are murdered, nor that Grant’s flirting in  is a deliberate object of humour and sexiness, nor that Bridget Jones specifically flirts with her boss, Daniel Cleaver (also played by Grant), by asking: “How dare you sexually harass me in this impertinent manner”.
