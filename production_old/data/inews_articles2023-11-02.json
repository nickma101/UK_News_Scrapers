Since they can pay up to 100 per cent of their earnings into a pension each year (up to the maximum of their annual allowance of £60,000), let’s assume they can afford to put £20,000 of the £55,000 lump sum into a pension at age 18.

Even if your grandchild is not working, they can contribute up to £3,600 a year into a pension with the government top-up."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In order to ensure any investment reaches its potential, we would encourage your grandchild to follow certain tried and tested practices. This includes using the tax wrappers we have highlighted, such as a pension or Isa to maximise tax-free growth, to have a diversified set of investments including stocks and bonds, and to stay invested for the duration rather than trying to time the market – as this column has raised before, there are enormous benefits to following these simple steps."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Lastly, when investing it’s also crucial to monitor how much you pay in fees to have your investments managed – small differences compounded over time can be transformational and in your grandchild’s case, they will have a multi-decade investment timeframe where lower fees will make a massive difference."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Time is a key factor in shaping your grandchild’s future.

This could, when laced with typical social media irony, encompass anything from childhood trauma to a haircut – the important point is that the “canon event” contributes to the impression of the person given to their followers on social media.
