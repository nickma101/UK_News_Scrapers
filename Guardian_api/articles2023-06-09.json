He beats him again next ball, at which point the camera cuts to the No3 Marnus Labuschagne snoozing in his pads. It worked for Sir Viv. Hold on, wake up Marnus! Warner has gone, edging Siraj low to Bharat. It was a slightly loose stroke, though he was probably unsettled by the quality of the preceding deliveries. Siraj certainly earned that wicket. 3rd over: Australia 2-0 (Khawaja 1, Warner 1) Australia are in no hurry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the match is only just at its halfway point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another quiet over from Shami. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Have Aus ever had two 36-year-old openers before?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wonders Gary Naylor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until Packer, once they hit 30, they usually had to go and work as a bank clerk in Moonee Ponds to pay the mortgage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I was going to say Test cricket has become an old-man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game until I remembered some of the sexagenarians still playing T20. As for the actual question, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to double check but I think the last time Australia had two openers aged 36 and over was at Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in 1926, when Herbie Collins and Warren Bardsley walked out to begin the first innings. The younger Jack Gregory (not to be confused with Jack Gregory the Younger) opened in place of Bardsley in the second innings. But like I say, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have to check. 2nd over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 1, Warner 0) Khawaja is turned round by a beauty from Mohammed Siraj, with the ball ending up in the hands of Bharat. India appeal desperately for caught behind, LBW and everything else, but the umpire isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interested and Rohit Sharma decides not to review. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the right decision: the ball pitched miles outside leg, may not have touched the bat and bounced short of Bharat anyway. Good ball though. 1st over: Australia 1-0 (Khawaja 1, Warner 0) Mohammed Shami starts round the wicket to Khawaja, with two slips and a gully. Shami\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record in England \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 40 wickets at 42 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a scandal given how well he has bowled for much of that time, particularly in 2018 when he almost broke the Expected Wickets algorithm. Khawaja flicks a single to off the mark, then Warner defends a couple of widish outswingers. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Usman Khawaja and David Warner walk out to bat with a liberating lead of 173. India aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t completely out of this, but they might need to bowl Australia out for 36 to have a realistic chance of victory. The innings break. That seems like a good time for a commentary handover. Please give a stirring round of applause to your friend and mine, Rob Smyth. History\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best with the bat, argues Andrew Brittain, is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153surely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Victor Trumper. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inventor of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdog shot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, that is so liberally applied in the short forms these days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If you asked me what a dog shot is, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think it was punching someone when they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking. Total dog shot, mate. Rahane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innings was the highlight of today. Really stood up when needed, handled the conditions well, and made the most of his slice of luck. But despite all the misses, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quality of bowling throughout was ominous for the weeks ahead. 69.4 overs: India 296-10 (Shami 10) Well, if India achieved one thing this morning, it was making sure there was no more follow-on chat. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re 173 runs behind, and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve at least assured that the Australians will have some thinking to do about how to go from here. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the coup de foie gras. Starc belts in a short ball, wicked pace on that watching from behind the arm, and Shami\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempted pull only gets a touch of glove. 69th over: India 294-9 (Shami 11, Siraj 0) Siraj is belted on the ankle by Green, given out, reviews it without any sense that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be reprieved, and then the tech finds a little inside edge. By that time half the Australians have left the field and have to come back. Even Siraj was trailing off towards the boundary line. Sighs of relief for the Australians, as finally their torment ends. Thakur has another huge wind-up and aims it all at a ball outside off stump. Hits about 2% of it. Into the keeper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gloves. 68th over: India 292-8 (Thakur 51, Shami 10) Spanked that! Straight drive, right past Cummins in his follow through, races away. Then he doubles down with a cover drive that is half stopped, but still goes all the way. 67th over: India 282-8 (Thakur 41, Shami 10) Innovation from Shami! The leading edge drive, to the off side of straight. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aiming that through midwicket and ends up with four on the far side of the bowler. Then gets an inside edge past his off stump and past Carey! Eight runs in two balls. Brendon McCullum must be involved in this, surely. Boland shifts his square leg behind the line. Shami whips the ball in front of square! Makes that man run all the way around to keep the scoring to two. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suddenly in double figs and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a productive over for India. Deficit down to 187. 66th over: India 271-8 (Thakur 40, Shami 0) Mohammed Shami comes out to bat. If Umesh is your No9, honestly, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a bit of strife. Cummins a little short at Thakur, who deflects a run to deep square. Wonder if that was deliberate from the bowler to turn over the strike. Five balls at Umesh to come. Leg slip comes in, two regular slips and Green in the wingspan zone. Cummins rips one past the edge, top drawer. Then Umesh gets four! Not textbook. Jumps in the air, and while mid-air reaches outside off stump, jabbing the bat at a wide line, edging it between gully and point. Hit a six, champ. No sixes coming. Because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bowled. Standard Cummins: on line, hard length, decks in a bit, hits everything. Umesh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six percentage drops to 31.37. 65th over: India 266-7 (Thakur 39, Umesh 1) Boland with another tidy over but Thakur gets through it comfortably, taking a late single. A question from OBO regular Brian Withington. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Idly wondering what sort of attention this game between the top Test-playing nations is getting back in Australia, compared with say the forthcoming Ashes series? In passing, do you think England could gainfully host more Test matches that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feature the host nation, especially given the potential enthusiastic support from the diaspora of various test playing (and aspiring) nations?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Absolutely. I suspect that Bangladesh or Pakistan matches could get good attendances here, especially in certain cities. There is a story bubbling away about the Melbourne Cricket Ground campaigning to host an India-Pakistan Test, given neither country will tour the other. Diaspora crowds can fill out an India match in most countries these days, and some non-diaspora fans will also travel for the novelty. 64th over: India 265-7 (Thakur 38, Umesh 1) Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a stat for you: of players to have hit more than five Test sixes, Umesh Yadav has the second highest proportion of his career runs from going over the rope. Just under 32 percent, which is what Hasan Ali has as the ladder leader. He survives most of an over from Cummins though, and even scores a single off the bat. 63rd over: India 263-7 (Thakur 37, Umesh 0) Shardul Thakur takes a single off Boland, leg bye in fact. Umesh Yadav on strike. This may not last long. He knows one way, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mind the windows. But he too gets off strike thanks to a leg bye, into the thigh pad. The last partnership was 109. 62nd over: India 261-7 (Thakur 37) The wicket falls from the last ball of the over, and Cummins at last gets his second. What a catch that is! The old classic: Green drops the straightfoward one and then takes the world-beater. Flying edge from Rahane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drive, flying catch from Green away to his right, one huge arm snaking out like a sci-fi tentacle to reach that ball. Rahane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine innings comes to an end. 61st over: India 260-6 (Rahane 89, Thakur 36) Nip-backers deluxe from Boland to start, Rahane blocking studiously from the crease. A maiden over. The second session will begin as did the first, with Scott Boland from the Vauxhall End. The players are returning after the luncheon interval. Ahem. Adjust your bow ties, please, and stand to attention. Painful, that stuff, innit? Cue the old \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How many IPL runs did Bradman make,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I guess. If you want to see that ICC cable knit that Guy Hornsby wrote in about, feast your eyes. That was quite the session for those who like Australians dropping their bundle. And their catches. Two drops from Thakur, one drop from Rahane, and the no-ball lbw overturn against Thakur to go with Rahane getting the same reprieve yesterday. This has been a celestially blessed partnership for India, currently worth 108 runs. Rahane will come back after the break with another overseas hundred in his sights, and Thakur will\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 well, who knows what Thakur is thinking at any given time. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about action, not contemplation. KS Bharat was knocked over as soon as the day began, bowled by a Boland beauty, but the number of wicket-taking deliveries to follow have not taken any wickets. Back with you in half an hour or so. 60th over: India 260-6 (Rahane 89, Thakur 36) Talk about an eventful over before lunch. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review upheld, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review rejected, and India walk back with their seventh-wicket partnership intact. Australia losing composure. This time Thakur is plunging forward at a ball outside off stump, the ball zipping past his edge. Carey thinks there is a nick, Cummins is talked into the review, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing on the soundwave. Goodness me. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another overstep for Cummins, and another wicket wiped away. Great pace, great line, some movement off the seam inward, Shardul Thakur is nowhere against this ball. Smashes his pad in front of middle and leg. Given out on the field, so the review only needs it to clip the stumps. But the review shows the front foot is over, his sixth time this innings. 59th over: India 259-6 (Rahane 89, Thakur 36) More email flattery comes in, from Guy Hornsby. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Morning Geoff, absolutely loved your cable knit WTC cricket jumper on last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Final Word Daily. Where fashion and sport collide in the best way. Not sure I could sport that in Sicily today, where it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 31 degrees. This is a great fightback from this pair, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hope this goes to five days of hard fought cricket, though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d need another 100 at least to sway that. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent performance is doing nothing for my Ashes nerves either, despite the nature of causality and past performance and future performance and all that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on the way, Guy, as Rahane jumps onto his back foot and punches Lyon away sublimely through backward point. Shot! And raises the hundred partnership. Then gets forward two balls later and drives through cover for the same result. Behind by 210. This is some innings from Ajinkya Rahane. 58th over: India 249-6 (Rahane 80, Thakur 35) Standing ovation from the JM Finn stand, as Thakur pings away a flick shot from Cummins for four! It rockets to the fence down there behind square leg. The partnership is up to 97, the deficit is down to 220. 57th over: India 244-6 (Rahane 79, Thakur 31) At last it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for Nathan Lyon to have a bowl. Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start well, overpitches and Rahane drives him through cover for four. But Lyon doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long to settle, squaring up Thakur first ball to him 56th over: India 239-6 (Rahane 74, Thakur 31) Cummins back on to bowl and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another drop in the cordon! To quote Darren Lehmann, what the blank is going on? Big drive from Rahane, thick edge, flies hard and high to Warner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left. Tough chance, has to throw his hand at it and only has time to get one hand up. Like he was halfway through the first YMCA move. But if anyone was going to take that, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Warner, a freak at those sharp ones. Instead the ball ricochets away for a couple of runs. Wonder if that was Carey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s catch? He did twitch at it, and there has been miscommunication between Carey and his slips before. 55th over: India 234-6 (Rahane 71, Thakur 30) A cover drive for three, and the Master of the Mumbai maidans raises 5000 Test runs for his career. Nice to see him getting this chance to return to the team, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a champion performer for India especially in tougher contests away from home. Jeremy Yapp also knows how to nail an introduction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Loving the commentary as always but most of all, thanks for the searching examination of Steve Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technique. That article will be required reading in the England camp, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m guessing. Now, given that this is unlikely to be the closest or toughest Test Australia plays this summer, should they treat this as the ultimate grand final and pinnacle, or is it a warm-up? Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say Australia takes a healthy lead into the second innings and the top three does well. Is it cynical to play Green at 4 (and even Carey at 5) given that Smith and Travball have already had a bat? The answer to that will tell us a lot about how seriously this team is taking the ICC Championship concept.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I think they could do both, if they were far enough ahead, and changing the order wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean the match didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. But they would most likely stick to script to avoid any disruption in approach. Still, one thing most of us do in cricket is get ahead of ourselves. We look at the way things have gone, and extrapolate that they must continue the same way. But cricket trajectories are not even. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not predictable. A wicket will probably fall soon and Australia will wrap things up, but perhaps these two will bat all day and change the game. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we watch it, for the times when the unexpected happens. And no matter how many times we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the unexpected happen, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still surprised when it does. 54th over: India 229-6 (Rahane 68, Thakur 29) The Australians will be increasingly irritated by the fact that Shardul Thakur is still there. This is his knack. Gets a little nick (a nick knack?) that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t carry to Carey. Windscreen-wipes at a ball outside off stump and misses. Then thrashes Starc for a cut shot through point for four. 53rd over: India 223-6 (Rahane 67, Thakur 24) Green bowling, another nudge for Rahane through point for one. I wondered how many of his runs he has scored there. Then I remembered that I can look up things like that. It makes 27 of them, close to half his score, between point and deep third. Thakur gets him back on strike, and Rahane plays a rare leg glance to diversify his portfolio. The deficit is 246. 52nd over: India 220-6 (Rahane 65, Thakur 23) Starc on the long lop to the middle. Thakur loves to hit the ball unnecessarily hard. Tries another through cover and misses it. Gets a run to fine leg to follow. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re down to two slips now. Starc smashes Rahane on the pad but via the inside edge, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a ricochet run to backward point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Morning Geoff, excellent article on the resurgent Smudge,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Theo Boardman-Pretty. A polite start and an excellent name, good work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Looking ahead to next week, my thoughts are at the other end of the wicket: what happens when the tight line of Scott Boland (Test economy 2.18) meets the unstoppable force of Bazball (run rate 4.76 before the Ireland game)? Wickets, I suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m interested in. Sometimes, a very consistent bowler can be lined up by an attacking team. If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re willing to hit off the top of the bounce. But that brings attendant risk. No doubt England will go for it, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whether Boland gets enough from the pitch and can adapt. He was the best T20 death bowler in the country for a few years, so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dealt with attacking batting before. 51st over: India 217-6 (Rahane 64, Thakur 22) A rare quiet over from Green. Rahane pulls a single. Thakur squirts one along the floor. A bit like my housemate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cat. 50th over: India 215-6 (Rahane 63, Thakur 21) Starc comes round the wicket at the right-handers after drinks, looking for that angle in at the stumps. Strays down leg to Thakur after Rahane works a single. Once his line carries past off stump, Thakur can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help reaching at it. But when Starc gets too full, Shardul just about throws out his spinal alignment thrashing it through cover. Not surprising that many of our readers, like Sam, are seeing this as a three-way contest. Dean Kinsella is at the ground, I assume. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Really enjoying the cricket in the blazing sun. I hope its not too anglocentric to describe it as a curtain raiser for the main event, but its really getting Ashes juices flowing. Great to have a chance to see the Aussies in action against high class opposition. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know who benefits most - the Aussies to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwarm up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in a proper game, or England to have a good look at the opposition. I suspect that if India can somehow miraculously turn this game around the dent in Australian confidence might just swing it in England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favour. Come on Jinx!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bring back the Test Triangular Series from 1912! Bring back Warren Bardsley! Drinks for Jinks. And well, yes, the head agrees with this\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but another 55 minutes like the previous 55 would make things fun. 49th over: India 209-6 (Rahane 62, Thakur 16) The luck is with India again this morning. Cameron Green replaces Boland, fires one in fast at the pads that beats Rahane for pace, and clobbers him in front. Umpire says the angle might be taking it down leg. Australia review, and it shows red, red, orange. Not quite nailing the leg stump firmly enough to overturn the call. Rahane celebrates by slashing a boundary off the top edge over slip, streaky, then plays a no-follow-through gem of a cover drive for four more. Just steps into that and holds the pose. Steers a single to deep point. Eventful over! The weirdest part is Shardul Thakur offering a leave to the last ball. 48th over: India 199-6 (Rahane 53, Thakur 15) Mitchell Starc on for a spell, replacing Cummins. One six and the skipper takes himself off? (That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a joke.) Still, a win for India to get through that period, though it was the missed catch that did it. Starc slings them across the right-handers, gives up a couple of singles. Richard O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hagan writes in about the follow-on, or not. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How much do you think that the predicted heat over the weekend will play a part in that decision? I know it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be as much of an issue for either team as it is for we locals but surely it is still a factor when thinking about how much rest your bowlers might need? (On that note, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m playing a club game tomorrow and looking forward to our new Aussie all-rounder finally going an entire match without whining about how cold it is).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Australians in England in June have a constitutional right to complain about the cold, Richard. We will always defend that. The Met Office says a high of 29 over the weekend, which is pleasant early spring weather for either of these teams, so I doubt it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a factor. If things go Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still be a Day 4 finish. Or the current pair pile on another 150 and make things interesting. They trail by 269 runs. 47th over: India 196-6 (Rahane 52, Thakur 13) Boland carries on, Shardul Thakur showing some discipline with his blocking and leaving, then deflecting a ball to the fine leg boundary off his pad, and gamely dropping a short ball into the leg side, again imperilling his gloves. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been battered today, not sure how his bowling will go after this. 46th over: India 191-6 (Rahane 52, Thakur 12) A sudden flurry from Rahane! First he plays that same sort of shot, using the pace to deflect through point for four. Then Cummins drops a touch shorter and Rahane gets under a hook shot for six! Uses the pace and sends it over fine leg. Fair chance this is Rahane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last Test, and if so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going out in style. 45th over: India 178-6 (Rahane 41, Thakur 10) Rahane nicks one from Boland, but softly enough that it drops short of Green this time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tense out there. Just before that he drove a couple more runs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thinking about the best-case scenario for the teams,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Sam Jeffers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For Australia: Enforce follow on, India cave, game over late today. For India: Aus enforce follow on, India bat well (and slowly). Australia still win, but have to bat twice.For England: See India. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strange to have three teams playing a game of cricket.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m telling you, there will be no follow-on. 44th over: India 175-6 (Rahane 39, Thakur 9) Cummins in again, and Thakur is dropped again! Having some luck here, if you can call it that, given it means he has to stay out there and keep being peppered. Straightforward at gully for Green, the edge flies hard but straight at his midriff, hits his palms and bounces back out. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grab the rebound with Khawaja also sprawling towards it from slip. More contact as Cummins hits Thakur in the stomach. The batter swings wildly outside off, then finally connects with one for a run. There was another front-foot no ball in that over too, Cummins keeps overstepping. 43rd over: India 173-6 (Rahane 39, Thakur 8) Meanwhile, Rahane is playing like a dream. Soft hands, defending away. Boland from the Vauxhall End defused, then dabbed for a couple of runs. Beaten on the outside edge, then strides into a Meg Lanning style shot, straight bat, no follow-through, just places the bat in the line of the ball to send it through backward point for four. A message in from India, name withheld. Controversial. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, the follow-on looks inevitable unless the Aussies are very confident in their bowling in the 4th innings. I am still holding out hope for a classic day-long Pujara spell in our next innings, whenever that may be, to at least drag us to a draw! Off topic, it is very refreshing to be able to hear commentary on the radio again. All India Radio has the irritating habit of not covering cricket matches live. I suspect it is a combination of lack of rights and lack of interest, this being a one-off series perhaps helping the former. Either way, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refreshing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I would say that the chance of a follow-on is zero. Even if India are out quickly here, Australia will still want to give their players another bat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given this is their only planned match. Could be a a lovely centre-wicket net against top-line bowlers, especially for Warner, Khawaja, Green. And yes, live cricket on the radio in India has been defunct for a couple of decades now, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? Makes little sense given the interest in that market and the reach radio can have in regional areas, but TV is considered king by anyone in power there. 42nd over: India 167-6 (Rahane 33, Thakur 8) Nasty from Cummins! The ball rears from a length and clatters Thakur on his back arm. The physio comes and gives him a check, Thakur decides to bat on, and immediately gets hit again. Same spot, right forearm, on the fleshy bit but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still hurt plenty. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a longer delay for more physio treatment. Several people out there. They put an arm guard on him. Horse, meet stable door\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 oh, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Third ball in this lengthy sequence, in at the gloves! Smashes them. Punched away, literally. This is very unfriendly bowling. Then Cummins rips one past the outside edge! Thakur pulls the bat away too late, after stepping across. He was in all sorts. Breathes a sigh of relief that the over has finished. 41st over: India 166-6 (Rahane 32, Thakur 8) That ball goes wild! Pitches more towards a leg stump line but it careers off the seam way down leg side for four byes. Some movement. Then Boland draws a genuine edge from Thakur that flies away for four more. Undeservedly expensive over. 40th over: India 157-6 (Rahane 30, Thakur 4) Cummins from the Pavilion End, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also hitting a length and getting the ball to jag in. Rahane squeezes out a single off the inside edge. Thakur rides the bounce for two, then flashes outside off and is lucky to survive. 39th over: India 154-6 (Rahane 30, Thakur 2) That is such a Boland over. Wicket second ball. Cuts it in and smashes the gloves and body from the next couple. Then has a catch dropped at third slip! A tough one, over Khawaja\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head. He goes up with the ball, gets fingertips to it but tips it over the bar. Two runs result. Goodness me! What a delivery. On the other hand, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standard Scott Boland. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so good at that. Rahane takes a single to the leg side first ball, a touch too straight. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all you get from Boland in terms of bad deliveries. The next one hits that hard length outside off stump, jams back off the seam, cuts Bharat in half, straight through the gate, and hits middle stump. Bharat ends up squared up, leaning over, trying to figure out how that got through him. Incisive. Scott Boland with the ball in hand. Three slips and a gully for Rahane on strike. Cover is open. Deep backward point is out, interestingly. Fine leg the other in the deep. Mid off, mid on, midwicket. Here come the teams out to the middle. Another perfect day here at The Oval, might be a touch warmer than yesterday, scandalously venturing towards the mid 20s on the old Celcius scale. The roller is on the pitch preparing it for India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resumption. Send me an email? Had some inbox problems yesterday, sorry, and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t post up messages. But fingers crossed we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all good for today. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m geoff.lemon@theguardian.com. And if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the kind of person who wants to know about Steve Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technique and what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changed with it, I will go there with you. The headline assigned to this piece might be, just the tiniest bit, overstating it. For the detail, get yourself across the match report from The Burning One himself. Hola amigos. Day three of El Championship Test Mundial, or similar, is upon us. And let us be honest, India = in strife. They lost five wickets yesterday for nowhere near enough. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not like the Australians bowled the house down, but they bowled well enough at the right spots to get some assistance from the surface now and then, and that was enough. The four deliveries from the quicks that knocked over India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main batting crew all did heaps. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that old fighter Ajinkya Rahane resuming today with wicketkeeper KS Bharat, a mere 318 runs behind Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 469. But they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only one 300-run partnership away from parity, and Australia just about had one of those too, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible.

I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a big deal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think that the context is really important. The Conservatives did cause incredible harm to our economy in just one month last year under Liz Truss.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Louise Casey, the cross-bench peer who led a review into the Metropolitan police, has said she would work as a Labour minister under Keir Starmer if there was a role where she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could get something done\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She told the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Political Thinking with Nick Robinson podcast she supported his five \u00e2\u20ac\u0153missions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the country \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which cover growth, clean energy, the NHS, justice system and education \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but said she doubted he would make her a minister. She said: Whether you employ people like me to be a sort of tsar figure or whether you get a minister to do the job they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing, what we need is high quality people. And, you know, there are plenty of people younger than me that could do it as well. Lady Casey, who is a former deputy director of the homelessness charity Shelter, has worked in several high profile roles advising Labour- and Conservative-led governments, the latest of which was the Met report after the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer. John McDonnell, the Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington and former shadow chancellor under Jeremy Corbyn, said on Twitter it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretty clear that some in the Labour party are trying to sabotage the Green Prosperity Plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Writing in the Guardian, McDonnell said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153argument being put forward is that the bond markets will react to Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing in the same way they responded to Liz Truss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fantasy budget. This would make the necessary borrowing too expensive to deal with, and anyway, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impractical to spend on that scale in the early years of a government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Both of these arguments need exposing for what they really are: attempts to sabotage the central plank of the next Labour government.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wes Streeting, the shadow health and social care secretary, has said the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to delay Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to borrow \u00c2\u00a328bn a year for a green prosperity fund owing to a poor economic outlook. The party initially said it would spend \u00c2\u00a328bn a year on green investment until 2030 from its first year of coming to power, but Reeves said this morning it would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ramp up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to this figure by the halfway point of its first term in government. Streeting, considered to be on the right of the Labour party, said on Twitter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rachel is absolutely right to put the public finances first. The Tories showed what happens if you ignore economic reality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rishi Sunak is also due to speak at the Northern Research Group conference in Doncaster (see also 12.4pm) this afternoon, back in Britain from his US trip. As well as the prime minister and George Osborne, senior Conservatives former party chair Jake Berry and education secretary Gillian Keegan will also attend the event to discuss devolution, healthcare and energy. Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, was met with cheers when he spoke about tax cuts. He said: As Jeremy Hunt said at the dinner last night, I think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said it publicly before... the state is growing at over 2%, growth is at 1.6%, that is not fiscally responsible. So we need to grow the economy and make sure the economy is growing faster than the size of the state. I think we will be rewarded... I think we will reap the benefits of that very sensible fiscal position. Levelling up minister, Dehenna Davison, said backing tax cuts was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no brainer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for any Conservative. Labour and the Lib Dems have criticised the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan to drop windfall tax if oil and gas prices fall (see also 12.07pm), with Ed Davey claiming it is one of Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153biggest personal failures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Lib Dem leader said: The families and businesses still suffering so much from high energy bills will not forget the failure of the Conservatives to tax the windfall profits of the oil and gas companies properly. This out of touch government has shown yet again that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about people struggling just to get by, or the small business clinging on. This energy tax failure ranks as one of Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest personal failures as chancellor and prime minister. A Labour spokesperson said: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right that as oil and gas producers are making historically high profits that they are asked to contribute more. We need a proper windfall tax on the enormous profits of oil and gas giants to help ease the cost of living crisis. We will look at the detail of this change. Of course if the windfalls of war disappear then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll look at what the right long-term tax position should be for the North Sea. The Green party, meanwhile, said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beyond comprehension\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The government seems happy to allow these huge corporations to not only wreck the climate but to profit off the back of the cost of living crisis which they themselves have contributed to. Meanwhile, Sky News reports that the advisory firm where George Osborne is a partner has been enlisted to work on the $75bn takeover by Microsoft of Activision Blizzard, the maker of Call of Duty. Robey Warshaw, which the former chancellor joined as a partner in 2021, has reportedly been privately involved in the takeover for some time. Environmental and business experts at the University of Oxford have criticised Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement to delay green investment plans (see also 9.24am). Anupama Sen, head of policy at the university\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Smith school of enterprise and the environment, said: Policymakers shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be hesitant about or delay investing in technologies that speed up the transition to clean energy. Renewable energy technologies are inherently capital intensive, and require significant amounts of upfront capital investment, but have very low running costs once they are up and running. The savings from this could go towards lowering energy bills and improving our energy security in the medium to longer-term. Research at Oxford [Joule] shows that the faster we decarbonise, the faster the costs of clean energy will fall, and the sooner savings can be realised for UK consumers. We also have a good idea of what the policy challenges are required, and what needs to happen for us to get to a completely decarbonised energy system. Delaying the transition will not necessarily change things and in fact may increase costs as uncertainties increase. The former chancellor George Osborne has told his party to stop blaming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the blob\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more ambitious on devolution\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Speaking at the Northern Research Group conference in Doncaster, he said: Whitehall is very against devolution, as an orthodoxy. There are some Conservatives who blame \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe blob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and the civil servants and the establishment. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in office since 2010, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in charge of our country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destiny, and we should stop blaming others if we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get things right. He acknowledged worry about whether central government will have to step in to bail out devolved authorities in case of problems. But if you take that attitude, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t also let parts of the country take responsibility for their own future. And I think the Conservatives can afford to approach this by being much more ambitious on devolution. We should now be looking, as we fire up Northern Powerhouse 2.0, to give more power to local elected bodies, including metro mayors. The government has claimed that its plan to suspend the windfall tax on oil and gas companies if energy prices fall (see also 9.37am) will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safeguard thousands of jobs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A No 10 spokesperson said: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll remember that the energy profits levy was introduced last year to respond to exceptionally high prices that meant that oil and gas companies were benefiting from extraordinary profits. To protect domestic energy supply and safeguard thousands of jobs reliant on that sector, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve introduced the energy security investment mechanism, and that means that if oil and gas prices consistently fall back to normal levels before March 2028, which is when it would end anyway, the energy profits levy would be switched off. Asked whether the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns came from firms, the spokesperson said: Obviously, we continue to have conversations with energy companies as we do with all business sectors. Adrian Ramsay, the co-leader of the Greens, has accused Labour of rowing back at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the first sign of any difficulty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and claimed doubt over its \u00c2\u00a328bn green plan strengthened his party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of winning more seats at the next election. In response to Rachel Reeves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning (see also 9.24am), he said: This highlights more than ever why it is necessary to have more Green MPs elected at the next general election. We are witnessing environmental breakdown at an increasingly alarming rate, so you would have thought the Labour party would understand that we need to see a transformational change if we are going to tackle the climate emergency along with the cost of living crisis that is causing so much harm in our society. Yet once again we see them offer a policy that does not go far enough, and then row back at the first sign of any difficulty. The Conservative party chair, Greg Hands, has also weighed in on Rachel Reeves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, claiming Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153main economic policy is in tatters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He added: It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter if they try and pretend otherwise, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan remains to stick \u00c2\u00a328bn of borrowing on the government credit card which will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates. Jess Ralston, the head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), claimed the UK is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuck in the mud\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Since the Inflation Reduction Act was passed nearly a year ago, spades have hit the ground in the US, but the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been stuck in the mud. Whichever party is in charge in the coming years will have to prove why organisations should invest here compared to the US or EU, and with the global race heating up, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really no time to lose. Sue Ferns, tje deputy general secretary of Prospect, a trade union representing engineers and scientists, said: It is not only just about the total investment, which of course is important, but also about giving investors, companies and the workforce long-term certainty. This is something which the current government have failed to do. Any proper plan must put developing the skilled workforce that we need, and making sure that no communities are left behind as we transition to clean energy, front and centre. More reaction to Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s green prosperity announcement: James Murray, editor of Business Green, said: Fatima-Zahra Ibrahim, co-director of Green New Deal Rising campaign group, said: Guardian columnist Aditya Chakrabortty said: Will McCallum, co-executive director of Greenpeace, said: Responding to Rachel Reeves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments about Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s green investment on the Today programme (see also 9.24am and 9.45am) Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of politics, said: Any U-turn would be a huge mistake. Without the necessary immediate investment, we will lose out on the creation of thousands of jobs needed as we phase out fossil fuels, and we will lose out on the opportunity to put green tech industries at the centre of our economy. Rachel Reeves rightly cites the opportunities of green growth, but this prevarication on confirming the scale of investment needed from the start of a new Labour government risks throwing in the towel on the global race in green tech, with the US, China and the EU already far ahead. It would be simply bad economics to say that we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford this now when it would pay for itself. Green infrastructure investment is now one of the best economic growth generators, and with it the opportunity to lower bills and tackle the climate crisis. Labour mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let this go. England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest teaching union is threatening to hold strikes before the end of the school term this summer unless the government restarts talks over pay, school funding and working conditions. In a letter to the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, the National Education Union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general secretaries give the government until 17 June to resume negotiations or risk further school closures. The NEU said: Should this letter be ignored, and negotiations are not in place by the 17 June the NEU national executive will be discussing our next steps. This will include the consideration of NEU teacher members in England taking further strike action in the week beginning 3 July. The NEU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter notes that Keegan has not responded to an earlier request to publish the recommendations of the independent School Teacher Review Body (STRB), which are said to advise a 6.5% pay rise. The NEU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter to Keegan states: There are six school term weeks until the summer holiday. Up and down the country, head teachers are trying to plan their school budgets for next year and trying to cope with the rapidly growing problem of recruiting enough teachers to fill their classrooms. By not publishing the STRB report, your department is withholding vital information about what proposals that body has made on teacher pay, which may or may not help with the recruitment difficulties. It is also withholding vital information about the funding of pay rises. The levelling up minister Dehenna Davison has called for the creation of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new towns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and garden cities. Speaking at the Northern Research Group conference, the MP for Bishop Auckland said: I would certainly like new towns, garden cities - I would like to see us be bold and brave. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be building new towns and garden cities that we would see as big commuter hubs. She also suggested that it would result in Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nicking jobs from all over the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153keeping people in parts of the country that we want to see people in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rishi Sunak has been urged to step in to block the former prime minister Boris Johnson from handing honours to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153carousel of cronies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The prime minister is reportedly set to sign off Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honours list, which is understood to include about 50 names and could lead to two byelections, within weeks. Labour has renewed its calls for the list to be stopped. It comes amid reports that the list is likely to be made public today. Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, said Sunak had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153caved in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to appease his divided party, accusing the prime minister of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too weak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to block them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of the people on that list, it just looks like a carousel of Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cronies and, frankly, the prime minister has caved in yet again because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warring factions in the Conservative party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re so divided and fragmented and the prime minister realises that if he wants to keep the sort of Johnson wing of his party quiet he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to ... Some of the names on there are very, very dubious indeed and the prime minister should not be accepting them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fresh from the US, where he and Joe Biden signed the Atlantic declaration, Rishi Sunak is expected to address a conference of Conservatives in the north of England later today. The prime minister is to appear in Doncaster this afternoon for the Northern Research Group conference. Among those also expected to attend are the former Conservative party chair Jake Berry, the education secretary, Gillian Keegan, and the former chancellor George Osborne. Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley mayor, said the event was aimed at making sure ministers do not backtrack on the levelling-up agenda. He told Times Radio it was about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making sure we get more powers and making sure we can create better communities and opportunities and jobs for local people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Responding to Rachel Reeves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 comments this morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and an article in the Times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ed Miliband, shadow climate and net zero secretary, has shared his support for the reneged green prosperity plans (see also 9.24am). He tweeted: Meanwhile, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, has offered the North Sea oil and gas industry a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get-out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd clause from the windfall tax on fossil fuel profits if wholesale energy market prices fall back to normal levels. Jillian Ambrose reports: The chancellor hopes to boost investment in the North Sea by agreeing to suspend the windfall tax on oil profits if the market price for Brent crude falls below $71.40 a barrel, and gas prices fall below 54p a therm, for a period of six months. The global oil price is now about $75 a barrel, and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gas price is about 64 p/th. The Treasury has put forward the change a little over six months after raising the energy profits levy from 25% to 35%, on top of the usual 40% rate of tax, and extending the regime by two years until 2028. It is expected to raise tens of billions of pounds to help cover the cost of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for energy bills. The government said its levy had raised about \u00c2\u00a32.8bn to date, and it did not expect the new changes to have an impact on the tax receipts based on current forecasts for energy market prices. The levy attracted fierce criticism from the North Sea industry, which claimed it could put the brakes on new investment in oil and gas projects at a time when the government hopes to increase domestic fossil fuel production. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s admission from the shadow chancellor (see 9.24am) comes less than two years after Rachel Reeves pledged \u00c2\u00a328bn a year in climate measures until 2030 to protect Britain from disaster and told Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party conference that she would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the first green chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Labour said in September 2021 that the amount would quadruple the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current capital investment. In total the party said it would commit \u00c2\u00a3224bn on climate measures over the next eight years. Targets for spending were planned to include gigafactories to build batteries for electric vehicles, the hydrogen industry, offshore wind turbines made in Britain, cycle paths and flood defences, Jessica Elgot reported at the time. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the full story from our Whitehall editor, Rowena Mason: Labour has admitted that its \u00c2\u00a328bn green prosperity plan may have to be watered down. Blaming the Tories, who she said had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crashed our economy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, this morning said she could not supply a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153final set of numbers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on spending until a further fiscal statement from the government. She told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: The other thing that has happened in last two years is the Tories have crashed our economy, and as a result interest rates have gone up 12 times, inflation is now at 8.7% and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always said our fiscal rules are non-negotiable. Economic stability, financial stability, always has to come first and it will do with Labour. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to ramp up and phase up our plans to get to the investment we need to secure these jobs so that it is also consistent with those fiscal rules to get debt down as a share of GDP and to balance day-to-day spending. The \u00c2\u00a328bn figure, previously given by Labour, would instead be a target to work towards, she said, rather than the initial sum allocated for the plan in the first year of government, as the party had previously pledged. She also said she is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153staggered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the prime minister has returned from the US with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no industrial plan\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Britain after Rishi Sunak and the US president, Joe Biden, announced the Atlantic declaration: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m staggered, frankly, that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s come back with no industrial plan for Britain to seize the opportunities that they are seizing in the US. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking after the politics blog today.

Alcaraz, though, responds well, making 40-30 with a ninja\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forehand then, when Djokovic botches a drive-volley following another stupendous return, he takes the chance to lamps a forehand pass that keeps him in the set. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not playing badly, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just playing the greatest with a grudge. Alcaraz 1-4 Djokovic* Men and boys so far, Djokovic at the top of his game \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sorry, the absolute top of his game. He knows the threat Alcaraz poses, won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enjoyed someone other than him being the favourite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tennis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest nurturer of injustices since Connors and McEnroe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and consolidates to 30 despite sending down his first double. *Alcaraz 1-3 Djokovic Lost in the supermarket, Alcaraz wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t born as much as he fell out, nobody seemed to notice him eventually opts for a drop \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and sends it wide for 0-15. No matter, he makes 30-15 and Mac declares him the best 19-year-old he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever seen, though not as good as Becker at 17 and 18. Anyhow, they wind up duking it out at the net, Djokovic somehow wins an exchange he should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been out of, and an incredible forehand return \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of a good serve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sets up our first break point. Here we go \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and have an absolute look! A glooorious drop sees Alcaraz haring to the net, he does an amazing job of simply reaching it but also conjures a fine response that has Djokovic curling the ball around the net-post from by the umpire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair. Alcaraz manages to get the ball back, but a tapped then volley bounces into the chasmic space behind him, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the breakthrough! Djokovic raises an arm to the crowd, and well he might; he is steaming hot, like a man with history in his grasp. Alcaraz 1-2 Djokovic* A terrific forehand from Djokovic, thwacked cross-court and on the run, gets him 15-all, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really hitting the shot with a lot of pop; I reckon he fancies his chances of outhitting Alcaraz, for consistency but perhaps also for power. But after a really good serve down the T, well returned by Alcaraz, he goes for too much and drops long; 30-all. So a serve out wide follows, backed up by a lovely volley into the open space, then a murderous angle, cut obliquely to break the sideline, secures the hold. I think Djokovic has made every first serve so far; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly settled the sooner. *Alcaraz 1-1 Djokovic Djokovic has his head in this match, a succession of forehands making 15-all. But then he hits wide when up in the rally, Alcaraz finds a delicious angle on a whipped forehand, then unfurls a further succession to secure his hold. Alcaraz 0-1 Djokovic* (denotes server) Djokovic begins with three first serves, Alcaraz able to return none, but just as it looks like the Serb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forehand is closing out the game, a topspinner down the line makes 15-40; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s into the match. But then another fine delivery is sent back long, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very impressive start from the number three seed. For this to be the match of the tournament, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to be special, because Muchova v Sabalenka was sensational. But here we go, Djokovic to serve. Play. Of course, this match is only happening now because Daniil Medvedev won Rome, pushing Djokovic down to number three in the world. However, though I understand why they draw the brackets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to make sure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the same players playing each other every tournament \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at majors, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d always do 1v4 and 2v3 in the semis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just like to respond to William\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point\",\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd emails Upender, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and say that while Nadal had to emerge and challenge Federer at his absolute dominant peak, Djokovic had to drag himself up \u00e2\u20ac\u201d from being a fairly distant world number 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and beat Nadal at his peak. He also saw off a couple of resurgent periods from Federer, 2015 a case in point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The way I see it, Federer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best was better than Nadal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best \u00e2\u20ac\u201c apart from on clay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Djokovic was and is the hardest player to beat. Alcaraz just shines with implacable confidence and inner peace. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ridiculous. Our players are ready to emerge, and here they come! Mac, resplendent in Strokes tee, is leaning Alcaraz \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I love how much he already loves him, especially given how easy it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be for someone of his epochal brilliance to be sniffy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I, now that you ask, am leaning Djokovic. You can only get ready to play Djokovic in a slam by playing Djokovic in a slam, and though Alcaraz won their sole previous meeting and it was on clay, it finished (5)6-7 7-6 7-6(5). I guess we might argue Alcaraz has improved more since then, but until we see him out there in this situation, we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read much into it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Am hoping today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an inflection point in men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tennis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tweets Shane Thomas, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but I find it hard to envision Djokovic getting knocked off in a Slam until someone knocks him off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yup, no one beats Djokovic easily, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not been beaten in a major \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Rafa in Paris apart \u00e2\u20ac\u201c since the final of the US in 2021. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only played two since then, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d also won the three prior to then which, as you say, makes it hard to think hell be beaten until he is. So how will this match unfold? Luckily, Calv Betton, our resident coach, messages with analysis I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m about to pass off as my own: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down to belief. Alcaraz doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the scar-tissue of having being duffed by Djokovic for half a decade like all the last generation do. He thinks he can beat him. Tactically Alcaraz will be the aggressor. Djokovic will look to make balls and move him around. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come down to whether Alcaraz can hit through him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Email! \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am sure you will be hearing from others about this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd begins William Prudham, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but I think it is problematic for you to simply declare in your preamble to the match today that Novak Djokovic is the greatest male tennis player who ever lived. I am sure you can guess that I disagree but the point is that this is a matter of real debate based on match stats and career achievements. And the debate is not settled, as no doubt you know. There is no need to do that and it is disrespectful to Nadal in particular who had to emerge and challenge Federer when Federer was peak Federer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just, like, my opinion, man. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disrespectful to say that I consider Djokovic greater than Nadal, though I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the big man can cope, but I do think Federer hated playing Djokovic much more than he hated playing Nadal. Salut! And welcome to Roland-Garros 2023 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c day 13! Individual sport is a funny thing: we may have our personal favourites, but in the main players come and go as we move on. Of course, there are those who sustain, often because they come to represent something greater than themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe, Martina Navratilova \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or particularly appealing qualities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but in the main, our obsession is with the thing itself, so anything that augments its overall glory gets us going. Take today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first semi-final, for example. Most of us watching won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much care who wins, yet all of us watching are embarrassingly invested in how that winning comes about, buzzing at the prospect and exercising all that remains of our feeble brains to try and predict how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to go. Novak Djokovic is the greatest male tennis player who ever lived. He might not have John McEnroe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feel, Pete Sampras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 serve, Roger Federer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beauty or Rafael Nadal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forehand, but if you asked any of those who they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d feel least confident about beating, chances are they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d answer him. There is simply no antidote to his combination of elasticity, consistency and composure, which is one reason he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll end his career out on his own \u00e2\u20ac\u201c potentially waaaay out on his own \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as the, er, most winningest man of all time. But maybe not for long, because \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and yes I know exactly how ridiculous this sounds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of Carlos Alcaraz. True, one of them has 22 majors and the other just one, taken in a tournament missing Djokovic. But make no mistake, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re watching the growth of an all-time great, and one unlikely to spend most of his career battling two other all-time greats and another near all-time great for the four Slams on offer each year. Even at 20, Alcaraz is the complete player \u00e2\u20ac\u201c far more so than was Djokovic, who won his first biggun at 21 but didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t grab them regularly until 27. He knows exactly how good his all-court game is and attacks every match like he expects to win, but also like he must deserve to win, a gorgeous combination of superiority and intensity. He is a joke. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just our first match! Then when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s through, we get to enjoy Casper Ruud v Alexander Zverev, on the face of things a fight to decide who loses the final. Except sport doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work like that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and nor do the individuals who play it. On y va!

How is your knowledge of Champions League and European Cup finals? I tested this one out yesterday before it was published and scored a disgraceful 10/16. Some ropey answers in the pre-1992 questions. My colleague John Brewin fared much better with 15. Have a go and let us know your scores. An email. This one comes from Kurt Perleberg and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to argue with, unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a Manchester City or Inter fan of the Milan kind, of course. As you and me all know the biggest story in not just football but all of sport this week is Lionel Messi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocking transfer to Major League Soccer (MLS) side Inter Miami. Another Bundesliga related transfer titbit for you, here, with Konrad Laimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move from RB Leipzig to Bayern Munich confirmed. The 26-year-old joins on a free transfer. Not like Bayern to sweep up all the talent from German football\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lesser lights, is it? Incidentally, you can keep up to scratch on all this summer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transfer deals from Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big five leagues on The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interactive transfer tracker. Naby Ke\u00c3\u00afta has a new club. After his release from Liverpool, the midfielder has returned to the Bundesliga and joined Werder Bremen. He should do well there. Thanks Will. A nice busy pre-Champions League final day to get me going then. The question many are asking is: do Inter have any chance whatsoever in Istanbul? Our resident Italian football expert Nicky Bandini picks out five players in Simone Inzaghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team who could cause Manchester City some problems. (And I for one am shocked that Romelu Lukaku hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made the cut). Right, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yer lot from me. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m handing over to Dominic Booth, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making his debut on the blog. Remember to be kind online, please. Speaking to BBC Radio Manchester, Kyle Walker has reiterated his desire to match the United side which overcame Bayern Munich at the Camp Nou 24 years ago to secure an unprecedented Treble. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think when we won the Premier League we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to talk about the Treble because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve still got a game at Wembley against your arch rivals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, when that win came, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat about the bush \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there. If us players want to go and be associated with the team of Manchester United [in 1999] we need to take this opportunity. Hopefully we can do it, walk out from Istanbul with a beer in our hands celebrating and be Treble winners.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can never have too much Jonathan Wilson, can you? Here he is with the tactical lowdown on Inter, whose front two, back three, attacking wing-backs and muscular midfield could all cause problems for City. Back to the Champions League final, then. City fans have started to arrive in Istanbul and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve brought their giant banners with them. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little reminder of Foster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heroics as Wrexham clinched the National League title, thanks in no small part to his penalty save to deny Cedwyn Scott as the Welsh side won 3-2 against their nearest rivals, Notts County, at the Racecourse Ground. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take our tatty old Champions League hat off for a second, and replace it with the shimmering tiara of League Two. In news that will come as sweet music to the ears of Wrexham fans, Ben Foster has signed a one-year contract extension and will stick with the newly promoted side for their first season in the Football League for 15 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the end of last season it was obvious that I enjoyed being at the club, I loved being part of the team and everything that Wrexham stands for,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d decided before the end of last season I wanted to do it, because it feels like home. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never joined a football club and felt at ease so quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More transfer news? Oh, go on then. Over in the WSL, Chelsea have signed Catarina Macario from Lyon on a three-year contract. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to get started here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the USA forward told the club website. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really happy to sign for Chelsea and I hope to represent the jersey well over the next few years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some transfer news for you now. Having moved to France last September, Ross Barkley has been released by Nice and is now a free agent. Nicolas P\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00a9 and Joe Bryan will also depart the club, having spent the season on loan from Arsenal and Fulham respectively. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live before making the trip to Turkey, Erling Haaland has raised the terrifying prospect of getting better at football. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am still young and can improve a lot,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are a lot of things I can do as there is a lot to improve. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I am in the perfect place, working with the best coach and the best players in the world. Pep is a details freak and all about developing them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one more to be going on with: John Stones on his standout season and how he has turned things around under Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidance. Phil Mongredien isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as impressed by City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relentless onwards march. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many football fans actively loathe the way that City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial muscle has distorted the English game over the past 15 years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he notes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having succeeded in making the Premier League so boringly predictable, extending that chokehold to Europe by beating Inter on Saturday would hardly be something to celebrate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before we even get to the more than 100 financial doping charges brought against the club by the Premier League earlier this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which they vociferously deny. As long as this enormous question mark is hanging over whether they reached their position of dominance by effectively cheating, why would any neutral want them to (further) prosper?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Karen Carney feels City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success is symptomatic of the strength of the Premier League more broadly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The competitive nature of the Premier League is helping its clubs in Europe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she writes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153City rarely had an easy weekend this season and had to fight for their points, regardless of who they were playing. There is strength throughout the league, which means the best teams have to push themselves \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the need to maintain standards benefits a club such as City when they face quality opposition in the Champions League.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jonathan Wilson has dipped into the 15th anniversary edition of Inverting the Pyramid, charting the rise of superclubs, mega-spending, celebrity players and modern managers. Contains added Guardiola. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kick off with some of our coverage from the past week, building up to the big game in Istanbul. First up, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Kyle Walker had to say when asked about City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition of emulating Manchester United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1999 Treble winners. The countdown to the Champions League final has begun, with Manchester City and Inter fans no doubt veering between excitement, anxiety and deep, gut-wrenching nausea. This is it: the Big One, the Grand Finale, the Golden Goblet, the Destroyer of Worlds. Pep Guardiola laid out what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at stake earlier this week when he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must accept that if we want to make a definitive step as a big club, we must win in Europe. We have to win the Champions [League] \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t avoid.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd No pressure, then, lads. Not that pressure has been much of a problem this season, given City have already won the Double and utterly crushed all challengers to their imperial dominance."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2023/jun/09/mortgages-hsbc-deals-nationwide-raises-rates-north-sea-vodafone-business-live", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "Mortgage turbulence continues as HSBC pulls deals; UK house prices \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcto fall 10%\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c business live", "lead": "HSBC temporarily removes mortgage products for new customers, as borrowers face higher rates", "author": "Graeme Wearden", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T13:25:11Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896538", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c910304d8a76502a8a9968759c0b50b04de310e6/0_69_3271_1963/500.jpg", "body": "UK lenders and homeowners will be watching the Bank of England closely over the next two weeks, ahead of its next interest rate decision on June 22. Today, the money markets say there is a 93% chance that the BoE lifts bank rate by a quarter point, to 4.75%, which would be the 13th rise in a row. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small possibility (7%) that the Bank plumps for a half-point rise, according to current market pricing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not only the domestic property market that is feeling pressure. The rise of hybrid working will prompt many large corporate employers to reduce their office space over the next three years, according to research from estate agents Knight Frank released earlier this week. Most expect to shrink their global portfolios by between 10% and 20%. Elsewhere in the global economy, Canada lost over 17,000 jobs last month as unemployment climbed for the first time since last summer. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy lost a net 17,300 jobs in May, new data from Statistics Canada shows, dashing expectations of a rise of around 23,000. Among young people, aged 15 to 24, employment fell by 77,000 (-2.8%) in May. In another blow, the unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage points to 5.2% in May. This was the first monthly increase since August 2022. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy, like the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, has been hit by high inflation over the last year, prompting a series of interest rate rises to dampen demand. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report shows that Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s services sector lost over 40,00 jobs, led by fally in business, building and other support services, as well as professional, scientific and technical services. Employment in the goods producing sector grew by a net 22,800 jobs, largely in manufacturing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a challenging week in the property sector: The Bank of England has already raised UK interest rates 12 times since December 2021, as it fights inflation. Capital Economics warn, though, that the impact of those hikes has not been fully felt yet: Higher interest rates haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dented the real economy much because household incomes have been unusually strong and the interest rates households are actually paying on their loans has not yet risen much. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an element of keeping the faith here. Higher interest rates will eventually bite harder. Indeed, lots of lenders withdrew their mortgage deals this week and will soon replace them with ones carrying higher interest rates. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we remain in the recession club, even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lonely place to be. The UK competition watchdog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to block Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover of Activision Blizzard annoyed both parties, but the gaming deal could prove lucrative to George Osborne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City advisory firm. Sky News are reporting that Robey Warshaw, where former chancellor Osborne is a partner, has landed a key role on the $69bn takeover deal. They say: City sources said the firm, which Mr Osborne joined as a partner in 2021, had been involved in the takeover for some time, although its role has not been publicly disclosed. The deal has become engulfed in controversy after the Competition and Markets Authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (CMA) decision to block it. Regulators elsewhere have approved it, with Microsoft pledging a string of licensing concessions involving rival gaming platforms, prompting the technology behemoth to accuse the UK of stymying innovation. Earlier this week, the president of Microsoft met with chancellor Jeremy Hunt, amid efforts to overturn the competition watchdog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to block its planned takeover of Activision Blizzard, which makes Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, and Candy Crush. Activision has been given permission to intervene in Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal battle with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-trust regulator over its decision to block the deal, Reuters reports today. Microsoft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal at the Competition Appeal Tribunalis expected to be heard next month, and Activision will also be able to make their case to the tribunal. Austerity-driver Osborne joined Robey Warshaw in April 2021, and shared a \u00c2\u00a326.5m payout for his first year working there. Over in Moscow, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank had left its key interest rate unchanged at 7.5%, but warned that inflation risks are rising. The Bank of Russia said that prices are rising at a faster rate, but the economy is also strengthening more than anticipated. It says: Current price growth rates, including the stable indicators of inflation, continue to increase. Inflation expectations of households and businesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 price expectations remain high. Economic activity is rising faster than the Bank of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s April forecast assumed, which in large measure reflects a strong rebound in domestic demand. Accelerating fiscal spending, deteriorating terms of foreign trade and the situation in the labour market remain pro-inflationary risk drivers. The overall balance of inflation risks has tilted even more to the upside. The Bank of Russia adds that it could increase interest rates at its next meetings to stabilise inflation near 4%. It estimates that the current rate of price growth is about 4% per year, but recovering consumer demand and the weak rouble (at a two-month low today) could add to inflationary pressures. The number of home loan products available in the UK was 5,056 on Friday, according to data company Moneyfacts Group Plc, Bloomberg reports, as lender rush to withdraw and reprice deals. Bloomberg adds: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about 4% lower than at the start of May, but the highest daily amount this month, suggesting some lenders may be putting deals back on the market at higher rates. The move is the latest blow to Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cash-strapped homeowners, who are already grappling with higher borrowing costs and a possible drop in house prices. Households are being forced to cut down other expenses to cover higher loan repayments, while many prospective buyers are avoiding the mortgage market altogether. Rishi Sunak was lambasted as a latter-day Edward Heath last month, after reports that the government wanted supermarkets to voluntarily limit the cost of essential food items. But in France, the spirit of state intervention is alive and well, with Paris strong-arming large food suppliers to cut their prices. The biggest food industry companies in France have pledged to cut prices on hundreds of products from next month, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said today, threatening financial sanctions if they break the promise. The government is furious that prices consumers pay in supermarkets have hit record levels in recent months even though the prices industry pays for many raw materials have been declining. Le Maire has previously threatened to claw back what he described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd profits from food companies with special taxes if they did not pass on falling raw materials prices to consumers already struggling with high energy prices. Le Maire told BFM TV on Friday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As soon as July, prices of certain products will go down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be checks and there we will be sanctions for those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t abide by the rules,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Le Maire mentioned pasta, poultry and oil as some of the products on which prices will be cut. Back in the City, shares in specialist chemicals firm Croda have tumbled by 13% this morning after it issued a profits warning. Croda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crop protection division \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which makes chemicals for the agriculture sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been hit by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rapid customer destocking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd this year. It has also been hit by lower sales of its lipid components which go into Covid-19 vaccines. The company, based in Snaith, Yorkshire, told shareholders it now expects pre-tax profits of between \u00c2\u00a3370m and \u00c2\u00a3400m this year. Analysts had expected \u00c2\u00a3468m, according to Refinitiv data. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says economic uncertainty is hitting Croda, as well as easing demand for Covid-19 vaccine ingredients. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The chemicals business soared during the pandemic thanks to its acquisition of Avanti Polar Lipids in July 2020. This made Croda one of the few companies able to make LMPs or lipid nanoparticles, fatty molecules used in drugs and vaccines to encase and protect the stuff in the drugs and vaccines that help people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including in mRNA treatments like the Covid vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inevitably the retreat of the pandemic had an impact on demand in this area and helped to dampen some of investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 excitement around the business, even if longer-term mRNA has a role to play in other types of medicine. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross domestic product fell by 10.5% in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period a year ago, the economy ministry said today. Reuters has the details: The ministry said in a statement the fall was less than it had initially expected, indicating the economy was adapting to events following Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion more quickly than expected. The ministry said it had initially expected GDP to fall by 14.1% in the first quarter of 2023. Over in Italy, factory output has taken a knock. Italian industrial production index decreased by 1.9% month-on-month in April, and was 7.2% lower than a year ago. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a disappointing economic signal, a day after the eurozone slipped into recession after contracting slightly over the last six months. Update: ING say: This is a poor reading, which suggests that softening demand is, for the time being, outweighing the positive effect on supply of improving supply chains and declining energy prices. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s have also analysed the consequences of a larger drop in UK house prices over the next two years. They warn that a hypothetical 21% drop in UK house prices would increase credit risks, and also push the UK into an economic downturn. In their new report, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say: We simulate the macro implications of a 21% decline over two years to assess credit implications for UK issuers. The UK sovereign would enter a recession in the second half of 2023, lasting for six quarters. Unemployment would reach 6% by end 2024, still below its peak in the global financial crisis. The UK economy would weaken, but healthy household balance sheets and a highly competitive services sector would soften the blow. Fiscal implications would be more significant, with government debt increasing from already high levels. Banks would face higher credit losses, though a large rise in defaults is still unlikely given the limited increase in unemployment and forward-looking provisions already banks have made. Buying agent Henry Pryor estimates that house values have already taken a 10% hit so far this year: Pryor also reckons it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbusiness as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the top-end of the market: The glass cliff hypothesis suggests that female executives are more likely to be put in charge when the company is already in a crisis. And Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, is taking the glass cliff theory into monetary policy by appointing the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first female central bank chief. Hafize Gaye Erkan, a finance executive in the United States, has been appointed to head Turkey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central bank, at a time when high inflation and a record weak currency is piling pressure on policymakers. Erkan is a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, and is currently a board director at Marsh McLennan. She had been co-chief executive of San Francisco-based First Republic Bank until leaving at the end of 2021 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less than 18 months before the bank was rescued in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s panic. Although the central bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first female governor, Erkan is also its fifth chief in just four years. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an has sacked several predecessors over policy differences, as he demanded interest rate cuts which have weakened the lira and driven up inflation. Erkan will replace Sahap Kavcioglu, who spearheaded Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rate-cutting drive that set off a historic currency crash in 2021 and sent inflation to a 24-year peak above 85% last year. Turkish interest rates have been cut from 19% two years ago to 8.5% at present. Inflation fell last month, to 39.6%\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of living crisis has driven down sales on the high streets, which turned negative for the first time in more than two years Total like-for-like retail sales, combining in-store and online, fell by 1.5% overall compared with last May, according to business advisory firm BDO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest High Street Sales Tracker. Online sales fell by 3.3%, one of the lowest results recorded outside of the pandemic, while in-store sales rose by just 1% across the month. Given the high inflation rates, these figures suggest significant drops in volumes, explains Sophie Michael, head of retail and wholesale at BDO LLP, who called the results \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely discouraging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Miichael adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With three bank holidays last month and the fact that footfall has increased compared to this time last year, these results highlight the huge pressure on the consumer purse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The drop in online sales is also stark, recording the worst online sales results on record with the exception of the months impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The homewares sector recorded a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very poor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd total fall of 9.2% in May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as shoppers shunned expensive items such as furniture and electronics. Fashion sales fell 1.5%. The consumer group Which? has reported Tesco to the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition watchdog over the supermarket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failure to provide detailed pricing information on its loyalty card offers. The group said the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest retailer had not clearly explained the unit price of deals for its Clubcard holders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as the price per 100g or 100ml \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so that shoppers could easily compare value for money between different sized packages, bottles, brands and retailers. It said the lack of unit pricing could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misleading practice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd under consumer protection regulations because it could make it difficult for shoppers to determine which was the cheapest product. In one example, Which? found a 700g bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup in Tesco for which the label showed the standard price to be \u00c2\u00a33.90, or 55.7p per 100g. A prominent Clubcard label showed the same size bottle on offer at \u00c2\u00a33.50, but the unit price, which would be 50p per 100g, was not given. At the same time a 910g bottle of the same ketchup on the shelf below was priced at \u00c2\u00a33.99, or 43.8p per 100g, for all shoppers, making it the cheapest option per 100g. Which? argued many shoppers would wrongly assume the Clubcard option was the best deal available. Rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has added to the dilemma facing UK housebuyers, by predicting prices will fall 10% over the next two years. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s believes that persistently high inflation and the recent spike in lending rates will trigger a correction in the UK housing market. In a report issued last night, Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say: The combination of less affordable mortgages and high inflation putting a dent in incomes will trigger a correction in the UK housing market. The relatively large share of short-dated or variable-rate mortgages exposes the existing stock to tightening monetary policy. Strong fundamentals such as a robust labour market, tight underwriting standards and housing supply shortages will prevent more severe credit implications. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warns that the correction in UK house prices will be more pronounced than in many other advanced economies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because the UK has a high proportion of variable or short-term fixed mortgages, compared to other countries such as Germany, the US or France where mortgages have longer maturities. Buy-to-let landlords, who hold 8% of the UK private housing stock, will also influence house prices if a large number choose to sell. Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say: To be eligible to refinance, landlords must comply with regulatory requirements to ensure rental income is sufficient to support mortgage payment costs. Landlords can pass on these costs to tenants, but for an average mortgage, this would mean raising rents by close to 20%, according to BOE estimates. Rents are currently increasing by around 5%. There is anecdotal evidence that landlords are choosing to sell properties instead, putting additional downward pressure on house prices. The turbulence in the UK mortgage market is being driven by high inflation, and expectations that the Bank of England will continue to raise interest rates to fight it. So explains Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz and President of Queens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 College, Cambridge. He told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme: People expect that the cost of mortgages will go up. And if you are someone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to get a mortgage, you will accelerate the demand for getting that mortgage. Why pay more tomorrow, when you can pay less today? And if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re HSBC, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen lots of people turn up wanting mortgages and you worry about two things. One is will I make money on those mortgages? And two, can I operationally handle these. HSBC made the judgement that its sustainability, the ability to do business under these conditions, is threatened so it took a very dramatic move. And all this comes down to a simple fact. Inflation is still too high. And people expect the Bank of England to increase interest rates more. UK inflation rose by 8.7% in the year to April, four times over the BoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2% target. City traders expect interest rates will rise again this month, to 4.75%, and could hit 5.5% by the end of this year. These expectations are pushing up the yield, or interest, on short-term government bonds, which are used to price fixed-term mortgages. UK mortgage brokers were startled by the speed at which HSBC pulled its mortgage offers for new customers yesterday. Paul Neal, mortgages &amp; equity release advisor at Missing Element Mortgage Services, says the move came without warning: Yet again we find ourselves with another lender dropping out of the market until they release new products. This time with no warning. How are we supposed to give our clients best value when a lender pulls rates with zero notice? This just highlights the importance of a minimum withdrawal period. Ashley Thomas, director at Magni Finance, says there was a flood of demand after HSBC announced its move yesterday (which is why HSBC ended up pulling deals even earlier than planned): Unsurprisingly, everyone has tried logging into the system following the announcement. I have been in a queue for a long time and, once I got past the initial wait, I have had several errors/issues. It is very unfair on clients and brokers with the short notice being given. We have had the same issues before with HSBC when they gave less than a day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notice. Katy Eatenton, mortgage &amp; protection specialist at Lifetime Wealth Management, fears other lenders could follow HSBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead: HSBC is another lender making changes with little notice, making it nearly impossible for brokers to service clients properly. And then to add insult to injury, they pulled them with immediate effect at 3.50pm.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m praying other lenders don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow suit. We need to get an industry minimum notice period sooner rather than later, as the status quo simply doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work for consumers. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. The turbulence in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage market has escalated after HSBC temporarily withdrew all its loans with only a few hours\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 notice, last night. HSBC has removed all its residential and buy-to-let products for new customers, with deals becoming available again on Monday. Products and rates for existing customers were still available, though. An HSBC spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To ensure that we can stay within our operational capacity and meet our customer service commitments, we occasionally need to limit the amount of new business we can take each day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our broker products will be available again on Monday, June 12.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But deals are likely to return at higher rates on Monday. It is the first time that HSBC, which accounts for almost a quarter of the home loans market, has withdrawn from the mortgage market since the aftermath of September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disastrous mini-budget under Liz Truss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. HSBC originally set a 5pm deadline for securing new deals yesterday, but after experiencing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant demand\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, at 3.45pm it pulled all the remaining deals immediately, as George Nixon of The Times explains: Nationwide Building Society, the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest lender, has already pushed up borrowing costs too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c increasing its fixed-rate mortgage deals by up to 0.25 percentage points. Among Nationwide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changes, it said two, three and five-year fixed-rate deals for people with a 5% deposit will increase by between 0.01 and 0.20 percentage points, with rates starting from 4.69%. Both lenders acted following the rapid rise in mortgage rates over the past few weeks. Those moves are being driven by concerns that the Bank of England will continue to raise interest rates, after UK inflation remained stubbornly high in April. Hundreds more home loan deals have been pulled by banks and building societies over the last week, while rates on new fixed mortgage deals are continuing to rise. Also coming up today Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s windfall tax on oil and gas producers is being scaled back, the government has just announced, as it tries to boost investment in the North Sea. Currently 75%, the levy will be cut to 40% if prices consistently return to normal levels for a sustained period, but still remain in place until 2028.

The country only operates 18 bilateral embassies in foreign capitals, and said in a statement: This is not an easy decision as Iceland has enjoyed rich relations with the people of Russia since our independence in 1944. However, the current situation simply does not make it viable for the small foreign service of Iceland to operate an embassy in Russia. I hope that conditions will someday allow for us to have normal and fruitful relations with Russia, but that depends on decisions taken by the Kremlin. Iceland stated it that it had accordingly asked Russia to lower the level of diplomatic representation at its embassy in Reykjav\u00c3\u00adk. The move has been welcomed by Ukraine. Foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted to say: Russia must see that barbarism leads to complete isolation. I encourage other states to follow Iceland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s example. Here are some images from the wires of debris from flooded houses that has been washing up along beaches in Odesa, more than 145km (90 miles) away from the Kakhovka dam, which was breached earlier this week. Reuters has a quick snap that Belgium will supply Ukraine with 105mm artillery rounds worth \u00e2\u201a\u00ac32.4m (\u00c2\u00a327.8m/$35m), citing a spokesperson for Belgium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence ministry. Here is a little bit more from Julian Borger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report on claims that seismic data backs up the theory that the Kakhovka dam was deliberately blown up, rather than simply collapsed. He writes: Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration that Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account of the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destruction, that it was blown up from inside by Russian forces, has not so far been confirmed by US, UK or other intelligence agencies. Ihor Syrota, the director general of the Ukrainian hydroelectric power company Ukrhydroenergo, dismissed suggestions the dam could have been destroyed as result of Ukrainian shelling or catastrophic structural failure as Russian propaganda. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The plant was designed to withstand a nuclear strike,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Syrota told the Guardian in an interview in Kyiv. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To destroy the plant from the outside, at least three aircraft bombs, each of 500kg, would have had to be dropped on the same spot. The station was blown up from the inside.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They brought hundreds of kilograms of explosives there. Ukraine reported last year that the station was mined. The Russians were just waiting for the right day to blow it up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Read more here: Seismic data adds to evidence that Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kakhovka dam was blown up The main centre of fighting is still in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s east, Kyiv said on Friday, as clashes in the south have prompted speculation that Ukrainian forces could have launched a long-awaited offensive. The Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar wrote on Telegram: The situation is tense in all areas of the frontline. The east is the epicentre. The enemy continues to concentrate its main efforts on the Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Maryinka directions. The deputy minister gave few details on the situation in southern Ukraine. Moscow says fighting has intensified since Thursday in the Zaporizhzhia region, particularly around the small town of Orikhiv, AFP reports. Russia will start deploying tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus after the facilities are ready on 7-8 July, President Vladimir Putin told his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko on Friday in a meeting in Sochi, Russia. According to a readout from the Kremlin, Putin said: So everything is according to plan, everything is stable. The two leaders had previously agreed the plan to deploy Russian land-based short-range nuclear missiles on the territory of Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close ally, where they will remain under Russian command. A junior nurse and a plumber were killed in Russian shelling of a hospital in Huliai Pole in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Zaporizhzhia region, a senior Ukrainian official said on Friday. Andriy Yermak, the head of the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, said on the Telegram messaging app under a photo of a devastated building that two others were wounded in Huliai Pole, a small town close to the frontline in southern Ukraine. These claims have not been independently verified. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has told the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Friday that Japan will offer emergency humanitarian aid worth about $5m (\u00c2\u00a33.9m) after the bursting of the Nova Kakhovka dam, a Japanese government spokesperson has said. Kishida also told Zelenskiy that Japan was ready to host a conference on Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reconstruction early next year, according to the official website of the Ukrainian president. The Japanese chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, told a regular news conference after the phone talks: Many Ukrainian citizens fell victim to the long-running Russian invasion, and civilian facilities including power plants were damaged. This can never be justified, and we strongly condemn this anew. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign ministry said on Friday that it had summoned the Japanese ambassador over Tokyo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to supply military equipment to Ukraine. Japan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which has backed Western sanctions against its longtime antagonist in east Asia in response to Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military campaign in Ukraine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c last month promised Ukraine about 100 military-use vehicles \u00e2\u20ac\u0153such as trucks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, having previously given protective equipment such as helmets and bullet-proof vests. However, Moscow said Tokyo was supplying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153armoured vehicles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as well as all-terrain vehicles. The ministry said in a statement: The Japanese side was told that this step would lead to an escalation of hostilities and a further increase in the number of human casualties of the Kyiv regime. Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, says there is growing evidence that the Nova Kakhovka dam was blown up. Evidence is growing that the Nova Kakhovka dam was blown up, after the publication of seismic data showing there was a blast at the site in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Norsar, the Norwegian Seismic Array, said signals from a regional station in Romania pointed to an explosion at 2.54am. Norsar did not draw conclusions on who was responsible. The Ukrainian government has said Russian occupying forces had control of the hydroelectric infrastructure on top of the dam and were using it as a garrison at the time of the blast. Explosive experts have said it would be much easier to blow up the dam from within than by firing on it from a distance. Read more here. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Friday that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everything indicates\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Russia was behind the Kakhovka dam breach, which Moscow and Kyiv have accused each other of causing. The dam was destroyed on Tuesday, forcing thousands to flee their homes as water surged into the Dnipro River, flooding dozens of villages and parts of the city of Kherson and sparking fears of a humanitarian disaster. Borrell told Spanish public television: The dam was not bombed. It was destroyed by explosives installed in the areas where the turbines are located. This area is under Russian control. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there to find out who did it. But everything seems to indicate that if it took place in an area under Russian control, it is difficult to believe it could have been someone else. In any case, the consequences for Ukraine are terrible, from the humanitarian point of view for the displaced people, and from the environmental point of view because the [dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] destruction will cause an ecological disaster. Eight people are dead in Russian-held territory and more than 5,800 have been evacuated from their homes as a result of the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, a senior Russian-appointed official said on Friday. Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-appointed head of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kherson province, which Russia claims to have unilaterally annexed, accused Ukraine of continuing to shell rescuers on the Russian-controlled left bank of the Dnipro River, Reuters reports. In a post on Telegram, Saldo said the water level in the urban district of Nova Kakhovka, the town adjacent to the dam on the downstream side, had dropped by 2.5 metres (8.2ft) from Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak. However, in Oleshky and Hola Prystan, opposite the Ukrainian-held city of Kherson at the mouth of the Dnipro, the water level remained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at the maximum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Saldo said the flooding may not abate for another 10 days, and that a total of 22,273 houses had been flooded in 17 towns and villages of the Russian-held part of Kherson. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 10.5% in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period a year ago, the economy ministry said on Friday. In a statement, the ministry said the fall was less than it had initially expected, indicating the economy was adapting to events even after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion more quickly than expected. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy shrank by about one-third last year after the full-scale Russian invasion. Yulia Svyrydenko, who serves as first deputy prime minister and economy minister, said: The data indicate that the Ukrainian economy is adapting and recovering at a faster pace than was previously forecast. She said the government continued to focus on stabilising the situation in the energy sector and helping solve logistics problems for Ukrainian exports, Reuters reports. The ministry said it had initially expected GDP to fall by 14.1% in the first quarter of 2023. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic security agency said on Friday it had intercepted a telephone call proving Russian forces blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and dam in Kherson region. It posted a 90-second audio clip of the alleged conversation on its Telegram channel. Reuters reported that the agency did not offer further details of the conversation or its participants. It said it had opened a criminal investigation into war crimes and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcecocide\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. You can listen to the recording, which has English subtitles, below: The Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has accused Russia of causing the collapse of the Kakhovka dam in Ukraine, calling it an act of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ecocide\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The burst of the dam, under Russian control in southern Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kherson region, unleashed large floods, forcing thousands of people to flee and wreaking environmental havoc. Russia and Ukraine have blamed one another for its destruction. Thunberg said on Twitter on Thursday: This ecocide as a continuation of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine is yet another atrocity which leaves the world lost for words. Our eyes are once again on Russia who must be held accountable for their crimes. Thunberg on Friday told Reuters during a weekly climate protest by the Swedish parliament that the aftermath of the dam burst was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely horrifying and awful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She said: Russia needs to be held accountable for their action and for their crimes. The eyes of the world are on them now. The Ukrainian interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, said on Friday four people had died and 13 were missing as a result of flooding in the southern region of Kherson following the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Klymenko said on the Telegram messaging app that a total of 2,412 people had been evacuated. These claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic security service (SBU) said earlier on Friday it had intercepted a telephone call proving a Russian \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sabotage group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and dam in southern Ukraine. A one-and-a-half minute audio clip on its Telegram channel of the alleged conversation featured two unidentified men who appeared to be discussing the fallout from the disaster in Russian. One of the men said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our saboteur group is there. They wanted to cause fear with this dam. It did not go according to the plan. More than they planned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Kremlin on Friday accused Ukrainian forces of killing civilian victims of flooding caused by the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine in repeated shelling attacks, including one pregnant woman. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the purported attacks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barbaric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Russia did not provide any evidence to back up its claims. Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on Friday that Crimea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water supply will not be affected by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, and the peninsula had enough water reserves for 500 days. A canal from the destroyed reservoir fed drinking water to the peninsula. Kyiv cut access to the canal in 2014, after Russia illegally seized Crimea and claimed to annex it. Vitalii Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region, has posted to Telegram to say that for two hours there has been no rise in the level of the Inhulets River, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accordingly, there is no water rise throughout the region\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has told Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Japan is ready to offer emergency humanitarian aid in the wake of the dam explosion and flooding, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief cabinet secretary said. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interior ministry said one person had been killed, three were wounded, and four buildings were destroyed from falling debris after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attack. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military shot down four cruise missiles and 10 attack drones during a Russian air strike overnight, the air force said in a statement. It said Russian forces had launched 16 drones and six cruise missiles during the attack, and that two other cruise missiles had struck a civilian object in central Ukraine. Zelenskiy on Thursday hailed what he described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in heavy fighting in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is very heavy fighting in Donetsk region,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy said in his daily video message, delivered in a train after visiting areas affected by the breach of the Kakhovka power dam. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there are results and I am grateful to those who achieved these results. Well done in Bakhmut. Step by step,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. On Friday, deputy defence minister Hannah Maliar said Ukrainian troops were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conducting active combat operations in several areas of the Bakhmut direction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that Russian troops were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conducting defensive operations in the Zaporizhzhia direction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positional battles continue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army on Friday reported heavy fighting in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, saying more than 21 Ukrainian tanks had been destroyed in battles across key sections of the frontline. A spokesperson for Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vostok group of forces said 13 Ukrainian tanks were destroyed in battles in the Zaporizhzhia region and eight in the Donetsk region. It reported artillery, drone and infantry battles. The claims have not been independently verified. Evgeny Balitsky, the Russian-imposed acting governor of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, has announced the formation of a people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s militia. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has reported that a 33-year-old man was wounded when \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shahed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drones struck an infrastructure object in Bohodukhiv. Voronezh regional governor Alexander Gusev has said three people were wounded in an attack on the southern Russian city of Voronezh when a drone hit a residential building. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has said it has fended off an aerial attack on the city of Belgorod, with air defence taking out two targets. Sweden will allow Nato to base troops on its territory even before it formally joins the defence alliance, the prime minister and defence minister said on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government has decided that the Swedish armed forces may undertake preparations with Nato and Nato countries to enable future joint operations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and the defence minister, P\u00c3\u00a5l Jonson, said. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Mabel Banfield-Nwachi will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has given a situational update on Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military operations via her Telegram account, saying that Russia continues to be on the defensive in the Zaporizhzhia region. She posted to say: East is the epicentre: the enemy continues to focus its main efforts on the Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Maryinka directions, heavy fighting continues. In all directions, the enemy carries out airstrikes and carries out artillery and mortar attacks. However, the enemy does not succeed in achieving his goals. Our defenders repel attacks. In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is withdrawing reserves and trying to hold the occupied positions. Makes attempts to attack, but fails. Now our defenders are conducting active combat operations in several areas of the Bakhmut direction. South: the enemy is conducting defensive operations in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Positional battles continue. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has praised the state emergency services working in the flooded areas of Kherson. In a message on Twitter, the Ukrainian president said: We are working at all levels of state and local authorities to rescue as many people as possible from the flooded areas. The evacuation is ongoing. Wherever we can get people out of the flood zone, we do so. The State Emergency Service, police and military are doing a great job! I want to thank each and every person involved! We are establishing more details about the damage Russia has caused by this disaster. In more than 40 settlements, life is broken. For hundreds of thousands of people in many towns and villages, access to drinking water has been greatly hampered. Russia must be held accountable for this deliberate crime against people, nature and life itself. Here are some images that have been sent to us from inside Russian-occupied Kherson over the news wires. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region in Russia, has said it has fended off an aerial attack on the city of Belgorod. He posted on Telegram to say: Our air defence system worked over Belgorod. Shot down two air targets on approach to the city. Operational services clarify the consequences on the ground. According to preliminary data, no victims. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has given a readout of his conversation with Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Fumio Kishida. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president tweeted: I spoke about the consequences of Russia blowing up the Kakhovka HPP. This is a deliberate act of terrorism and another war crime of Russia, which, in particular, threatens the safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP. I also told about the situation on the frontline and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another intensification of missile terror against civilian infrastructure and peaceful cities. We discussed further involvement of Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security support, particularly in the area of humanitarian demining, and steps to implement the Ukrainian Peace Formula and prepare for the Global Peace Summit. I am grateful for the readiness to hold a conference on the recovery of Ukraine early next year. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic security service (SBU) said earlier on Friday it had intercepted a telephone call proving a Russian \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sabotage group\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and dam in southern Ukraine. A one-and-a-half minute audio clip on its Telegram channel of the alleged conversation featured two unidentified men who appeared to be discussing the fallout from the disaster in Russian. In the conversation the first speaker starts by saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153News. Yesterday there was a video in the Telegram channel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a soldier was standing there, his face covered, in his uniform. And he says there is no flooding, that people are living normally. And behind him there is a window and you can see knee-deep water.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The second speaker says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funny. Is it about the fact that the hydroelectric power plant was destroyed?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The conversation continued: Speaker one: Yeah. The main problem is that the hydropower plant cools their nuclear reactor. Speaker two: That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine. They did it to themselves. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll blow up and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. Speaker one: So our guys did it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not them, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ours. Speaker two: Really, it was ours? They said that the Khokhols [derogatory term for Ukrainians] blew it up. Speaker one: They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blow it up. Our saboteur group is there. They wanted to cause fear with this dam. It did not go according to the plan. More than they planned. Speaker two: Yeah, well, naturally. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gonna be like Chornobyl, right? Speaker one: Built in the 1950s. It went down fast, it went down. Reuters reports the SBU did not offer further details of the conversation or its participants. It said it had opened a criminal investigation into war crimes and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ecocide\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The invaders wanted to blackmail Ukraine by blowing up the dam and staged a man-made disaster in the south of our country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said in a statement. Russia and the officials it has imposed in occupied Ukraine have blamed Kyiv for destroying the dam but have offered no evidence, and varying conflicting explanations. The Kremlin on Friday accused Ukrainian forces of killing civilian victims of flooding caused by the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine in repeated shelling attacks, including one pregnant woman. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, called the purported attacks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barbaric\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Russia did not provide any evidence to back up its claims. Ukraine has repeatedly criticised Russia for shelling the Ukrainian-controlled portion of flooded Kherson while it was trying to undertake evacuations, with multiple videos posted online illustrating the claims, including from Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief rabbi. Voronezh regional governor Alexander Gusev has increased the number of people wounded in a drone attack on the Russian city to three. In a post to the Telegram messaging app, Gusev wrote: The room in the house on Belinsky Street in Voronezh which was hit by a drone today, was empty. No one was inside at the time of the incident. As I have already said, medical assistance was provided to three lightly injured, hospitalisation was not required. There are no dead. Gusev went on to say that a decision would be made about whether people from the building needed to be resettled due to the damage. The state news agency Tass reports it was told by authorities that the drone was targeting an aircraft plant in the region, but was downed by electronic warfare. The Russian deputy prime minister Marat Khusnullin said on Friday that Crimea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water supply would not be affected by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, the RIA news agency reported. Reuters cites the agency quoting him as saying that Crimea\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservoirs were full and that the peninsula had enough water reserves for 500 days. A canal from the reservoir fed drinking water to the peninsula. Kyiv cut access to the canal in 2014, after Russia illegally seized Crimea and claimed to annex it. Former Ukrainian minister and government adviser Anton Gerashchenko has published on social media a CCTV clip which purports to show the moment a grocery store in Uman was hit. The Guardian has not independently verified the location or when the video was shot. Earlier today my colleague Patrick Wintour offered this analysis of Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criticism of international aid agencies over their response to the flooding in Kherson: Zelenskiy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks reflect his anger that the UN \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and much international reporting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not yet rebutting Russian claims of innocence over the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destruction, or focusing on the Russian failure to help those on the occupied left bank to which the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says they have been denied access by Moscow. But his criticism is only his latest salvo in his savaging of the performance of the ICRC in Ukraine, as opposed to Red Cross Ukraine. Zelenskiy and his circle believe the Geneva-based organisation has used the cover of neutrality, international law and confidentiality to mask a moral weakness. Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian ombudsman for human rights, said last month that every day he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153faced with the fact that the Red Cross does not want to perform its functions. But worst of all, the Red Cross has a monopoly and does not allow other organisations to appear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One organisation uses its history, its name to get in the way of doing something impactful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lubinets added Ukraine wanted a second organisation to be established with co-responsibility for accessing political prisoners, arguing that competition may spur the ICRC to be more proactive. Read more of Patrick Wintour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis here: Zelenskiy steps up criticism of International Red Cross over inaction at Kakhovka dam Two people were wounded on Friday in an apparent drone strike in the southern Russian city of Voronezh, Reuters reports regional governor Alexander Gusev said. Voronezh is about 180km (110 miles) from the Ukrainian border, and borders Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kursk and Belgorod regions, both of which have been frequently subject to cross-border shelling from Ukraine. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s domestic security service said on Friday it had intercepted a telephone call proving Russian forces blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric station and dam in southern Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kherson region. The security service of Ukraine posted a one-and-a-half minute audio clip of the alleged conversation on its Telegram channel. More details soon \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Speaking of Nato, the secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has tweeted that he hopes to welcome Sweden as a full member of the alliance \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as soon as possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sweden will allow Nato to base troops on its territory even before it formally joins the defence alliance, the prime minister and defence minister said on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government has decided that the Swedish armed forces may undertake preparations with Nato and Nato countries to enable future joint operations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, and the defence minister, P\u00c3\u00a5l Jonson, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The preparations may consist of temporary basing of foreign equipment and personnel on Swedish territory. The decision sends a clear signal to Russia and strengthens Sweden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters reports they said in an opinion piece in the daily Dagens Nyheter. Sweden applied last year to join Nato as a result of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine. Objections from Turkey and Hungary have delayed the bid and Sweden now hopes to join by a Nato summit in Lithuania next month. Volodymyr Zelenskiy is expected to join the summit in person. Here are some of the latest images to be sent to us from Ukraine over the news wires. The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, has told Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Japan is ready to offer emergency humanitarian aid in the wake of the dam explosion and flooding, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Friday. Reuters reports he added the aid would be worth about $5m (\u00c2\u00a34m/\u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.6m) and distributed via international organisations. Suspilne, Ukraine's state broadcaster, reports that an explosion has been heard in Kharkiv, stating it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably outside the city limits\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s army on Friday reported heavy fighting in the Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine, saying more than 21 Ukrainian tanks had been destroyed in battles across key sections of the frontline. Reuters reports a spokesperson for Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vostok group of forces said 13 Ukrainian tanks were destroyed in battles in the Zaporizhzhia region and eight in the Donetsk region. It reported artillery, drone and infantry battles. The claims have not been independently verified. Evgeny Balitsky, the Russian-imposed acting governor of the occupied Zaporizhzhia region, has announced the formation of a people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s militia. In a post on Telegram, Balitsky said: In the Zaporizhzhia region, a people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s militia has been created, which, together with the police and the military commandant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, will take over patrolling and law enforcement in the settlements of the Zaporizhzhia region. Today, the first militias took the oath of allegiance to the Zaporizhzhia region and the inhabitants of our region. I am confident in the openness of the hearts of our countrymen, their steadfastness and desire to help. Vitalii Kim, governor of the Mykolaiv region, has posted to Telegram to say that for two hours there has been no rise in the level of the Inhulets River, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accordingly, there is no water rise throughout the region\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Inhulets flows into the Dnipro, and waters had been rising after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. Russian military bloggers are saying that overnight the Ukrainians were making another attempt to break through Russian lines in occupied Zaporizhzhia in the area of Orikhiv. The claims have not been independently verified. Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, has reported that a 33-year-old man was wounded when \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shahed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd drones struck an infrastructure object in Bohodukhiv. Suspilne, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state broadcaster, reports that during the night the flood water in Kherson fell by 20cm, citing the head of the regional authority, Oleksandr Prokudin. It claimed that 2,352 people and 550 animals had been evacuated from flooded areas. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog in London. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interior ministry said one person had been killed, three were wounded, and four buildings were destroyed from falling debris after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest attack. Reuters reports it posted images on the Telegram messaging app of firefighters attending to the smouldering wreckage of what appeared to be residential homes. The air force also said two cruise missiles had struck a civilian object in the central Ukrainian region of Cherkasy during an earlier attack on Thursday evening. The regional governor, Ihor Taburets, said at least eight people had been wounded in that strike, which he said hit a carwash and an industrial object. The Ukrainian military earlier reported shooting down four out of six missiles launched during the attack, which the air force said lasted around six hours, and 10 out of 16 drones. Bloomberg reports, citing administration officials, that the US will announce a new arms package for Ukraine valued at more than $2bn as soon as Friday. The funds under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative will be heavy on air defence munitions and will help Ukraine purchase Hawk missile launchers and two types of advanced Patriot air defence missiles, the report said. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military shot down four cruise missiles and 10 attack drones during a Russian air strike overnight, the air force said in a statement early on Friday. It said Russian forces had launched 16 drones and six cruise missiles during the attack, and that two other cruise missiles had struck a civilian object in central Ukraine during an earlier attack on Thursday evening. White in Washington, Sunak also made the case to Biden for the UK defence minister, Ben Wallace, to succeed outgoing Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who is set to end his term leading the 31-member alliance in September. Stoltenberg is slated to meet Biden in Washington on Monday, and leaders from the alliance are due to gather in Lithuania on 11-12 July for their annual summit. Asked if it was time for a UK leader for Nato, Biden said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it may be\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that remains to be seen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have to get a consensus within Nato,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. US president Joe Biden and British prime minister Rishi Sunak reiterated their commitment to help Ukraine repel Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing invasion after talks at the White House, the Associated Press reports. The US and UK are the two biggest donors to the Ukraine war effort and play a central role in a long-term effort announced last month to train, and eventually equip, Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. Biden reiterated confidence that Congress would continue to provide Ukraine funding as needed despite some hesitation among Republican leaders at the growing cost of the war for American taxpayers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US and the UK have stood together to support Ukraine,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Biden said at the start of their meeting. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Thursday hailed what he described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in heavy fighting in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is very heavy fighting in Donetsk region,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy said in his daily video message, delivered in a train after visiting areas affected by the breach of the Kakhovka power dam. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there are results and I am grateful to those who achieved these results. Well done in Bakhmut. Step by step,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Zelenskiy referred to other areas where fighting is going on, but said he would provide no details. Pictures posted on his Telegram account showed him meeting some of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top generals in the field. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Sullivan. Our top story this morning: heavy fighting in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is very heavy fighting in Donetsk region,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy said in his daily video message, delivered in a train after visiting areas affected by the breach of the Kakhovka power dam. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there are results and I am grateful to those who achieved these results. Well done in Bakhmut. Step by step,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. And US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reiterated their commitment to help Ukraine repel Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing invasion on Thursday, as Sunak visited the US. Elsewhere: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been affected by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president said the main issues discussed during the visit were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organisation of life support for the flooded areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Zelenskiy later hailed what he described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in heavy fighting in Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is very heavy fighting in Donetsk region,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy said in his daily video message, delivered in a train after visiting areas affected by the breach of the Kakhovka power dam. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there are results and I am grateful to those who achieved these results. Well done in Bakhmut. Step by step,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. A substantial Ukrainian force was pushing an assault against Russian positions in the south on Thursday, in an intensification of fighting that some Ukrainian officials and western analysts said marked the start in earnest of Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much-vaunted counteroffensive. The combat against Russian positions south of Zaporizhzhia included western-supplied tanks and armoured vehicles and infantry backed by artillery. There were reports of intense fighting outside the town of Tokmak, a key Russian logistical hub. Russia on Thursday denied Ukrainian accusations that it backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and discriminates against ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, accusing Kyiv of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blatant lies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top court. One of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest-serving and most respected human rights campaigners Oleg Orlov went on trial on Thursday, facing the prospect of three years in jail if convicted of repeatedly discrediting Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armed forces, his organisation said. The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. The UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atomic watchdog later said that the plant has months worth of water reserves that can be pumped to the power plant to cool reactors and other areas. The World Health Organization has rushed emergency supplies to flood-hit parts of Ukraine and is preparing to respond to an array of health risks including trauma, drowning and waterborne diseases such as cholera, officials said on Thursday. Ukraine could lose several million tonnes of crops because of flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Thursday. Russian shelling killed a civilian in the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prosecutor general claimed. Police reported that an additional three people were injured. The investigations team of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has released a new video in which it claims to have found a son of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, whose name was previously not known to the public. Over the past year, Shoigu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged son has been making cheesy pop songs in English while his father is sending tens of thousands of Russians to war in Ukraine, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shaun Walker reported. Two missiles hit sites near the city of Uman in central Ukraine on Thursday, injuring eight people, the regional governor said. Ihor Taburets, governor of Cherkasy region, wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the missiles hit an industrial site and a car wash in the evening. He said two of the injured were seriously hurt, according to preliminary information. The Russian embassy has said the responsibility for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfolding tragedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Kherson due to the destruction of the Kakhovka dam lies with Kyiv and western countries who have supplied Ukraine with weapons, in what they describe as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrorist plot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a statement. Britain announced a new sanctions package against Belarus on Thursday for its role in facilitating Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine, including import bans and new measures aimed at preventing internet propaganda. About 230 sq miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jun/09/donald-trump-republicans-rally-ex-us-president-indictment-2024-race-politics-live-updates", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Donald Trump indictment: ex-president bragged on tape about keeping \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsecret\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 military file, reports say \u00e2\u20ac\u201c live", "lead": "CNN reports audio recording of Trump talking about classified document; Trump rivals for Republican nomination defend him against indictment", "author": "Chris Stein", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T13:22:12Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896544", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc5c47ce869935fe17cd7939cf02987e7a5f364/0_135_4467_2680/500.jpg", "body": "Now that Donald Trump has been indicted, what happens next? The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joan E Greve has the answer: Donald Trump is preparing for his second arraignment in two months after learning that he would face seven federal charges in connection to his mishandling of classified documents. Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm, although the exact charges he will face are still unclear as the seven-count indictment remains under seal. On Fox News Digital on Thursday night he said he would plead not guilty. After news of the indictment broke, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies rallied to his defense as the US braced for the unprecedented spectacle of a former president forced to defend himself against federal criminal charges. Fresh off the news that Donald Trump is being indicted on several felonies related to possessing classified government documents, CNN reports this morning that an audio recording has emerged of him bragging about keeping a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd military document that had not been declassified. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As president, I could have declassified, but now I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump says, according to a transcript of the recording that CNN obtained. The network reports that the audio recording captures the sound of paper rustling, indicating that Trump may have actually been waving the document around as he was talking about it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump says in the transcript. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was done by the military and given to me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prosecutors have this recording, CNN says. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more from their story: Former President Donald Trump acknowledged on tape in a 2021 meeting that he had retained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secret\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd military information that he had not declassified, according to a transcript of the audio recording obtained by CNN. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As president, I could have declassified, but now I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump says, according to the transcript. CNN obtained the transcript of a portion of the meeting where Trump is discussing a classified Pentagon document about attacking Iran. In the audio recording, which CNN previously reported was obtained by prosecutors, Trump says that he did not declassify the document he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referencing, according to the transcript. Trump was indicted Thursday on seven counts in special counsel Jack Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into the mishandling of classified documents. Details from the indictment have not been made public, so it unknown whether any of the seven counts refer to the recorded 2021 meeting. Still, the tape is significant because it shows that Trump had an understanding the records he had with him at Mar-a-Lago after he left the White House remained classified. Publicly, Trump has claimed that all the documents he brought with him to his Florida residence are declassified, while he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s railed against the special counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation as a political witch hunt attempting to interfere with his 2024 presidential campaign. CNN first reported last week that prosecutors had obtained the audio recording of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2021 meeting at his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort, with two people working on the autobiography of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former chief of staff Mark Meadows as well as aides employed by the former president, including communications specialist Margo Martin. The transcript of the audio recording suggests that Trump is showing the document he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discussing to those in the room. Several sources have told CNN the recording captures the sound of paper rustling, as if Trump was waving the document around, though is not clear if it was the actual Iran document. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump says at one point, according to the transcript. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was done by the military and given to me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, US politics blog readers. Donald Trump is making history again, and not in a good way. Yesterday evening, he announced that he would soon be indicted on federal charges related to the classified documents discovered at his Mar-a-Lago resort last year, the first time in US history a former president has faced such allegations. While the justice department has yet to confirm the charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith, who was appointed late last year to investigate the secret materials matter along with Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement in the January 6 insurrection and the overall effort to prevent Joe Biden from taking office, the news has become yet another rallying cry for Republicans \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opponents for the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2024 presidential nomination. Florida governor Ron DeSantis vowed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bring accountability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the justice department, while senator Tim Scott lamented \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a justice system where the scales are weighted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. GOP politicians have generally flocked to defend Trump whenever he faces legal trouble, such as when the Manhattan district attorney separately indicted him in March, and today is no different. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep you posted on this developing story. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what else is going on today: Joe Biden has a long day of travel in North Carolina, which will give the traveling press corps plenty of opportunities to ask him what he thinks of the charges against Trump. Principal deputy White House press secretary Olivia Dalton will brief reporters around 10.30am eastern time, and you can bet that she, too, will be asked about the indictment. Matt Gaetz, a prominent Trump ally in the House of Representatives, is the subject of a new investigation by the chamber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ethics committee, Punchbowl News reports. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear what matter they are looking into, but earlier this year, Gaetz said the justice department ended a sex trafficking inquiry into him without charges."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/macron-visit-annecy-knife-attack-victims-two-children-still-critical-condition", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Macron visits Annecy knife attack victims as two children remain critical", "lead": "French president and wife also due to meet \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbackpack hero\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detention extended after psychiatric evaluation", "author": "Jon Henley", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T13:17:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896547", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d45edd011c7f5f325fca9863ce0788fa10e1c7f7/0_231_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, have visited preschool children and an elderly man who were badly wounded in a knife attack in the French Alps, as the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detention was extended after a psychiatric examination on Friday. Four toddlers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one aged 22 months, two aged two and one aged three \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as two men aged 70 and 78 were injured in the stabbing, which happened on Thursday morning in a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playground in the popular lakeside town of Annecy. Macron and his wife, who the Elys\u00c3\u00a9e Palace said wanted to visit not just the victims but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153everyone who has contributed in helping and supporting them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, visited three of the children and their families in hospital in Grenoble. The couple later travelled to Annecy where they sat at the bedside of one of the injured men, who was being treated for multiple stab wounds and an injury from a stray police bullet fired during the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest. They were also due to meet a young Catholic student, Henri D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Anselme, who has been named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the backpack hero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by French media after he came face to face with the assailant and used his rucksack as a shield to try to block him. A fourth child was being treated in a Swiss hospital in Geneva. All had been operated on and two remained in a critical but stable condition a day after the attack, the prime minister, \u00c3\u2030lisabeth Borne, said on Friday. Officials said the other children, and the two adult victims, had less serious injuries, although there were conflicting reports on their condition. One of the children injured in the attack is British and another has Dutch nationality. The motive for the attack remains unclear. The regional prosecutor, Line Bonnet-Mathis, said the detention of the alleged attacker, named as Abdalmasih H, had been extended on Friday after a psychiatric examination. Police had not yet been able to interview the suspect, a 31-year-old Syrian national who has refugee status in Sweden and is being investigated for attempted murder, because of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153agitated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd condition, French media reported. Bonnet-Mathis said there was no obvious terrorist motive and other officials told reporters that the suspect had not been under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack, at about 9.45am local time on Thursday. Borne said the alleged attacker had not been known to any intelligence service and did not have any history of psychiatric problems. She said he was homeless and an isolated individual. The rampage has intensified tensions in France over immigration, with rightwing politicians seizing on the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s origins. An impromptu shrine emerged overnight at the park, with local people placing candles, flowers and messages. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not prepared for these kinds of events,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said one Annecy resident, L\u00c3\u00a9o Ganassali, 21, as he laid flowers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I came as a child to play in this park and to see it in mourning is very, very tough,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told Agence France-Presse. Authorities said the suspect had spent 10 years in Sweden and recently divorced from his Swedish wife. He had also sought asylum in Switzerland, Italy and France, where his application had been rejected on Sunday because of his status in Sweden. Prosecutors said he entered France legally in November 2022. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He called me around four months ago. He was living in a church,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd his ex-wife said, adding that he had left Sweden because he had been unable to get Swedish nationality. The alleged attacker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, who lives in the US, said she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in a state of shock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The French interior minister, G\u00c3\u00a9rald Darmanin, said it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153troubling coincidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the stabbings followed the rejection of the suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s French asylum application. Video footage of the attack, taken by a bystander and verified by multiple news organisations, showed the attacker, dressed in black and carrying a blade about 10cm long, jumping over a low wall into a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playground. The suspect, who reportedly declared himself a Syrian Christian in his French asylum application, could be heard shouting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the name of Jesus Christ\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before he lunged at a young child in a stroller, pushing aside a woman who tried to fend him off. French media reported that the alleged attacker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental health was cause for concern. BFM TV quoted unnamed sources as saying the suspect had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incoherent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since his arrest and had rolled on the floor several times. A mass was to be held in Annecy Cathedral in tribute to the victims and their families later on Friday, church authorities said. The attack spurred fresh debate of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immigration and asylum policy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It seems like the culprit has the same profile that you see often in these attacks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said \u00c3\u2030ric Ciotti, the head of the rightwing Republicans party. Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Rally said France should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153regain sovereignty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on immigration.

She is very sweet but a complete chatterbox. When we meet, she talks nonstop, usually about herself. We are both women in our early 30s and have been friends since secondary school. It is only in the last few years that I have noticed our conversations are really her monologues. She rarely asks me questions or shows much interest in what I am up to. Things I have tried include: jumping in to say something rather than waiting to be asked (in which case, she nods and listens politely, then gets back to whatever she was banging on about before I spoke), and continuing to talk whenever she starts to talk over me (I used to just fall silent and let her take the floor). I have to say, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153V, let me finish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153V, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my time to speak now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (her husband has to do the same). In recent times I have started to engage less/ask her fewer questions, but she does not seem to notice. If this all sounds like a teacher and a child, that is also how it feels to me and I would prefer not to be in this role. Is there anything else you can recommend? She has a very gentle nature and I do not want to snap at her or hurt her feelings. But I need guidance because I feel like her audience rather than her friend. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve put it very eloquently and that sounds quite tough. I know some people who are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuck on transmit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Not being listened to is exhausting and invalidating, and after a while one-sided conversations make you feel like you could be just anyone, sat there. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly make you feel special. I consulted BACP registered psychotherapist Armele Philpotts. Philpotts wondered if something had caused V\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153social needs not to be currently met.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some people talk more when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re anxious and it becomes a vicious cycle. Or, maybe your gradual noticing of the way she is, is an indication that the friendship isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t giving you what you need any more. V either doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how to listen, or doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to. Being a good, reflective, listener is a real skill and one few people have, but most people at least let the other person speak! Philpotts also wondered if this was how V\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family were: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known V since school you might know her parents. Is this a family way of doing things?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it easier but it may make it more understandable Given V\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s husband also has to adopt coping mechanisms I think, if you do want to continue the friendship, it may be time to act. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be snappy, although the longer this goes on and it winds you up, the more likely it is you will blurt out something less controlled. Philpotts suggested: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I really love it when you listen to me [people are more responsive if criticism is preceded by praise], but it seems like we have different rules about taking turns to talk?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Humour is another great way to deal with this, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to do if a situation has gone on for so long that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wound up. Humour needs to come from a place of levity. I have some friends who are not great listeners a lot of the time, but great friends in other ways. If I need them to listen I say at the beginning of the conversation, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I really just need you to listen to me for a bit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That often works, if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made it very clear from the outset. People shifting the conversation on to them, however, is harder to deal with. Sometimes this shifting is born out of them wanting show you they understand or that they are like you (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that also happened to me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd thing), but if the topic then doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shift back to you, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very annoying. For me, the worse offenders are people who never ask questions of others; in my experience, it shows they are not only not interested in others, but by definition not that interesting either. Have you tried doing activities with her? A good, brisk walk may not enable her to talk quite as much. But sad though it is, it would be perfectly reasonable and understandable if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve started to move apart. We all evolve, and sometimes our friends grow with us, sometimes they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Friends made at school can be lifelong, but you can go through stages of having not that much in common, or needing different things; sometimes you find each other again further down the line. Sometimes you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. V sounds sweet, but if the friendship isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK to put it on pause for a while.

Safety concerns are mounting after breakthroughs in generative AI, which can produce convincing text, images and even voice on command, with tech executives such as Elon Musk among the figures expressing alarm. Here is a look at what the summit might achieve. What is the aim of the summit? The prime minister has changed his tone on AI in recent weeks. Having been overwhelmingly optimistic about the opportunities it creates, he has begun to talk about its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153existential risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sunak is trying to position the UK as the natural hub for efforts to regulate the industry on a global scale, one that can provide a bridge between the US and China, and to offer an alternative to what some consider to be the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy-handed approach. Described as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first major global summit on AI safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the government says it will consider the risks the technology poses and discuss how they can be mitigated through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internationally coordinated action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Is internationally coordinated action needed? Industry professionals harbour concerns about AI and have issued warnings about the dangers it poses. Elon Musk was one of more than 50,000 signatories to a letter in March that called for an immediate pause in the development of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153giant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd AIs, alongside the creation of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153robust AI governance systems\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Concern about a possible existential threat from a system that human intervention cannot control by human intervention is not universal though. Many in the tech industry argue that the focus should be more immediate, for instance by focusing on the potential for generative AI, which can provide plausible imitations of text, images and voice that could produce destabilising disinformation during elections. What would a global framework look like? The UN-brokered treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, which came into force in 1970, is an example of a global attempt to mitigate an existential threat. The treaty, to which 191 states are signatories, commits those that have nuclear weapon states to not helping those who do not acquire or build them. The International Atomic Energy Agency oversees compliance through inspections. The treaty also promotes the spread of peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The letter calling for a six-month pause in AI development offers an insight into what might go into such a framework. It calls for dedicated regulatory authorities, public funding for safety research, and oversight and tracking of powerful systems. Would a nuclear arms-style framework succeed with AI? As with nuclear weapons, the technology that such a framework would seek to contain is already out there and proliferating. The chatbot phenomenon ChatGPT reached 100 million users within two months of its launch and a now-famous fake image of the pope wearing a Balenciaga jacket has underlined the power of generative AI to deceive. One of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s engineers warned last month that the company could lose out to open-source AI technology. Such developers release their work for anyone to use, improve or adapt as they see fit, making it difficult for a framework to curb the use of open-source models. China is likely to be excluded from the UK summit, which will be open to technology companies and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like-minded countries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This indicates that an international framework to place guardrails around AI development will not have the participation of a global tech and AI powerhouse. What is happening in AI regulation already? The EU has made significant strides in the area and is proposing legislation that will be seen a pacesetter for AI regulation, confirming the bloc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status as a leading tech regulator. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AI white paper sets out a set of principles to which the industry should adhere, but offers little in the way of concrete rules to govern it. Ministers disappointed some experts by resisting the idea of creating a new regulator to focus exclusively on AI. The G7 has agreed to create an intergovernmental forum called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hiroshima AI process\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to debate issues around fast-growing tools."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/09/donald-trump-indictment-republican-support", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Republicans rally behind Donald Trump after classified documents indictment", "lead": "Senior party figures and Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closest challenger in the GOP presidential race, Ron DeSantis, make supportive statements", "author": "Martin Pengelly in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T12:49:17Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896558", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e129b77774c6d318f27d21ccb177d018ef334ba7/0_0_4442_2666/500.jpg", "body": "Republicans, including some rivals for the 2024 presidential nomination, have rallied quickly to support Donald Trump, after news of the former US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictment on several federal counts relating to his retention of classified documents. The news was broken by Trump himself on his own social media platform Truth Social, seemingly pre-empting any announcement from the Department of Justice, and forcing many Republicans to flock to his defense. Kevin McCarthy, the House speaker, lamented \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a dark day for the United States of America\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is unconscionable for a president to indict the leading candidate opposing him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joe Biden did not indict Trump. The former president was indicted by Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by Merrick Garland, the US attorney general whom Biden nominated. After four years in which Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempts to influence the Department of Justice were widely reported, Biden has sought to safeguard department independence. Saying he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and every American who believes in the rule of law stand with President Trump against this grave injustice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, McCarthy promised to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hold this brazen weaponisation of power accountable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign fired out a list of supportive statements from senior party figures including McCarthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy, Steve Scalise, governors Jim Justice of West Virginia and Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas and a battery of US senators. On the far right of the party, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies were quick to his support. Jim Jordan of Ohio, chair of the House judiciary committee, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sad day for America. God Bless President Trump.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marjorie Taylor Greene, the powerful House extremist from Georgia, said Republicans needed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to stop fighting each other\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, so they could battle Democrats \u00e2\u20ac\u0153arresting their political enemies and [working] together in their corrupt ways to get it done\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Clay Higgins, from Louisiana, issued perhaps the most outlandish response with the conspiracy-laden language that has become common currency through much of the right of the party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a perimeter probe from the oppressors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hold. [Trump] has this. Buckle up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 know your bridges. Rock steady calm. That is all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd McCarthy also made reference to an investigation of classified material found at offices kept by Biden after leaving the vice-presidency in 2017. Another special counsel, Robert Hur, is at work. An investigation into records kept by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice-president, Mike Pence, closed this month. Pence is now a competitor to Trump in the Republican primary. Before news of the indictment, speaking in Iowa, Pence said it would prove \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely divisive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the US while sending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a terrible message to the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Trump faces unprecedented legal jeopardy, including state and federal indictments and a $5m civil penalty after being held liable for sexual abuse and defamation. Indictments also loom over his election subversion but he maintains huge leads in most polling averages when it comes to the Republican primary. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s closest challenger, Ron DeSantis, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weaponisation of federal law enforcement represents a mortal threat to a free society. We have for years witnessed an uneven application of the law depending upon political affiliation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rightwing Florida governor referred to Republican attempts to incriminate Biden in relation to alleged wrongdoing by his son, Hunter Biden, and his predecessor as the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Notably, DeSantis did not refer to Trump by name, instead saying he would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bring accountability to the DoJ, excise political bias and end weaponisation once and for all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Tim Scott, a US senator from South Carolina, also reached for a Republican talking point, lamenting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the weaponisation of the Department of Justice against the former president\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur and rank outsider, went harder: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be much easier for me to win this election if Trump weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the race, but I stand for principles over politics. I commit to pardon Trump promptly on 20 January 2025 and to restore the rule of law in our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Two challengers who have bucked party orthodoxy to attack Trump also commented on his indictment. The former New Jersey governor Chris Christie said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see what the facts are when any possible indictment is released. As I have said before, no one is above the law, no matter how much they wish they were.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asa Hutchinson, a former governor of Arkansas, made the most optimistic call. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While Donald Trump is entitled to the presumption of innocence, the ongoing criminal proceedings will be a major distraction. This reaffirms the need for Donald Trump to respect the office and end his campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/09/chess-fabiano-caruana-stavanger-magnus-carlsen-trails", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Chess: Fabiano Caruana closes in on Stavanger win as Magnus Carlsen trails", "lead": "The US champion and world No 2 leads before Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final round, while the top-ranked player is tied for sixth", "author": "Leonard Barden", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T12:37:04Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896561", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7b7506a63af9ef925aa234d7ba3a8fb34c2ca078/713_245_1169_701/500.jpg", "body": "\u00e2\u20ac\u0153You work for a long period of time and the results don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really show, but at some point everything just comes together and you start to play better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was how Fabiano Caruana described his performance in Stavanger this week. Caruana followed up his first round win against Magnus Carlsen by leading all the way, and he is still there at the start of Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final round. It has been something of a comeback. At his peak in 2014, Caruana achieved the highest ever tournament performance, rated at 3098, in the Sinquefield Cup, and he also reached his personal peak of 2851, the all-time third best after Carlsen and Garry Kasparov. In 2018, he tied his world championship match with Carlsen 6-6, drawing all 12 classical games before losing the speed tie-break. Caruana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rating again approached its peak in 2020, but then his results deteriorated, partly due to a sense that Carlsen was his superior and partly because of a split with his longstanding coach. His rating dipped below 2800, and he was in danger of dropping out of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 10. Carlsen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abdication of the world crown last year recharged Caruana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambition. The commentator Maurice Ashley described his colleague\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focus: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I know for a fact that for Fabi it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world champion or bust, especially now that Magnus has abdicated the throne. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thinking: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to show my stuff right now, particularly with all the young players coming up.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Time is ticking, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 30 now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The elephant in the room is the general perception among top players that China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ding Liren is a subpar world champion who will be vulnerable to his next challenger. In Norway, a critical game was in the fifth round, where Caruana met the teenage generation leader Alireza Firouzja, 19, in an encounter that would also determine the No 2 spot in the live ratings. Caruana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strengths are his opening prep and his accurate calculation skills, and his surprise choice of the French Defence 1 e4 e6 provoked his young rival into an over-optimistic approach. White\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major errors were 17 Nd6, gambitting two queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side pawns for nebulous compensation when 17 0-0 Qc4 would have been equal, and 25 Qh8+? (25 Rc1!), going after Black\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s h8 rook, allowed a long virtually forced sequence where Caruana emerged with bishop and five pawns for rook and an easily won ending, which Firouzja immediately resigned. Caruana still faces a first prize decider in Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final round against Hikaru Nakamura. The five-time US champion with over a million streamer followers briefly became world No 2 during the tournament, and has impressed with his pragmatic, tactically barbed playing style and his lightning fast reflexes when games go down to the wire. The time control in Stavanger is unforgiving, with two hours for the first 40 moves but no per-move increment, and then just 10 seconds a move from move 41 until the end of the game, while draws are replayed as Armageddon games. where White has more time but a draw on the board counts as a win for Black on the scoreboard. The net effect is that once you get into time pressure, you can never escape. Nakamura had deputies for his stream while he played the tournament, but in several games he used the confessional, where players can talk to the outside world while awaiting their opponent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next turn, to give a running commentary on his own game, and in one instance (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Welcome back, everyone!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) on the other games as well. Nakamura\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy is boundless. In Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seventh round after he and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov completed both their classical and Armageddon games in the time it took Carlsen and Firouzja to play their first few moves, he went on to take yet another first prize in Chess.com\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Titled Tuesday, which he has already won more than 50 times. Dommaraju Gukesh, who only turned 17 at the start of the tournament, was in third place with a round to go and has further enhanced his reputation. The teen is up to world No 13 in the live ratings, has risen to India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s No 2 behind the legendary Vishy Anand, and is coached by Anand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former trainer. Gukesh is already fearless and combative against the very top players. He defeated Firouzja in classical, beat Caruana in Armageddon, and had a winning position against Carlsen in Armageddon before spoiling it with an over-optimistic sacrifice of queen for two minor pieces. In contrast to Gukesh, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, 18, who had performed strongly in recent online and over-the-board events, had a rare failure at Stavanger, where he was on course to finish ninth out of 10. Carlsen won the previous four editions of Stavanger, but this time he misfired, scoring seven classical draws in a row. He won all seven ensuing Armageddons, yet the scoring system put him in the bottom half of the table. His career has long featured occasional blips, so his next two scheduled classical tournaments, in September-October at the European Club Cup and the Qatar Masters, will provide a better indication of whether his classical form is really in decline.

Bodhana Sivanandan is competing this week in the world girls under-eight rapid and blitz championships, titles she won at Rhodes in 2022 with 100% scores. This time, in Batumi, Georgia, the opposition is stronger, and includes girls from Russia (playing under a neutral Fide flag), India and Uzbekistan. Sivanandan, whose play is steadily improving with the help of a GM coach and who is particularly good in queenless middle games and endings, outclassed almost all her rapid rivals and won every game. Following her 17/17 at Rhodes 2022 and her 11/11 this week, she has now racked up 28 world championship wins in a row (eat your heart out, Bobby Fischer, who won only 20 straight in 1970-71). It will be interesting to see if Sivanandan can make it to 39/39 in the two-day blitz on Saturday and Sunday. Accidents and upsets are frequent in blitz, so it is far from a done deal, but fast speeds are one of her specialities.

The oil painting in question is not so much an artwork as a lift-music version of an artwork, and seems to hang at Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bedminster golf club in New Jersey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is the same place he buried his former wife Ivana, as all admirers of both exquisite taste and private-cemetery tax breaks may already know. Either way, Ivana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s there, right near the first tee. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what she would have wanted. As for her surviving ex-husband, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fashionable to say that anything that would represent a catastrophic setback for any other human being is exactly what Trump would have wanted. By this metric, his indictment on federal charges for the first time, including under the Espionage Act, is an absolute gift and a triumph. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll use it to pull in fundraising, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll rally his base, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make every Republican beta \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is to say, every Republican \u00e2\u20ac\u201c feel they have to swear loyalty to him. Furthermore, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already got him right where he most loves to be: with everyone talking about him. And these are all reasonable points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or at least reasonable in a through-the-looking-glass way, given that to many outside observers the United States passed reason two or three election cycles ago. If only they could invade themselves to bring democracy. Even so, it must be said the Espionage Act is one of the not-great laws to allegedly break, rather like obstruction of justice, of which Trump also stands accused. Individuals convicted of those felonies can face long stretches in facilities that are often entirely oil painting-free, and have never even been offered the chance to host a golf major. They do, however, have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd canteens and communal areas, which could make Mr Clubhouse feel at home. As always with this defendant, however, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not run ahead of ourselves. Trump has been indicted by the justice department on seven counts that are still under seal, but relate to his mishandling and retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. He is due in court on Tuesday in Miami. Following an incomplete search of his Palm Beach estate and club last year by members of his own legal team, then an FBI raid some months later, the documents saga constitutes something Trump keeps calling the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boxes hoax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Quick note on vocab: down the rabbit hole we all descended some years ago now, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hoax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the antidote to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153-gate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: a sort of all-purpose bolt-on Trump can use to dismiss any scandal. Once he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called it a hoax, the true scandal becomes the fact that anyone is trying to tar him with scandal. Trump himself becomes the poor local innocent who is being persecuted on account of his being mildly unconventional. See also: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153witch-hunt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. To Mar-a-Lago, then, where someone saw Goody Trump with a classified document about Iran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missile programme. And another about US intelligence work in China. And at least a hundred other mildly unconventional classified souvenirs of his time in office. Clearly, these are the sorts of keepsakes that any of us, had we ascended to the presidency, may afterwards wish to retain and transport to our home, which is also a members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 club thronging with hundreds of terrible people at any given time. Anyone now taking the opportunity to chant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lock him up!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is indulging in pure McCarthyism. Unfortunately, that is not how Jack Smith, special counsel for the documents investigation, seems to have seen it. I am also confused that Mr Smith has not accepted Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier suggestion that he could declassify documents merely by thinking about it. Last September, the former president told Fox News: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be a process, as I understand it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yet according to that old spoilsport \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the law\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, there apparently does. So here we are. In terms of where Trump himself is, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complicated. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the hot favourite for the Republican nomination, and also the defendant or potential defendant in a number of ongoing legal actions. There simply isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the space to recap all of them, but the standouts are the charges of hush-money payments to Stormy Daniels, on which he has already been indicted by Manhattan state prosecutors, and the federal criminal investigation into his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results, which remains in train and for which Smith is also the special counsel. Speaking of McCarthys, finally, the house speaker, Kevin McCarthy, reacted to news of the Trump indictment in that hyper-partisan, truth-free way that has become so commonplace that it should surely redefine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153McCarthyism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for our own era. Having begun with a false claim (that Joe Biden indicted Trump), Kevin sought to delegitimise a legitimate process before kowtowing to Trump in entirely abject style. Even Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not-very-arch rival for the Republican nomination, Ron DeSantis, was too weak to do anything other than obediently defend Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while elsewhere, a new poll found that 43% of Republicans believed Trump should be allowed to serve again even if he were convicted of a felony. However positive some may feel about the charges, the whole picture is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how to put this? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no oil painting. Ultimately, Trump will be easier to deal with than the culture he has created.

Demand for home loans was strong and mortgage lenders were vying to offer the most attractive deals. House prices were up 12.5% year on year, according to the Halifax. The mood is now different. This week, the Halifax and the Nationwide building society announced that fixed-rate mortgages would become more expensive. HSBC has temporarily withdrawn all its deals for new borrowers. House prices have started to fall. The Halifax\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s monthly report on the state of the market showed that after peaking in August last year the average cost of a home has dropped by \u00c2\u00a37,500 to \u00c2\u00a3286,500. That decline needs to be put into context. Even after the falls since the summer of 2022 the average house price is still \u00c2\u00a325,000 more than it was two years ago. Negative equity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a home worth less than the remaining balance of the mortgage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is still a rarity. Even so, the property industry is braced for further falls. New housebuilding has dropped sharply because contractors can see little point in starting new homes when demand is likely to remain weak. Annual house price inflation, according to the Halifax, has just turned negative for the first time in more than a decade. The big question is not whether prices will continue to drop but how big the drop will be. The rating agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is pencilling in a fall of 10% over the next two years. Adjusted for inflation the drop would be even bigger. Any drop comes against a backdrop of stubborn cost of living pressures. Annual inflation is running at 8.7% and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on Bank of England forecasts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will still be running at 3.5% next spring. That suggests the real \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inflation-adjusted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fall in house prices could be about double the nominal fall: of the order of 25% if Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forecasts are accurate. Much will depend on what the Bank of England does with interest rates. A month ago, estate agents had been hopeful that the property market was stabilising after the shock administered by Liz Truss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short-lived government last autumn. Inflation was set to tumble, raising hopes that the Bank would call a halt to a series of 12 interest rate increases that had taken the official cost of borrowing from 0.1% to 4.5% over the course of 18 months. In reality, that was always likely to be an overoptimistic view. It takes time for past increases in interest rates to work their way through the economy and the Bank estimates that only about 30% of the pain from the jump in rates to 4.5% has so far been felt by consumers. Inflation duly came down from 10.1% to 8.7% in April, but the fall was smaller than anticipated, and core inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which strips out food and energy costs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c actually rose. Markets are now pricing in at least three further 0.25 percentage-point increases from the Bank of England by the end of the year. Rate cuts are not expected until the second half of next year. Kim Kinnaird, the director of Halifax mortgages, said the prospect of higher interest rates from the Bank had meant fixed mortgage rates were rising again across the market. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This will inevitably impact confidence in the housing market as both buyers and sellers adjust their expectations, and latest industry figures for both mortgage approvals and completed transactions show demand is cooling. Therefore, further downward pressure on house prices is still expected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Mortgage rates are now approaching levels reached last autumn, and the financial pain for those affected will be considerable. About 1.4 million homebuyers have fixed-rate mortgages that expire in 2023, and more than half of them fixed in 2021 when mortgages were available at 2%. They will be refinancing at getting on for three times that rate. Earlier this week the retail financial products data provider Moneyfacts said the average rate on a new two-year fixed mortgage was running at more than 5.8%. The cost of servicing a typical \u00c2\u00a3200,000 home loan has increased by \u00c2\u00a360 a month since the start of May. Spending on other items will inevitably suffer. Property insiders are doing their best to be upbeat. Tom Bill, the head of residential research at the estate agents Knight Frank, predicted a 5% drop in house prices this year but said the market was coming back to earth, not falling off a cliff. Iain McKenzie, the chief executive of the Guild of Property Professionals, said there had not been the dramatic contraction some predicted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People need a roof over their head and the UK is not building enough homes, so there will always be demand,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Much hinges on whether unemployment remains low. If it does, the soft landing that the optimists are hoping for may materialise. If it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, prices will fall by a lot more than 5%. Either way there will be no pre-election feelgood factor from the property market for the government. The boom is over."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/labour-green-prosperity-plan-cost-markets-rachel-reeves-taxes-john-mcdonnell", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "Labour doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to sabotage its green prosperity plan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just to cost it clearly | John McDonnell", "lead": "The argument that markets will react badly to borrowing doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wash, says the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell", "author": "John McDonnell", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T12:11:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896573", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3d00bfd7a2a6db1838c26428a492cc08772d30cd/0_185_3912_2347/500.jpg", "body": "Today, Rachel Reeves announced that she is delaying plans to borrow \u00c2\u00a328bn a year for a green prosperity fund under a Labour government. There may be some influential people in the Labour party who never supported the plan in the first place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe because it looked so much like the 2019 manifesto. And now, perhaps as a result, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing any excuse being used to undermine it. The argument being put forward is that the bond markets will react to Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s borrowing in the same way they responded to Liz Truss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fantasy budget. This would make the necessary borrowing too expensive to deal with, and anyway, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impractical to spend on that scale in the early years of a government. Both of these arguments need exposing for what they really are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c attempts to sabotage the central plank of the next Labour government. The bond markets reacted negatively to the Truss budget because the figures just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stack up. The tax cuts were unfunded and, to add to the uncertainty, the then chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had failed to put them through the normal Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) assessment. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no wonder, then, that they lacked credibility in the eyes of the international markets. After five years touring round the City in meeting after meeting with asset managers and investor bodies, I learned that the markets may not like the policies a government wants to pursue, but if they see you are determined, have a practical plan and they can see some investment opportunities, they will live with it. Signalling that you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be swept off course is also critical because investors want certainty and they need to know that sometimes you are prepared to face down threats. Here is an anecdote, which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think is betraying a confidence. On election day in 2019 I received a call from Mark Carney, then governor of the Bank of England, who in the normal course of events I had met regularly as shadow chancellor and with whom I had established a helpful working relationship. The call was to reassure me that the Bank, with its resources, stood ready for whatever the outcome the election would produce. For me this message to the markets, that the central bank stood behind us, would be critical in securing a stable transfer of political power. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the message the Bank of England sent to the markets about the Truss budget. What is needed now to overcome concerns about market reactions is the publication of a more detailed step-by-step plan for the implementation of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s green prosperity plan over the lifetime of the next two parliaments, as proposed. This would set out in more detail what the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expenditure and financial needs would be, how they could be met, and how any borrowing would be paid back. It does mean the Labour party coming out of purdah on the range of tax measures that will be in place, both to invest and pay back lenders. This would reassure markets that any costs would be covered and funded even within its existing fiscal rule. As shadow chancellor, I committed to offering opposition parties access to the OBR to assess their budget proposals. Labour should demand of the government the opportunity to put its plans now to the OBR for scrutiny and assessment. This would have an overall benefit to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing in the world markets by reassuring them that all potential outcomes of the next election have been fully assessed independently. As important as the programme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financing plan is, it is now certainly time that the practical implementation of the plan and schedule is drafted, consulted upon and published. This will stand the opposition in good stead, in that any practical implementation issues can be ironed out before the policy proposals are provided to the civil service in the normal manner for their pre-election preparations for a possible change of government. This implementation plan must inevitably recognise that spending will be limited in the early years as the physical resources, especially workforce recruitment and training, are put in place. Total spend should remain the same and any smaller spending in the early years can be made up in the later years as the programme becomes fully geared up. This is the usual process of any programme of which capital spend is a heavy ingredient. The key challenge, and one we must not lose sight of, is ensuring that our climate change targets are met. If the clouds of smog that are choking New Yorkers tell us anything, it is that there is no time to lose, no delay that can be countenanced, and there must be no reduction in the level of financial commitment to what is needed if we are to save our planet.

For some connoisseurs, it is an all-time classic and proof of the brilliance of Tony McPhee, the band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s songwriter and guitarist who has died aged 79. According to Luke Haines, formerly of the Auteurs, Thank Christ \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a kind of concept album, a psychedelic, very heavy CND album full of class war. The album is a scorched earth manifesto.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Damned\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Captain Sensible contended that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tony McPhee \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 was the British Hendrix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Groundhogs had emerged from the British blues boom of the mid-1960s, and as the 70s dawned they embraced the expansive, exploratory spirit of the era. A performance at the 1970 Isle of Wight festival affirmed their growing status. The follow-up to Thank Christ was Split (1971), which climbed to No 5 and found McPhee wrestling with ideas around split personality and loss of self. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I went through a stage of split personality myself and in the lyrics I try to explain what it is like \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a very deep, traumatic experience,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he revealed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One moment you feel all right, the next you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know who you are.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The album included the frantic, heavy-metal stomp of Cherry Red, which got the band on to the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Top of the Pops. In 1971 they supported the Rolling Stones on their British tour, during which they recorded the limited-edition live album Live at Leeds \u00e2\u20ac\u212271. The following year they were high in the British charts again with Who Will Save the World? The Mighty Groundhogs, but that year also saw the replacement of drummer Ken Pustelnik with Clive Brooks. The next album, Hogwash (1972), had many admirers but marked the end of the band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial hot streak. Their progress stalled amid a string of lineup changes and regular disbandments. They made their last chart appearance with Solid, which reached No 1 in 1974. Born in Humberston, Lincolnshire, Tony was the son of Charles McPhee, a telegraphist in the Royal Navy and then a civil servant in the Ministry of Defence, and Eileen (nee Harrison). The family moved to south London when Tony was one, and he later attended Tooting Bec grammar school. He developed an early enthusiasm for the blues when his brother took home imported LPs of American blues artists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was then that I first heard this raw stuff and my ears pricked up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told Classic Rock magazine. Another formative influence on him was the British blues harmonica player Cyril Davies (who would die in 1964 aged 31). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I used to go and see him at the Marquee Club,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said McPhee. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Somebody said something about this R&amp;B band and they were there every Thursday and they were just magic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Groundhogs came into being after McPhee, who had been fronting his own group, the Seneschals, joined the Dollar Bills in 1962. This was an outfit formed in New Cross, south-east London, by brothers Pete and John Cruickshank. McPhee pushed the band into a more blues-influenced direction, as he explained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We went into R&amp;B and then into blues very deeply \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to the extent that I spent most of my time delving into books and records to find material which hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been done by any of the other English bands.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They named themselves after John Lee Hooker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s song Ground Hog Blues, and in 1964 they temporarily renamed themselves John Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Groundhogs when they backed Hooker on a UK tour, after John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers dropped out. Hooker liked the band so much he recruited them to play on his album \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 And Seven Nights (1966, later reissued as Hooker and the Hogs) and teamed up with them again for his 1965 British tour. Hooker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s endorsement was a powerful calling card and the band found themselves in demand, also backing Little Walter, Champion Jack Dupree and Jimmy Reed when they toured Britain. Both McPhee and Eric Clapton appeared on Dupree\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s album From New Orleans to Chicago (1966). When Clapton left Mayall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s band in 1965, McPhee was asked to join but declined. The Groundhogs split in 1966, after which McPhee played with John Cruickshank in Herbal Mixture and spent a brief spell with the John Dummer Blues Band, but in 1968 a new Groundhogs rose from the ashes. McPhee was joined by Pete Cruickshank on bass and Pustelnik on drums, plus Steve Rye on harmonica and vocals. At the end of the year they released their first album under a deal with Liberty Records, Scratching the Surface. The follow-up, Blues Obituary, appeared the following year, now without Rye. The trio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dynamic, freewheeling playing placed the Groundhogs alongside such progressively inclined blues practitioners as Ten Years After and Led Zeppelin. McPhee saw the album as a turning point, the moment when the Groundhogs stopped being just a blues band. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I like to call it progressive in the sense that we were progressing away from the blues,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was his assessment. The stage was set for their breakthrough with Thank Christ for the Bomb. McPhee released five solo albums, the last of them being Bleaching the Blues (1997). His solo debut, The Two Sides of TS McPhee (1973; TS stands for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tough Shit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), was by far the most memorable. The first side was a feast of raw, mostly acoustic blues, while side two comprised the single track The Hunt, where McPhee recited an anti-foxhunting narrative against a patchwork of experimental synthesiser sounds. A new Groundhogs lineup released the albums Crosscut Saw and Black Diamond in 1976, and McPhee led two different versions of the band during the 90s. In 2003 the McPhee/Pustelnik/Cruickshank lineup reformed for some 40th-anniversary shows, after which McPhee performed with various players as Tony McPhee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Groundhogs, while Cruickshank and Pustelnik formed the Groundhogs Rhythm Section with assorted additional musicians. McPhee also performed with David Tibet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153apocalyptic folk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outfit Current 93, and with the vocalist Joanna Deacon, whom McPhee married in 2008. In 2014, he retired Tony McPhee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Groundhogs. He was married twice before, to Christine Payne, with whom he had a son, Conan, and Susan Harrison, with whom he had a son, Vincent. Both marriages ended in divorce. Joanna survives him, as do his children, two grandchildren, Scarlett and Victor, and his sister Olive. Tony (Anthony Charles) McPhee, musician and songwriter, born 23 March 1944; died 6 June 2023"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/09/home-office-backs-down-on-plan-for-asylum-seekers-to-sleep-four-in-a-room", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Home Office backs down on plan for asylum seekers to sleep four to a room", "lead": "Move follows protest by refugees who had been told they would be sharing small London hotel rooms", "author": "Diane Taylor", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T12:02:40Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896584", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eaa0d88d3039905a2cc1d39f6bb7c3a39337820a/631_1044_4799_2881/500.jpg", "body": "The Home Office has backed down on plans for asylum seekers to sleep four to a small room in a central London hotel after protests by 40 refugees last week. The rooms in the hotel in Pimlico, Westminster are small and asylum seekers had previously been sharing two to a room. The Home Office said it wanted to increase the number of asylum seekers sharing one room to save money. Several asylum seekers told the Guardian there was not enough space to fit four people into one small room, that they had to store their clothes on the little floor space available, and that the claustrophobic conditions were stressful. According to a letter posted on Twitter on 8 June to Adam Hug, the leader of Westminster council, the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, said the decision to double the number of asylum seekers in one room was part of a plan to reduce the number of hotels used to accommodate asylum seekers by 90 and would save \u00c2\u00a3250m a year. Hug and Jenrick have traded accusations on the social media platform about the whose fault the protest was. Hug said the Home Office had not informed the council in advance of the arrival of more than 40 additional asylum seekers to this hotel in the course of meetings. He accused the Home Office of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153having mismanaged that process\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and leaving people \u00e2\u20ac\u0153standing on the street outside the hotel for the entire night\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hug understands that the group were sharing two to a room in their previous hotel, but when they arrived in Pimlico they were asked to share with three others. This prompted the protest, which was resolved when the Home Office reverted to rooms of two. Jenrick said there were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153numerous incorrect and misleading statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd made by Hug in a previous letter he wrote to the Home Office about the asylum seekers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pimlico pavement protest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First, you stated that 40 asylum seekers were placed on the streets of Westminster. That is not true. All the individuals involved claimed to be destitute and as a result a generous offer of accommodation was made to each of them by the Home Office, using taxpayer funds, to accommodate them in the hotel concerned. Some individuals initially turned down this offer and instead chose to stand outside the hotel in protest of their own volition.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jenrick added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is fair and reasonable to require people to share a room.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In his previous letter to the Home Office, Hug said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When dealing with a group of people, many of whom are likely to have been through significant and traumatic events that have led them to seek asylum, asking them to share an inappropriately sized room with multiple strangers defies common sense and basic decency.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that the government demand that four people share one room created \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safeguarding and health risks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leaving them on the street for multiple nights is not an alternative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

For the two marine traffic controllers sitting at the very top of the glass tower overlooking the congested harbour, it is like an enormous high-stakes round of the classic computer puzzle game Tetris. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been busy all morning. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only got a couple of berths free [in the north harbour] and the south harbour is full already. There are a few vessels out at sea waiting for berths,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one of the controllers. Below the marine operations centre, a small army of dockers are loading the vessels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bare backs with containers of machinery, PPE, water and food supplies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are a good barometer for the oil and gas industry. When there is new drilling or maintenance, it is these vessels that are called into use,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Roddy James, the port\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief commercial officer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And our forecast for the year is showing an increase of about 15% of where we were last year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a decade of confusion and stasis, Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fortunes have been transformed by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the invasion of Ukraine, with its focus on securing domestic oil and gas supplies. While the already heavily plundered North Sea is in natural decline, ministers are determined to slow the decline by boosting production and developing new fields. In October more than 70 companies applied for 115 licences to search for new fields and reopen closed wells in 258 areas of the North Sea. Some of the successful projects, which will be announced later this year, could be producing in as little as 14 months. James, a former deep sea oil platform diver who grew up in Aberdeen, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be more upbeat: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prior to Ukraine, we would have been talking about how we survive \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about revival.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But for many this new spurt of prospecting is desperately problematic. In 2021 the International Energy Agency calculated that the world could afford no new fossil fuel exploration if the world wanted to stay within safe limits of global warming. The 6bn barrels of oil and gas that officials have calculated could be profitably extracted from the North Sea would release 2.5bn tonnes of CO2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seven times the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual emissions. And even as the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, trumpeted the Aberdeen expansion, the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, appeared to grasp the problem and committed to no new exploration in the oilfields, throwing his lot in with the people hoping that the city can reinvent itself as the energy rather than the oil capital of Europe. Right now, the city feels poised, like so many industries and countries, at a critical fork in the road. UK ministers and oil industry leaders set out their grand vision for the future of the North Sea more than two years ago: the North Sea Transition Deal promised a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prosperous future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for communities dependent on the oil industry, with reskilling for workers and new jobs in renewables. The plan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a partnership between business and government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c focuses on large-scale stuff. Carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS), offshore wind and hydrogen are set as the way forward. The decarbonisation of the oil industry will lead, according to the deal, to up to \u00e2\u20ac\u015340,000 direct and indirect supply chain jobs in decarbonising UKCS [United Kingdom Continental Shelf] production and the CCUS and hydrogen sectors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Scottish government, which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t control production in the North Sea, has drawn up its own just transition plan, which has just gone through a consultation. It too promises any changes will benefit workers and communities. Holyrood has committed \u00c2\u00a3500m over 10 years to help communities in the north-east and Moray move away from carbon-intensive industries as part of the plan. Some of this money is being channelled through a national investment bank into the expansion of Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s port, which supporters of the scheme claim will enable it to play a bigger role in decommissioning old rigs as well as wind turbine servicing. But campaigners have complained much of the funding is going to business groups, often backed by fossil fuel interests, rather than to communities and workers. One of the largest awards went to the Energy Transition Zone (ETZ), a not-for-profit company, chaired by oil tycoon Ian Wood. The firm is developing CCUS, hydrogen production and offshore wind in Aberdeen. The oilworkers themselves have, as you would expect, mixed feelings about the future. At the Aberdeen heliport, where they are ferried on and off the rigs, they are keen to get home \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the hardest part of the job is being away from family and friends. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a six and a three-year-old. They find it tough and so does my wife, especially by the third week away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd oil worker Dan says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have your ups and downs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Video calls can help but they also remind riggers of what they are missing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked with guys who were out in the North Sea in the 1970s. All they got was one 10-minute phone call. Now they can have instant contact. But they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s better or worse,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Dan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can have too much information.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The money can be good when the industry is booming. Some in the pub are earning \u00c2\u00a360,000 to \u00c2\u00a370,000 a year. But crashes can be brutal, sending the guys who were driving a BMW back home to live with their parents. Despite the insecurity and the hardships, there is pride in supplying the nation with energy in the midst of an energy crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jackdaw and Cambo [oilfields] have been given the green light now. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being told to get out there and drill them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because of Ukraine,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Dan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got the gas and oil so we may as well use it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than buying it in.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is unease about the climate crisis, alongside a feeling of powerlessness familiar to many. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Of course, I worry [about a warming world]. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got two kids,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says John. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But what I can do? I recycle. I try not to use the car. I walk when I can. I get the train. I try not to fly \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I do my little bit.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But few are in a position to switch to the renewable sector. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the jobs at my level,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Andrew, 34, whose red-rimmed, dark eyes tell their own story of long shifts in harsh conditions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oil requires more people to run and maintain the equipment as opposed to your wind turbines, which are pretty self-sufficient when they are up and running.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Around Aberdeen, there are scores of energy producers, including some of the biggest names in the industry such as BP and Shell. Despite months of requests, none are prepared to take the Guardian to see offshore exploration or even meet to discuss their involvement in new gas and oil projects. Wood Group, founded by Wood, is one of the few willing to make the case for the industry it loyally served for more than six decades; like a few others the company emerged from the fishing industry to become an engineering contractor providing the skilled workforce needed to operate oil rigs in the boom years of the North Sea, and now spans more than 60 countries and employs about 35,000 people. Last year the company secured half a billion dollars worth of contracts for oil and gas projects in the North Sea, and the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s order book is growing again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect oil and gas to grow by about 6% out to 2025 in the UK,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Steve Nicol, the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive president of operations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I definitely feel energy security has had a major impact on the outlook for oil and gas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just over half of the firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s revenue comes from oil and gas. But it expects an increasing proportion could come from hydrogen and carbon storage in former oilfields. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I care as much about the planet as everyone but there aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough renewable energy solutions at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If people want heat and light in their homes then we will need oil and gas for some time. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just stop oil and gas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nicol feels oil producers are often unfairly maligned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a bit of demonising of the oil and gas industry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the firms we work for will probably have the biggest impact on energy transition.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Of a story earlier in the week about the fact that the company took a $430m (\u00c2\u00a3346m) transition loan but has reduced its renewable work, the company says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business was repositioned following the sale of the Built Environment business in 2022 and following this change, we paid down two-thirds of the bank loan value. This change was a contributing factor to the reduction in our sustainable revenues in 2022. However, we have stated that we anticipate significant growth in sustainable revenues from sectors such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage through to 2025 and beyond.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stuart Payne, the new chief executive of North Sea Transition Authority, which assesses applications for licences to drill, sees no contradiction between this role and his other duty, which is to enable the country to reach net zero by 2050. He says fossil fuels still meet three-quarters of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy demand and will continue to play an essential role for decades to come: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a transition, not a cliff-edge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The authority is aware of 26 new oil and gas projects, with 19 operators drawing up field development plans to start producing oil and gas. Payne maintains it is better to produce oil and gas in the North Sea as it is less carbon intensive than imports, which make up half of the oil and gas used in the country: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Imported liquefied natural gas has a carbon footprint two-and-a-half times the gas we produce off the east coast of England and Scotland.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The government only allowed the latest licensing round to go ahead after it passed what it called a climate compatibility checkpoint. However, the checkpoint only takes into account the emissions created during fossil fuel production, not the far larger emissions from the burning of oil and gas, which account for 95% of the total emissions produced. Payne says his officials are carrying out their own additional assessments of production emissions but concedes they cannot examine the full carbon cost of the oil and gas, known as scope three emissions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I accept that excludes scope three emissions. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I can control and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I make a difference on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dutch physicist Erik Dalhuijsen, founder of Aberdeen Climate Action, disagrees with the central premise from both Payne and Nicol that new fields are necessary to meet demands. Dalhuijsen works by day on petroleum reservoirs but refuses to work on new projects and is pressing the industry to run down hydrocarbons as fast as possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are assuming demand is immutable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A big home insulation programme would reduce total UK emissions by 15% to 35% and would remove a large part of the energy demand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And Michael Lazarus, the senior scientist tasked with updating the UN Environment Programme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assessment of oil, gas and coal production plans agrees with Dalhuijsen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Governments are planning twice the amount of production of fossil fuels that is consistent with a 1.5C pathway,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says on a video call from his home in Seattle. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re serious about meeting their climate pledges \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the UK has a very ambitious one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they need to put measures in place for a decline in production. This goes in the opposite direction. It further puts climate goals at risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The government and the industry may want to focus the public attention on developing new oilfields to meet demand in the UK. But, in fact, most of the oil produced in the North Sea is refined abroad and all of it is sold on global markets. This has impacts way beyond these shores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you increase production, prices go down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Lazarus. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That drives demand and slows down the transition away from oil dependence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The example he gives is simple and stark: if the UK produces, say, 100 additional barrels of oil it may import 100 barrels less but another 20 or 50 barrels are going to be consumed elsewhere and in the UK because prices will fall slightly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This needs to be reckoned with and built into models,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having an honest conversation about what are the effects of producing more oil in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it needs include the fact that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be more oil consumed in the world as a result.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If countries make the necessary, urgent energy transition, many of the new fields will not be needed by the time they are producing. They will only be profitable, adds Lazarus, if the governments across the globe fail to make the switch quickly enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is like betting against the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These growing tensions are all on show in the battle over the St Fittick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Park, on the eastern fringes of the city. The wetland in Torry, the poorest neighbourhood in north-east Scotland, has been created by local residents, and is perhaps Aberdeen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most unlikely beauty spot. Reeds flap and bend in blasts of salt-edged wind. Grey and blue light catch in watery beds, where ducks dip and preen. Birds shelter in a young woodland of oak, dark green pine and silvery birch trees. However, plans published by the ETZ mean a third of the wetland would be turned into a green industrial hub. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153St Fitticks is the only park we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got. It is stunningly beautiful. The wildlife and flowers are second to none. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got no right to touch it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Betty Lyon, 66, a retired union organiser, who has spent almost her entire life in Torry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only place we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got left to get some fresh air for our children.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Friends of St Fittick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Park group sees the latest threat as another corporate-driven incursion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The oil industry is using the language of transition to carry on as they have always done and control the pace of change,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Scott Herrett, a resident who also works for Friends of the Earth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of oil and gas interests are involved in the ETZ.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Herrett wants to see a very different, grassroots-led transition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to ensure that the people most affected, like this community and oil workers, are part of the decision-making, not just consulted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then we need to ensure the costs and benefits of the transition are fairly distributed. But at the moment the cost for this development is being paid by the people of Torry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some of the millions of public money spent on the ETZ could insulate thousands of homes in Torry, the group suggests. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These houses are cold and damp,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Adrian Crofton, 51, a local GP, another supporter of the campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 I write regular letters about damp homes asking for people to be moved.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ETZ says it understands concerns about the loss of green public space, which it is seeking to minimise, but the land is needed to transport large components from the quayside in order to ensure Aberdeen capitalises on the opportunities provided by green energies, such as offshore wind. It says the rest of the park will be improved and that the Scottish government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presumption against further exploration is counterproductive, as it will just lead to higher carbon-heavy imports. Across the fast-flowing River Dee, Jake Molloy, who heads the offshore energy branch of the RMT and sits on the Scottish government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just transition commission, also questions the route of the transition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bollocks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, shaking his head. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t produced a single turbine. We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t manufactured a single blade. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any battery storage. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the [grid] capacity. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not retrofitting our homes. We are doing nothing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 apart from waiting for some magical investment genie to come along. It is absolute bollocks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Worker representatives are in the minority on the advisory bodies overseeing the changes and new renewable infrastructure is likely to remain in private hands, with only one offshore wind turbine owned by a UK government-funded research centre. All the Scottish offshore territory auctioned for wind schemes at the start of the year went to fossil-fuel majors, private energy companies, and operators owned by other states, with one study suggesting there are no guarantees supply chains will even be developed in Scotland. The RMT has travelled the length of Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s east coast in an effort to recruit offshore renewable workers but in all but one port found only one or two small crew transfer vessels. The largest workforce was in Wick, where they were three transporters taking 10 to 12 workers out to the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest windfarm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Molloy. Most of the jobs are in turbine manufacturing, which invariably takes place elsewhere, and installation is frequently carried out by sometimes low-paid international crews. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are vessels coming from all around the world from the Philippines, China, Malaysia, Bulgaria and Romania,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Molloy, who has a right to board ships docked in ports to speak to workers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are finding guys working for a few dollars a day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Instead of publicly owned windfarm operators creating jobs and wealth for the entire country, the RMT says Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seabed is being sold off to private interests. It feels like a repeat of the North Sea oil boom to Molloy, who was a fresh-faced 21-year-old plumber when he first went offshore. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have not really benefited from oil and gas,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Molloy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Compare that to Norway, where the entire welfare state is funded by the sovereign wealth fund [which was created with oil profits]. We have the chance to do the same with renewables \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it is passing us by.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/09/manchester-united-1998-99-manchester-city-2022-23-how-they-compare", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "How they compare: Manchester United 1998-99 and Manchester City 2022-23", "lead": "We run the rule over United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treble winners and the City team trying to emulate them in Saturday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Champions League final \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and select a combined XI", "author": "Jamie Jackson", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T12:00:53Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896589", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/29668fe3049c32ea820ecc15f42f2b016cddb6a7/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "How the season unfolded Manchester United: Sir Alex Ferguson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team were masters of harum-scarum wins in defining matches. To claim the Premier League on the final day Tottenham had to be defeated but after 24 minutes a Les Ferdinand goal stunned Old Trafford before United, in blazing sunshine, staged a memorable comeback via David Beckham and Andy Cole. In the FA Cup fourth round United were 1-0 down to Liverpool until the 88th minute, then finishes from Dwight Yorke and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00c3\u00a6r knocked out their great rivals. In semi-final extra time Ryan Giggs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wonder solo effort eliminated Arsenal and in the Champions League semi-final second leg in Turin Juventus pulled 2-0 ahead on the night (3-1 on aggregate) via a Filippo Inzaghi double before a Roy Keane-inspired turnaround beat the Italian club. Then there was the cartoon-like end to the final: down 1-0 in added time to Bayern Munich, the substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Solskj\u00c3\u00a6r scored to put United in dreamland and clinch the treble. Manchester City: When Pep Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s men lost to United on 14 January and Arsenal beat Tottenham the next day Mikel Arteta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s side moved eight points clear. A month later it was all square after City won 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium, having played a game more. Although City immediately dropped points at Nottingham Forest, they then put together a sequence of wins, including another over Arsenal, until the title was won. The FA Cup campaign was serene, ending with a 19-1 aggregate triumph across their six matches, the one goal conceded coming from a United penalty in the final. The Champions League (so far) has been similar. In the group stage, 14 goals struck, two conceded and zero defeats. The knockout phase has brought emphatic aggregate wins against RB Leipzig (8-1), Bayern Munich (4-1) and Real Madrid (5-1). How the tactics compare Manchester United: Ferguson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team were a fluid 4-4-2, with Yorke (or his deputy Sheringham) often dropping off the front and Giggs floating inside from the left to make it a quasi 4-2-3-1, with Cole at the tip and Beckham pushing up from midfield. This left Keane and Paul Scholes as a classy central duo in front of a rock-solid back four containing Gary Neville and Denis Irwin, the full-backs who would bolster the attack, plus Jaap Stam, one of United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest centre-backs, and either Ronny Johnsen or Henning Berg. In goal was the outstanding Peter Schmeichel. Manchester City: This term\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major addition has been Erling Haaland, whose 36 goals from 35 Premier League appearances is a storybook achievement in his first English season. Although his arrival caused City to recalibrate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at times awkwardly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are, again, the smooth-passing technical proposition who hog possession and know when to thrust forward. From the delivery of Ederson, a goalkeeper uber-comfortable using his feet, the defenders Walker, R\u00c3\u00baben Dias, John Stones and, latterly, Manuel Akanji initiate attacks which course through Rodri and Stones (who often steps upfield). From the wings Jack Grealish (or Phil Foden) and Bernardo Silva (or Riyad Mahrez) are instructed by Guardiola to dart at opponents aggressively while Ilkay G\u00c3\u00bcndogan glides about scheming, and the peerless Kevin De Bruyne is the master of the pass that releases Haaland. The key players Manchester United: So many. Schmeichel may be United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest ever goalkeeper, Irwin in the same rank at left-back, and Giggs, too, has a case for being in the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time XI. If Scholes might be squeezed out of that by Bobby Charlton, Keane is the clear standout footballer of the 99 vintage, an on-field personification of Ferguson, the driving force who refused to lose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c his header sparked the comeback in Turin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and whose relentless demand for excellence cast him as a captain for the ages. He was suspended for the Champions League final but United performed in his (and Ferguson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) never-say-we-have-lost image. Manchester City: De Bruyne walks, surely, into a best-ever Premier League XI, along with Haaland and Walker, while Ederson is in the shake-up to be a reserve to Schmeichel. Dias\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cold-eyed focus and natural leadership make him a formidable defender while G\u00c3\u00bcndogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability (seemingly) to pad about unnoticed, killing opponents with his vision and penchant for scoring when it counts (each of City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s goals in the Cup final, for example) is matched by Grealish\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergence, in his second season, as a direct wide man who breaks lines. Mahrez, Foden (who has been hampered by injury), Juli\u00c3\u00a1n \u00c3\ufffdlvarez (a Qatar 2022 World Cup winner with Argentina) and the youngster Rico Lewis are a glittering support cast. The weak spots Manchester United: Berg and Johnsen taking it in turns to partner Stam in central defence points to an obvious vulnerability in the backline and Neville\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rudimentary talent makes the right-back area one that could have been improved too. It is otherwise difficult to pick holes, which is no surprise. Beckham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precise crossing and pinpoint passing suggested he was a natural central midfielder (where he operated versus Bayern) stationed on the right, but if his sluggish pace was not that of the classic wingman, the side\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style and Beckham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feisty attitude make this a non-factor. Manchester City: Left-back (kind of). Jo\u00c3\u00a3o Cancelo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s falling-out with Guardiola over reduced game time ended in the defender becoming footballer non grata and being loaned to Bayern in the winter window. So with Oleksandr Zinchenko previously sold to Arsenal and Sergio G\u00c3\u00b3mez not meeting the Guardiola standard, a job share featuring Nathan Ak\u00c3\u00a9, Aymeric Laporte, Silva (very rarely) and Akanji has been the manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solution, with the last of these the most trusted. The overall speed of the defence has been a point of scrutiny given that City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high line can be exposed. That does not apply to Walker because the right-back, at 33, seems to be getting even faster.

Just because supermarkets have a monopoly on sub-\u00c2\u00a37 wines doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean they are cheapest for everything. Rather, they rely on us believing that everything we buy from them is keenly priced, when in reality it may well not be, especially if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on promotion and involves a famous name. Supermarkets are generally not so good at providing less well-known alternatives that offer better value. I was reminded of this the other day at a tasting put on by the very smart wine merchant Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark (with that name, they could easily be a firm of solicitors, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t they?), which has branches in Chelsea and Stow-on-the-Wold in the Cotswolds. Unaffordable? Surprisingly not. For example, they have a fantastic selection of clarets, starting with the smartly bottled Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau Frontenac Bordeaux Sup\u00c3\u00a9rieur 2019 (14.5%) at \u00c2\u00a310.95 a bottle (or \u00c2\u00a358.20, or \u00c2\u00a39.70 a bottle, for a case of six). And it would be so much better to buy their Faure-Beausejour 2019, a fleshy, ripe, merlot-dominated fronsac at \u00c2\u00a312.35 (or \u00c2\u00a365.70 by the half-case), than most of the indifferent Saint-\u00c3\u2030milions you find on supermarket shelves. (Incidentally, supermarkets do score when they go off-piste in this way, too: Tesco, for instance, has an absolutely cracking, bordeaux-like bergerac right now called Eglise Saint Jacques (13%) for just \u00c2\u00a36.50. (Bergerac is just next door to its more famous neighbour.) Household names such as chablis, sancerre and ch\u00c3\u00a2teauneuf-du-pape are no longer the bargains they once were, but if you want to experience what they have to offer, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a much better bet to buy them from an indie than from a supermarket (or from a restaurant wine list, incidentally, where they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re definitely best avoided). Better still to buy one of the lesser-known appellations such as the deliciously summery quincy, also from the Loire, in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pick. My late husband introduced me to it when I first met him, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always had a particularly soft spot for the stuff. Ros\u00c3\u00a9, admittedly, is going to be cheaper in supermarkets, but not that much, given that they are also pushing bottles that cost \u00c2\u00a315-20. The delicately creamy Domaine Tour Campanets Esprit Ros\u00c3\u00a9 (12.5%), again from Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark, is just lovely and, at \u00c2\u00a313.50 (or \u00c2\u00a312 by the half-case), not unreasonably priced for Provence. For an unusual and delectably peachy white from Provence, meanwhile, try the MiP (Made in Provence) Classic White from Lea &amp; Sandeman (\u00c2\u00a316.95, or \u00c2\u00a314.95 by the case, 12.5%), which is just gorgeous. (As I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said many times before, it can often make sense to split the cost with friends or wine-loving neighbours.) Five great summer buys from two top wine merchants Parcelles Pinot Noir Domaine R\u00c3\u00a9thor\u00c3\u00a9 Davy 2022 \u00c2\u00a312.10 (or \u00c2\u00a310.75 by an unsplit case of 12) Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark, 13%. Deliciously perfumed and much better than most cheap burgundy. Quincy Villalin Domaine Jacques Rouz\u00c3\u00a9 \u00c2\u00a317.25 (or \u00c2\u00a315.35 by an unsplit case of 12) Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark, 13%. Delicate, pretty, lesser-known Loire sauvignon blanc \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a keener-priced alternative to sancerre. Pazo da Maga 2022 Karma do Sil \u00c2\u00a316.95 (or \u00c2\u00a315.50 as part of a mixed case) Lea &amp; Sandeman, 13%. Irresistibly bright, summery godello from Ribeira Sacra in northern Spain. A Dos Manos Garnacha A Pie de Tierra \u00c2\u00a315.95 (or \u00c2\u00a314.50 as part of a mixed case) Lea &amp; Sandeman, 14.5%. Lighter than the ABV might suggest, and brimming with summer berry fruit. Scrumptious. Kerner Kellerei Kurtatsch 2022 \u00c2\u00a319.10 (or \u00c2\u00a316.95 by a case of 6) Haynes, Hanson &amp; Clark.

It digs into the story of Megan Bhari who, inspired by her own cancer diagnosis, launched a charity when she was 16 years old that gained the support of One Direction. We meet the sceptics who hired a private investigator because they did not believe Megan was actually unwell, only to be baffled by her sudden death. It adds a layer of tragedy to an already murky and complex story, and Bartlett does a great job of unpicking what on earth is really going on. Buried There are two inescapable reasons to dive into one of the most significant podcast releases of the year. First, its staggering revelations about organised crime infiltrating the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rubbish disposal industry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and illegally dumping astonishing quantities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c make it a must-listen for anyone with the slightest interest in the environment. Second, the deathbed confessions, the cover-ups, the awful visits to the Northern Irish Mobuoy site at the centre of the scandal and the interview with the Italian priest who now lives under armed guard aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just gripping material. They all come in episodes that are only 15 minutes long. Cotton Capital The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s landmark series on its \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Manchester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c links to slavery has been a huge undertaking and clearly a labour of love for the team of journalists who worked on it. Maya Wolfe-Robinson, the project\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s editor, also helms much of this striking six-part series. It features contributions from the likes of Dr Cassandra Gooptar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who worked for two years to unpick the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s connections to slavery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pioneering TV journalist turned reparations campaigner Barbara Makeda Blake-Hannah, and Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner. Educating Daisy A podcast hosted by Daisy May Cooper was always going to be a riotously entertaining affair. But the comics who pitch classic novels to Cooper (who has supposedly never read one) make it double fun. From Cooper haranguing Diane Morgan for boring her with talk of social justice (you instantly know she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t read The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists) to hysterically giggling over Jamali Maddix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s description of graphic novel Preacher, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like listening to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most amusingly unreceptive audience. But its spirit is best summed up by Cooper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words to Tim Key, when \u00e2\u20ac\u201c during a digression from his pitch for comic masterpiece The Diary of a Nobody \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he mentions offhand enjoying The Catcher in the Rye due to its brevity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well why didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you bring that in?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Filthy Ritual True-crime podcasters Suruthi Bala and Hannah Maguire were used to flitting between cases for their hit show RedHanded, but Filthy Ritual has seen them drill down into just one: the bizarre, disturbing story of Juliette D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Souza. How did this super-prolific \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shaman\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd manage to embezzle half of Hampstead for millions of pounds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially when she was running not one, but two, different types of scam at the same time? Thrilling listening, which paints a vivid picture of its audacious real-life villain. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Not a Monster: The Shamima Begum Story The story of Shamima Begum, the Bethnal Green teenager who left London to join Islamic State in 2015, has long been framed as one of radicalisation and callous extremism \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least by the UK government, who revoked her citizenship in 2019. The host of this award-winning BBC/PBS podcast, Josh Baker, speaks to the woman herself, in what is an eye-opening look at Begum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motivations, the harsh realities of her life in Syria \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and whether she can ever be forgiven. Love, Janessa Catfishing stories never fail to shock, but the scale of this one makes jaws drop. Janessa Brazil is a successful adult entertainment star, but stolen photos have also made her the face and body of a global romance catfishing scheme. Does she know about this? How do the catfishers get away with using her identity? And just how many people have been scammed? In this in-depth investigation of the scandal, Hannah Ajala speaks to people who have lost millions and had hopes of new relationships shattered. Northern News Dead dogs reappearing to their owners in bath mats! A husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infidelity announced to the world via the medium of balloon! A schoolgirl who spilled some food colouring! Northerners Amy Gledhill and Ian Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hilarious look at news from the north of England is an unfailingly fun jaunt through local journalism with celebrity guests such as Tim Key, Rosie Jones and Phil Wang. Hardly surprising, given that it comes from the same stable as long-running hits Off Menu and Cuddle Club. Pod Save the UK It can be hard to cut through the noise of political talk in the pod-sphere, but this UK version of Pod Save America genuinely sounds fresh. That is of course thanks to its hosts: political satirist Nish Kumar and the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Coco Khan. The pals flit between conversations about Eurovision, the immigration bill, Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 concerts, the housing crisis and everything in between, depending on what everyone is talking about in a given week, just as you would with (very politically engaged and articulate) friends. Rylan: How to Be a Man Rylan annually rewatches the moment he got through to the X Factor live shows; a big heap of shrieking tears in judge Nicole Scherzinger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home (he was incredibly hungover, apparently). He does this to remind himself of how much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all of this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means to him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and oh how far he has come since then. Securing his status as a national sweetheart, in this thoughtful podcast we hear his warmth, intelligence and wit as he asks a lineup of diverse guests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Amir Khan, Hamza Yassin, Janet Street-Porter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what it means to be a man in the modern world. And because this is lovely Rylan, they easily open up. Terri White: Finding Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ghost Children Terri White\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s captivating series about the thousands of children who are missing from school in the UK isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an easy listen. The opening episode about Arthur Labinjo-Hughes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death is devastating. But it sparks White\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into how we can try to protect children like Arthur in the future.

But the vibrations delivered by this device will not alert you to a new message or that you have hit your daily step goal. Neither are they strictly intended for your wrist. Welcome to the future of vibrators, designed not only for sexual pleasure, but to tackle medical problems such as vaginal dryness, or a painful and inflamed prostate gland in men. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The current standard of care if you go to a therapist, gynaecologist or urologist, is they will insert one or two fingers to reach the painful areas and massage them to alleviate the pain,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Soumyadip Rakshit, CEO and co-founder of sex-tech company MysteryVibe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We bring together the best of biomedical engineering to recreate what currently works, so people can access these therapies easily, discreetly and cost effectively.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MysteryVibe is not the only company that is striving to alter our relationship with sex toys. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smart vibrator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd developed by the US-based startup Lioness contains sensors that measure women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pelvic floor movements, allowing them to track how their arousal and orgasms may be changing over time or in response to stress or alcohol. An \u00e2\u20ac\u0153erection ring\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd developed by US company FirmTech claims to enhance men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance while tracking the duration and turgidity of their erections and the number of nocturnal episodes they experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an indicator of cardiovascular health. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are a number of different products that are now sort of skirting the line between pleasure and health,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dr Rachel Rubin, a urologist and sexual medicine specialist based in Washington DC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These companies today are focusing on [pelvic] anatomy and physiology, and using what we know to try to enhance pleasure, joy, intimacy and fun.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MysteryVibe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s laboratory \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the only facility conducting vibrator research and development within the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is incongruously housed in a former dairy in a rural business park near Guildford, Surrey. The first clue that this is no standard office unit is an issue of Playboy tucked behind a magazine about technology startups. Then I spot a tray of wand-shaped mechanical devices, in various states of undress, their bright components resembling children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Duplo blocks. These are stripped-back Crescendo vibrators, MysteryVibe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original product, which was designed to target and release tender areas inside the vagina and alleviate pelvic pain, for example in women whose pelvic floor muscles have been damaged as a result of childbirth. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The simple answer to pelvic pain is physiotherapy. But most mums either are unaware of this, or don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the time and/or money to pay for it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Soumyadip said. Registered as medical devices, and marketed at scientific conferences, such products are a far cry from the oversized dildos traditionally stocked by sex shops. MysteryVibe is even funding research to back up their scientific claims. Preliminary results from a small trial involving 11 women with genito-pelvic pain or penetration disorder \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where the muscles around the vagina contract whenever an attempt is made to penetrate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c suggested that using the Crescendo device three times a week for 12 weeks resulted in significant improvement. Larger randomised trials are needed. But other scientific evidence supports the use of vibrators in various female health conditions too. According to a recent review by Dr Alexandra Dubinskaya, a urologist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and colleagues, they can improve pelvic floor muscle function, facilitate the treatment of vulvar pain and enhance women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sexual experiences. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know that vibration causes vasodilation, meaning the vessels that bring blood to the organs get wider and can bring more blood. It also promotes neuromodulation, meaning it can retrain the nerves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially those nerves responsible for pain perception,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dubinskaya said. Such products are also finding favour with pelvic health physiotherapists such as Katlyn Nasseri at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, US. She said that people experience pelvic pain due to overactive muscles, stress, anxiety, conditions such as endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, and childbirth injuries. Trauma or inflammation can cause the pelvic floor muscles to become overly toned, resulting in pain. Nasseri likens using a vibrator to using a massage gun to relieve stiff muscles elsewhere in the body: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vibration is great for muscles; it helps them to relax really well. The same principle applies to the muscles of the pelvis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MysteryVibe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest products, scheduled for release later this year, are a vulval vibrator for women experiencing vaginal dryness and/or low libido, and a prostate vibrator designed to be inserted into the anus to relieve pain in men with inflamed prostate glands. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The three common things that happen to men are that the prostate becomes larger as they become older, or it gets a cancer, and the third is prostatitis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c inflammation, pain or infection in the prostate gland. Of these, perhaps the most difficult to treat is prostatitis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Prokar Dasgupta, a professor of urology and MysteryVibe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s medical director. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the treatments is regularly massaging the prostate. This allows the congealed secretions inside the prostate that are the cause of the problem to come out. Rather than a urologist doing this manually, it can be done by the patient themselves using this device.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Men also have pelvic floor muscles and can hold tension in them, just like women, said Rubin: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This can cause symptoms such as urinary frequency or urgency, pain with ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or premature or delayed orgasm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition, the prostate is very rich with nerves and pleasure spots that can really aid in orgasm and arousal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MysteryVibe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vulval vibrator is designed to sit outside the body, can be moulded to a woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physiological dimensions, and can even be worn during intercourse. Whether it actually counters menopause-related dryness or reduced libido is as yet unproven, but menopause expert Dr Shahzadi Harper of The Harper Clinic in London suspects it might. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We often say use it or lose it, but when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling tired, when your hormones change, when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got so many other things going on, sex can slip down the sort of priority list. This is a nice gentle way to get confidence back in your body, reignite those nerve endings and boost blood flow to the clitoris and pelvic area, which stimulates the cells that help with lubrication.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dr Paula Briggs, chair elect of the British Menopause Society and a consultant in sexual and reproductive health at Liverpool Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NHS Foundation Trust, said that a vulval vibrator could stimulate collagen-producing cells in the vaginal wall to become active again, reversing some of the thinning that occurs following menopause. Although regular sex can achieve a similar thing, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the difference with a vibrator is that the woman is in control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She now advises patients to experiment with a small, tapered vibrator because penetration can be difficult, and often very painful, for such women. Briggs cautioned that vibrator use alone was unlikely to combat vaginal dryness in women whose arousal issues stem from psychological causes, including physical or emotional trauma or stress. Kate Walsh, physiotherapy lead at Liverpool Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hospital, agreed. Combined with other techniques such as mindfulness and breathing exercises, a vibrator can help women to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reprogram\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the way their bodies process sensation, helping to make sex pleasurable again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Women will come in with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spent money on, but if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand the context of why they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing this, it is unlikely to work,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying that someone who is struggling with pain or arousal needs to jump straight into psychosexual counselling, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to understand that what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feeding it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always just a physical thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the physical and psychological interact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/09/facebook-owner-to-push-ahead-plans-launch-twitter-rival-meta-oprah-winfrey", "primaryCategory": "technology", "title": "Facebook owner to push ahead with plans to launch Twitter rival", "lead": "Meta targeting Oprah Winfrey and Dalai Lama as potential users of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsanely run\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 social networking platform", "author": "Dan Milmo Global technology editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:59:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896600", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c98defa2ad44cd45630475e75424b1340ddb36ac/522_651_3498_2098/500.jpg", "body": "Mark Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Meta is pushing ahead with plans to launch a rival to Twitter because public figures reportedly want a similar platform that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sanely run\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the Dalai Lama and Oprah Winfrey on the target list for users. The standalone app is codenamed Project93 and its public name could be Threads, according to a report by the tech news site the Verge. The report said Meta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief product officer, Chris Cox, told an internal meeting on Thursday that the app was the Facebook and Instagram owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153response to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been hearing from creators and public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run, that they believe that they can trust and rely upon for distribution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cox was quoted as saying, in an apparent reference to the management of Twitter under Elon Musk. Cox reportedly said Meta was in discussions with Winfrey, who has more 42 million followers on Twitter, and the Dalai Lama, who has nearly 19 million, to be potential users, adding that coding for the app began in January and it would be made available \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as soon as we can\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Verge said the app would integrate with ActivityPub, a technology that also underpins Mastodon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Twitter rival that is a decentralised collection of thousands of sites \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and allows social networks to be interoperable. In theory, this would allow users of the new Meta app to take their accounts and followers to apps supported by ActivityPub, such as Mastodon. According to earlier reports, the app will be based on Instagram and users will be able to sign in with their Instagram username and password, with their followers, user bio and verification transferring over to the new app. Cox said the app was aiming for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safety, ease of use, reliability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and giving creators a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable place to build and grow their audiences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A screenshot of the app published by the Verge showed a similar interface to Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, with blue ticks, profile pics and like, reply and retweet buttons. Twitter has had a tumultuous time under Musk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership, although the Tesla boss has insisted the platform\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s userbase has not declined since he bought the business in October. Musk claimed weeks after buying Twitter that daily active user numbers had reached an all-time high of more than 250 million. However, Twitter is experiencing financial problems as an advertising-reliant business. An advertiser boycott was triggered by concerns including the deterioration of moderation standards at the platform and a botched relaunch of Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subscription service, which led to a slew of verified impersonator accounts. The New York Times reported on Monday that Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ad revenues in the first week of May were 59% down on the same period last year, reflecting concerns about the platform. Last month, Twitter appointed Linda Yaccarino, a TV advertising executive from NBCUniversal, as its new chief executive. Meta declined to comment.

At the time it was estimated that 3,000 American children were being induced by said companies to start smoking every day. Last Monday, the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Panorama programme came close to repeating that scene with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food manufacturers. The products at issue are ultra-processed foods (UPF). Their makers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 denial of the harm these products may cause is as adamant as those tobacco execs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 once was, and the consequences could be equally lethal. As the amount of UPF we eat rises, so do rates of cancer and diabetes. Riddled with additives that are crammed into tiny print on the sides of packs, such food constitutes 57% of Britons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 energy intake. This is the highest in Europe, comparing with 14% in France and 13% in Italy. Being overweight or obese affects 63% of adults in England, among the highest percentage in Europe. There now appears to be incontrovertible evidence that such a diet heightens the risk not just of diabetes and cancer but cardiovascular disease and dementia. I have in front of me four books on the subject, all just published and, I am told, widely read. They are Henry Dimbleby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ravenous, Chris van Tulleken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ultra-Processed People, Tim Spector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Food for Life and Kimberley Wilson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Unprocesssed. All say the same thing unequivocally about UPF. The epidemiologist Spector is blunt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a timebomb, a disaster, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re walking into it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Added to Panorama, that makes four readings and a funeral. Panorama charted research into emulsifiers, sweeteners such as aspartame and a chemical, PBA, that leaches from plastic containers. In an uncanny replay of the tobacco saga, the programme revealed that while independent research reviewed by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Food Standards Agency (FSA) was overwhelmingly alarming, evidence gathered on the other side was somehow funded by the companies themselves. More glaring was that half the professional members of the committee on toxicity, which provides advice to the FSA, had past or present links to advising food companies. This crucial committee had apparently not advocated banning any food additives in Britain for the past 10 years. The Panorama documentary did not cover the no-less-vexed issue of trans fats, a food ingredient now banned by many countries, including by the US Food and Drug Administration, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not generally recognised as safe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is estimated that 90,000 Americans a year have been spared an early death as a result of this ban. In 2010, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then health minister, Andrew Lansley, refused to ban them. (Both he and his special adviser, it was revealed by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, had worked for public relations companies that had represented the food industry.) The nearest a British government has come to action on diet is the modest tax on sugared drinks introduced by David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government in 2016. However sceptical we may be of apocalyptic hysteria, to neglect so glaring a failure of preventive care seems mad. This is not a nanny state issue. It is more like making seatbelts voluntary or encouraging smoking in schools. Ultra-processing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c making food last longer or feeding a craving for more \u00e2\u20ac\u201c clearly raises the risk of chronic illness. Health treatment in Britain is under severe strain. Yet the courses of action that may diminish the strain, quite apart from averting chronic sickness, is handicapped by government succumbing to the persistence of self-interested lobby groups. All are now emboldened in a post-Brexit environment where the calls are for less not more regulation. Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health outcomes are passing from a national shame to a scandal. These studies show that the fault \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what separates Britain from most comparable systems abroad \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not the state of its health service but rather the state of its national diet. If nothing else makes this point, it is that the healthy life expectancy of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorest people diverges more sharply from that of richer people than in almost any major OECD country. So, too, diverges the intake of ultra-processed food. There should be a mass campaign against ultra-processing. Campaigners such as Jamie Oliver and Henry Dimbleby have been crying out in this wilderness for years. As long as this continues, there is no way the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physical and mental health will improve and no way to rescue the NHS.

Rice will be allowed to leave, with Arsenal his likeliest destination, and replacing him will be one of David Moyes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest challenges. West Ham, who are also in pole position to bolster their attack by signing Harvey Barnes from Leicester, are expected to target two central midfielders. Moyes is keen on James Ward-Prowse, who will leave Southampton after their relegation from the Premier League, and West Ham are also considering a move for \u00c3\ufffdlvarez. Ajax are prepared to sell the Mexico international, the subject of a bid from Chelsea last summer, and want \u00c2\u00a340m plus \u00c2\u00a35m in add-ons. West Ham are looking to negotiate a lower fee for \u00c3\ufffdlvarez, who has extensive Champions League experience, and that could hurt their chances of signing him. They risk missing out on the 25-year-old to Borussia Dortmund, who have money to spend after agreeing to sell Jude Bellingham to Real Madrid for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac103m (\u00c2\u00a388.5m) plus add-ons that could reach about another \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30m. West Ham hope Ajax settle for less after missing out on Champions League qualification. Jo\u00c3\u00a3o Palhinha is an alternative midfield option for West Ham but the Portugal international would not be cheap after impressing since joining Fulham for \u00c2\u00a320m last summer. There is an obvious appeal to Ward-Prowse because of the England international\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Premier League experience and set-piece prowess. West Ham, who qualified for the Europa League by winning the Europa Conference League, know it will take more than one player to fill the gap left by Rice. West Ham want at least \u00c2\u00a3100m for their captain, who is being targeted by Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Newcastle and Manchester United. Arsenal hope to pay about \u00c2\u00a390m. Part of West Ham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning will be informed by the reality that Rice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence was not enough to stop them struggling in midfield this season. Moyes looked for upgrades on Tomas Soucek last summer but the Czech Republic midfielder, who lacks poise in possession, is still a key player. Soucek, who is a goal threat, started alongside Rice when West Ham beat Fiorentina in the Conference League final.

Trump is expected to surrender himself to authorities in Miami on Tuesday at 3pm, although the exact charges he will face are still unclear as the seven-count indictment remains under seal. On Fox News Digital on Thursday night he said he would plead not guilty. After news of the indictment broke, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies rallied to his defense as the US braced for the unprecedented spectacle of a former president forced to defend himself against federal criminal charges. The development comes just two months after Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in an unrelated case over hush-money payments during the 2016 election. The charges filed by the office of special counsel Jack Smith in federal district court in Miami include the willful retention of national defense information, obstruction of justice, conspiracy, false statements and concealment under title 18 of the US criminal code, according to a person familiar with the matter. Smith, appointed by the attorney general, Merrick Garland, has been investigating for more than a year whether Trump knowingly retained classified information at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and attempted to conceal those documents from the justice department after authorities issued a subpoena for their return. Trump himself confirmed the indictment in a Thursday evening post on his social media platform Truth Social, writing: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is indeed a DARK DAY for the United States of America.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a video posted to the platform shortly afterwards, Trump denied any culpability and lashed out against his political rivals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am an innocent man,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said in the video. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I did nothing wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Though the exact nature of the charges remained unclear, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican allies on Capitol Hill quickly rallied to his defense, attacking the investigation as a case of political persecution. Many Republicans raced to note that Joe Biden is also under investigation by a special counsel over the alleged mishandling of classified papers, but they neglected to mention that Trump, unlike Biden, received a subpoena for classified documents amid concerns that he had willfully withheld some materials from federal authorities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today is indeed a dark day for the United States of America,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House speaker, said on Twitter on Thursday evening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I, and every American who believes in the rule of law, stand with President Trump against this grave injustice. House Republicans will hold this brazen weaponization of power accountable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most competitive rival for the Republican ticket, Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida, also denounced the justice department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weaponization of federal law enforcement represents a mortal threat to a free society,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have for years witnessed an uneven application of the law depending upon political affiliation. Why so zealous in pursuing Trump yet so passive about Hillary or Hunter?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weaponization of federal law enforcement represents a mortal threat to a free society.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Democrats viewed the news as confirmation that authorities were again seeking to hold Trump accountable for his illegal actions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apparent indictment on multiple charges arising from his retention of classified materials is another affirmation of the rule of law,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat of California, said on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For four years, he acted like he was above the law. But he should be treated like any other lawbreaker. And today, he has been.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The latest indictment means Trump will face charges in at least two jurisdictions as he seeks to return to the White House next year. Trump continues to lead in polls of the Republican primary field, even after he was indicted in the hush-money case earlier this year. As of now, there is no sign that Republican primary voters are prepared to abandon Trump en masse, despite his many legal liabilities. The country will soon find out if the threat of a federal conviction is enough to rob Trump of his status as the frontrunner in the Republican primary.

Donald Trump just became the first former president in American history to face federal criminal charges. On Thursday night it emerged that Trump had been indicted for allegedly mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. He has reportedly been charged with seven counts including wilfully retaining national defence secrets in violation of the Espionage Act, making false statements and an obstruction of justice conspiracy. He is due in court in Miami, Florida, on Tuesday afternoon after most likely surrendering himself to the FBI there. It is often tempting to hype every Trump drama out of proportion and then lose sight of when something genuinely monumental has happened. Thursday night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action by the justice department was genuinely monumental. First, it raises the question: what was Trump doing with government secrets? It was reported last month that prosecutors obtained an audio recording in which Trump talks about holding on to a classified Pentagon document related to a potential attack on Iran. Second, Trump could soon join a notorious club that includes Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Nicolas Sarkozy and Jacques Chirac of France and Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. All have been prosecuted and convicted of corruption in the past 15 years. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest stress test for American democracy: can the state hold a former president accountable and apply the rule of law? There was a near miss for Richard Nixon, who could have faced federal charges over Watergate but was pardoned by his successor, Gerald Ford. The White House knows it cannot afford to put a foot wrong. Joe Biden tries to avoid commenting on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s myriad legal troubles. The attorney general, Merrick Garland, has also kept them at arm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s length by appointing Jack Smith as special counsel. It is Smith who investigated the Mar-a-Lago documents case. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an overreaching prosecutor. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very rigorous and vigorous and independent and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what you want here and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Merrick Garland had anything to do with it except appointing him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But what of the Republican party? Did it solemnly accept news of the indictment and call on Americans to allow justice to take its course? Did the Trump fever finally break, with party leaders denouncing the old demagogue and ushering in a new era? It did not. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is unconscionable for a President to indict the leading candidate opposing him,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tweeted Kevin McCarthy, speaker of the House of Representatives. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I, and every American who believes in the rule of law, stand with President Trump against this grave injustice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida and chief rival to Trump in the Republican presidential primary election, wrote on Twitter: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weaponization of federal law enforcement represents a mortal threat to a free society \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Why so zealous in pursuing Trump yet so passive about Hillary or Hunter?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Senator JD Vance of Ohio described it as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sham indictment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee compared the US to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153banana republic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri told Fox News, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if the president in power can just jail his political opponents, which is what Joe Biden is trying to do tonight, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a republic any more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s base will be equally unmoved. They will swallow his claim of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153election interference\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by his enemies. They will say both Biden and former vice-president Mike Pence were also caught with classified documents while forgetting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or wilfully ignoring \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that Biden and Pence complied with the authorities while Trump allegedly obstructed justice. They will also point to House Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 increasingly noisy bribery allegations against Biden and his family (for which they have provided no evidence) as proof of a double standard. A Fox News interview with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene was accompanied by the chyron: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump indicted on same day Burisma scandal potentially confirmed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the word potentially doing an awful lot of work. In short, this is less a gamechanger than a replay of less than three months ago when Trump was charged by state prosecutors in New York with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records over a hush money payment to an adult film star. The former president saturated the news cycle, enjoyed a boost in the polls and forced his primary rivals to rally around him. He raised more than $4m in the 24 hours after the indictment became public. The same rinse, repeat cycle seems likely if and when Trump is hit by even more charges over the January 6 insurrection and election tampering in Georgia. But there is a sense of gathering momentum, as the electoral calendar and legal calendar hurtle towards a great collision. Could Trump accept the Republican nomination while wearing an ankle bracelet? Could he run against Biden from a prison cell? Could the American presidency become the ultimate get-out-of-jail card? Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jokey speculation has a habit of becoming tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headline news."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/seismic-data-adds-evidence-ukraine-kakhovka-dam-blown-up", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Seismic data adds to evidence that Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kakhovka dam was blown up", "lead": "Signals point to explosion early on Tuesday, as Ukraine says intercepted call proves Russia was responsible", "author": "Julian Borger in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:31:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896623", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5a505e9ab4db03a4ba653e540e150cdb93f2a658/0_191_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Evidence is growing that the Nova Kakhovka dam was blown up, after the publication of seismic data showing there was a blast at the site in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Norsar, the Norwegian Seismic Array, said signals from a regional station in Romania pointed to an explosion at 2.54am. Norsar did not draw conclusions on who was responsible. The Ukrainian government has said Russian occupying forces had control of the hydroelectric infrastructure on top of the dam and were using it as a garrison at the time of the blast. Explosive experts have said it would be much easier to blow up the dam from within than by firing on it from a distance. On Friday morning, the Ukrainian security service published what it claimed was an intercepted phone call proving Russian responsibility for blowing up the dam on Tuesday. The SBU posted a recording of a 90-second telephone conversation on the Telegram social media app, and claimed it was between two \u00e2\u20ac\u0153occupiers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the word normally used by Ukrainian officials for Russian soldiers. The two men discuss the destruction of the dam, and one of them assumes it was carried out by Ukrainians but the other speaker corrects him, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our guys did it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our saboteur group is there. They wanted to cause fear with this dam. It did not go according to the plan. More than they planned,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the speaker said. The authenticity of the call could not be verified. The SBU statement does not identify the speakers, nor does it indicate the time or place the call was supposed to have taken place. An SBU source said the call was intercepted on Thursday and that more details could not be provided as the recording was part of a criminal investigation. Ukrainian officials have expressed frustration that Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account of the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destruction, that it was blown up from inside by Russian forces, has not so far been confirmed by US, UK or other intelligence agencies. Ihor Syrota, the director general of the Ukrainian hydroelectric power company Ukrhydroenergo, dismissed suggestions the dam could have been destroyed as result of Ukrainian shelling or catastrophic structural failure as Russian propaganda. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The plant was designed to withstand a nuclear strike,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Syrota told the Guardian in an interview in Kyiv. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To destroy the plant from the outside, at least three aircraft bombs, each of 500kg, would have had to be dropped on the same spot. The station was blown up from the inside.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They brought hundreds of kilograms of explosives there. Ukraine reported last year that the station was mined. The Russians were just waiting for the right day to blow it up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd President Volodymyr Zelenskiy held an online meeting with environmental activists from around the world to establish an expert group to rally international support to help recover from the ecological disaster caused by the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destruction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tens of thousands of birds and at least 20,000 wild animals are at risk of death,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously, the Kakhovka reservoir has been turned into a huge graveyard for millions of living beings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said it was becoming a global problem as contaminated flood waters flowed into the Black Sea. In his nightly video address, recorded on a train after a visit to the flood zone, Zelenskiy thanked Ukrainian troops and repeated Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earlier claims of military success around the city of Bakhmut. But he did not discuss the southern front, which so far appears to be the main focus of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerging counteroffensive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see every detail. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not time to talk about it today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said battles on the southern front were continuing for the settlement of Velyka Novosilka and that Russian troops were mounting an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153active defence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the town of Orikhiv. Russian official sources and military bloggers reported intense fighting overnight and early on Friday morning around Orikhiv, south-east of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia.

Now a new recruit has joined the lineup: the personal tailor. Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 is said to have hired 12 to work backstage on her costumes during her London Renaissance shows, while Stormzy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stylist Melissa Holdbrook-Akposoe told GQ the rapper won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wear anything without it being tailored to his 6ft 5in frame, describing it as now a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-negotiable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Meanwhile, magazine editors are finding more and more A-listers arrive at shoots with their own tailor to ensure off-the-peg looks are perfected. Lately, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s begun to trickle down from Hollywood to the high street. Influencers now caveat shopping haul try-ons with a disclaimer that they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken the pieces to their tailor, while alterations app Sojo has had to hire additional tailors to work at its Selfridges pop-up, pictured below (in the first week alone, orders were up 147%). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re extremely busy at the moment. We get a lot of calls and people dropping in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Romeo Nzuzi, who works at his family-run business, No One Famous Tailoring, in London. Alongside the usual requests for wedding-guest outfits, there is high demand for blazers, jeans and shorts. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-documented that sizing on the high street is a bit of a guessing game, with discrepancies from piece to piece and retailer to retailer. You could slide into a pair of size 12 trousers at Arket, but in Zara struggle to get a pair with the same-sized tag past your thighs. As a result, tailors report that customers are buying the next size up and then altering pieces to fit their actual frame. Fashion trends are also impacting demand. As fast fashion brands churn out blazers with exaggerated shoulders, and low-slung billowing trousers, consumers are finding themselves swamped in fabric. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine line between an oversized fit and looking like a child playing dress up in their parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wardrobe. A bespoke suit remains aspirational for many people. But as an alternative, some consumers are happy to buy a low-priced and low-quality suit (co-ordinated two pieces start from \u00c2\u00a320 at Boohoo and \u00c2\u00a370 at Zara), then spend anywhere from \u00c2\u00a310 to have the sleeves shortened to \u00c2\u00a345 to have the jacket adjusted to their body shape. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the fit that is usually off,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Nzuzi. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those pieces are designed with a one-size-fits-all approach, but everyone is built differently. People want to feel good in their clothes so we give things an extra tweak to perfect them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sizing that runs from XS to XL is limiting,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Carol Ai, a New York tailor who works with celebrities such as Cardi B and Olivia Rodrigo. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Someone could have a larger chest or smaller hips. Someone might like something to fit tight at the waist, others prefer it looser. It all comes down to personal preference.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While many limit tailoring to shortening hems and nipping in waists, Nzuzi has used TikTok to show just how expansive a tailor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skillset is. His videos of tailoring streetwear pieces such as North Face puffer jackets and streamlining Nike tracksuits have gone viral, attracting a whole new generation to the Leyton-based shop where he works alongside his mum. However, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just about downsizing pieces. A tailor can also increase the size of an item that may be too small. Nzuzi has turned skinny jeans into straight-leg ones, while Ai regularly tweaks typically small sample-sized pieces to fit her clients. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I might have to add in a panel, or if something is too long and small, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll shorten the hem and then use that fabric to add extra room around the hip,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. While it is customary for stylists to use claw clips to temporarily hold pieces in place on set, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now becoming more common for them to work closely with a tailor during shoots. Ai regularly finds herself flying at short notice from New York to Los Angeles to adjust pieces for Cardi B and her husband, the rapper Offset. Even their children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clothes are altered. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A stylist will source the clothes and then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll work through the night to do the adjustments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she explains.

In a letter to the Tories, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, Anneliese Dodds, called on the party to justify donations of almost \u00c2\u00a37.5m that she said had come from people and firms who had had links to business in Russia. Labour renewed its attack on the Conservatives over donations after the Tories criticised its acceptance of \u00c2\u00a31.5m from Dale Vince, the founder of the energy company Ecotricity who also funds the campaign group Just Stop Oil. Labour drew particular attention to Mansour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-ownership of Mantrac, which earlier this week still appeared to have a Russian-language website advertising its services as an authorised dealer of Caterpillar hardware and equipment, with 14 offices in the country. Mantrac said in May that it was winding down its business in Russia, more than a year after Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine drew international condemnation and calls from Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson for businesses to withdraw. The website was taken down on Wednesday, and it is understood Mantrac\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations in the country were fully suspended in May. Dodds said it had been brought to her attention that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Conservative party senior treasurer Mohamed Mansour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firm is operating a Russian-language website\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and questioned his previous financial ties to Russia \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at a time when the UK is rightly imposing sanctions on the Putin regime and the prime minister has repeatedly called on British companies to pull out of Russia in order to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcinflict maximum economic pain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Mansour revealed last month that he was giving \u00c2\u00a35m to the Conservatives, the largest donation to the party since Sir Paul Getty in 2001. Mantrac said it was winding down its business in Russia at about the same time. In her letter, Dodds said the Conservative chair, Greg Hands, should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get a grip\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the flow of donations from people with links to Russia. She said public confidence in politics and politicians depended on parties \u00e2\u20ac\u0153doing the right thing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and she urged him to explain what due diligence had been done on Mansour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s donation. She wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rishi Sunak promised a government of professionalism, integrity and accountability. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to put his money where his mouth is. At a time when public confidence in politicians has been damaged by Conservative scandal after Conservative scandal, it is vitally important that the party comes clean on these donations and returns them in full.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour has also renewed calls for the Conservatives to give more than \u00c2\u00a32m in donations they have received since 2007 to charity because they came from the wife of a former deputy finance minister in Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia. Lubov Chernukhin has also been a member of the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 leaders group of top donors who give at least \u00c2\u00a350,000 a year to the party, and a member of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advisory board of super-rich donors. A spokesperson for the Chernukhins said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Neither Lubov nor her husband, Vladimir Chernukhin, support, or have ever supported, the policies of Putin. Mr Chernukhin was appointed as deputy minister of finance by prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov and formed part of his government for two years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr Kasyanov was dismissed by President Putin in 2004 due to significant disagreements on policy. He has since become one of the leading critics of President Putin and an opposition leader. Shortly after Mr Kasyanov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firing, Mr Chernukhin was dismissed and subsequently had to leave the country. In the 19 years since, he has never returned to Russia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a British citizen, Mrs Chernukhin is entitled to make donations to political parties based on her personal wealth as she sees fit; any suggestion to the contrary is patently xenophobic. Her donations to the Conservative party have been declared in accordance with the rules of the Electoral Commission.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Conservative party source said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is rich coming from Dodds who sat next to Corbyn as he slagged off British intelligence when a chemical weapons attack took place on British soil. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour are clearly rattled by the exposing of their shadowy relationships with eco-zealots. They are so deep into the pockets of Just Stop Oil that they have the criminal group writing their energy policy for them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Conservatives have been approached for comment."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/09/groundhog-day-review-old-vic-london-tim-minchin", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Groundhog Day review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stellar set, score and performances are guaranteed entertainment", "lead": "A revival of the musical at the same venue where it premiered combines clever staging, impeccable performances and Tim Minchin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lyrical brilliance into a reassuringly familiar and enjoyable package", "author": "Arifa Akbar", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:27:21Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896634", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d7b96ad446f13dea58fc70d0f2fcf4f3f3cb29c4/0_160_2400_1440/500.jpg", "body": "This musical, of a man trapped inside one day on repeat, runs the risk of living its own groundhog day. It will be familiar to many from the Bill Murray film on which it is based, and also from its original run, seven years ago at the same theatre. The story of arrogant TV weatherman Phil Connors (Andy Karl), who gets stuck in backwater America reporting on an annual \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Groundhog Day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd event, is indubitably a throwback: even its book is written by the screenwriter of the 1993 film, Danny Rubin. The big surprise is that it still lifts us with its comedy, and thrills us with its theatrical invention. So much of that is down to Tim Minchin. His music is fine if relentless, with songs coming thick and fast at first, none of the tunes memorable. But his lyrics are a blast, zinging with clever, quick wit. The show glows with bursts of comic brilliance as a result, and slightly better songs in the second half, such as Playing Nancy (sung by Eve Norris), about the woes of being a single, small-town woman, and If I Had My Time Again. There is also a bewitching performance from Karl, reprising the role of the anchorman, who really is a throwback to another era. Karl makes a more predatory Phil than Murray did, with impeccable comic timing. Tanisha Spring is winning as his producer, Rita, and their spiky chemistry fuels the romance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They told me he was an asshole \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she sings. Directed by Matthew Warchus, who also worked with Minchin on Matilda, the production uses overt, flamboyant theatricality to its advantage. Rob Howell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set creates the hallucinatory effect of a recurring dream, with 19th-century troupes in top hats and a high-kicking band with pompoms (choreography by Lizzi Gee). Howell uses miniaturisation to brilliant effect too: a drunken late-night car ride goes from a life-size chase on stage to an aerial view with model cars. Rubin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story has a thudding moral lesson at its core \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it a wonderful life when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a good person?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is neither deep nor convincing. Phil becomes boringly vanilla after going through his entertaining cycles of hedonism and hopelessness, so it is an achievement that Karl keeps us on his side. Rather like the Old Vic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s returning production of A Christmas Carol, this revival is hardly daring programming. But it is guaranteed entertainment and will no doubt get bums on seats. A comfy pair of slippers then, but ones we enjoy slipping into. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At the Old Vic, London, until 19 August"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/09/sheikh-jassim-manchester-united-deadline", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Sheikh Jassim will not end Manchester United interest if his deadline passes", "lead": "Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final bid for Manchester United will remain live even if the Glazers fail to respond to it on Friday", "author": "Jamie Jackson", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:14:49Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896637", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ef31383a8ab7aa63af703eda96e76e59a9b3f987/43_0_1200_720/500.jpg", "body": "Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al-Thani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final bid of no more than \u00c2\u00a36bn for Manchester United will remain live even if the Glazers fail to respond to it by the Qatari\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s self-imposed deadline of Friday. The banker and his advisers have become frustrated by a process that began when United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s American owners put the club up for potential sale in November and that has led him to make five offers. On Wednesday the Guardian was told this had moved Sheikh Jassim to decide that Friday was the endpoint for any engagement and that he would walk away if his bid was not accepted. It has now emerged that this will not be the case. One possibility regarding Sheikh Jassim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultimatum is that he fears losing out to Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the only other publicly declared bidder who wishes to purchase a controlling interest in United, and so the improved offer was a final attempt to become proprietor. Ratcliffe, the Ineos owner, wants to acquire about 51% of United and potentially leave one or more of the Glazers with a minority share. Ineos has reportedly been in talks with the Glazers over the structure of such an agreement but it is understood the company does not believe a deal is imminent."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/09/digested-week-a-beer-with-mike-pence-to-figure-out-what-his-deal-is-possibly-", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Digested week: A beer with Mike Pence to figure out what his deal is?

Trump is not, weirdly, at the top of this list, since when he cares to use it one knows his charm is considerable. Mike Pence, who declared his candidacy on Monday and remains enduringly weird, would definitely break the top three, although a small part of me would like to take a crack, over a beer, at figuring out what his deal is. The former vice-president and evangelical Christian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very clenched personality and eagerness to be photographed at the weekend in leathers on a Harley-Davidson, is suggestive of a range of possibilities. Also throwing his hat into the ring this week is Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and, for my money, the least appealing candidate in the current Republican lineup, even taking into account Ron DeSantis. Christie, you may remember, was for a hot minute in 2016 spoken of as a credible centrist Republican before everyone remembered who he was. (My favourite Christie story is the one from 2017 when he was snapped from a news helicopter enjoying a deserted beach with his family during a state-wide shutdown when the beaches were closed.) In the years since, he has flip-flopped between craven appeasement and condemnation of Trump and is now running \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hollow laugh \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as a moral standard-bearer on the strength of his objection to the events surrounding the storming of the US Capitol on January 6. Other candidates in the race include the requisite comedy multimillionaire who has never held office \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in this case, the former pharmaceutical company CEO Vivek Ramaswamy whose manifesto seems to be the single word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-woke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a lone woman, Nikki Haley, the former governor of South Carolina.

There are reasons to dislike Haley (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153America is not racist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) as strong as any triggered by the rest of the field, but assuredly, that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t one of them. Tuesday As hot takes continue to fly around in the wake of Hannah Gadsby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disastrous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (ARTnews), \u00e2\u20ac\u0153silly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (New York Times) curated exhibition about Picasso at the Brooklyn Museum, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turn instead to Fran\u00c3\u00a7oise Gilot, whose death at the age of 101 was announced on Tuesday. Gilot was an artist, an icon in her own right and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no avoiding her connection to the man, although it was the source of career-long irritation to her \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the only one of Picasso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lovers ever to walk out on him. I met her a few years ago in her apartment on the Upper West Side where she presented with the kind of fanatical chic only French women of a certain age can pull off. She wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interested in false modesty. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was considered astonishingly good,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said of herself as a young artist. And she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sentimental about the past. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have to admit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that I was never so much in love with anyone that I could not consider my own plan as interesting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I asked if leaving Picasso had been a liberating experience, she looked at me as if I was mad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No, because I was not a prisoner. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been there of my own will and I left of my own will. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I told him once, before I left. I said watch out, because I came when I wanted to, but I will leave when I want. He said, nobody leaves a man like me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She smiled and the thrill of that moment, 70 years later, disturbed the air in the room. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wednesday The school field trip to Staten Island is cancelled because of air quality in New York, a decision parents bemoan in the morning and revisit at lunchtime when the sky darkens to a Martian glow. The air is nicotine yellow; the sun is an eery orange disc; the cars have their headlights on at midday. While Californians fold their arms and say to New Yorkers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We told you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, people in the city re-mask and shut the windows. Outside my apartment, it smells as if there is a five-alarm fire a block away. The fires burning in Canada cover an area 10 times larger than is usual for this time of year and Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, describes the smoke across the state as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an emergency crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while New Yorkers describe it, variously, as smelling like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a barbecue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cigars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and \u00e2\u20ac\u01539/11\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It smells to me like cigarette smoke, carried 500 miles down wind by an area of low pressure and bringing a forecast to terrify us all. Thursday The spectacle of Harry in court this week makes one wince for the gap between what he might hope his appearance will achieve and how things in reality are likely to play out. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean in terms of judgment, exactly, but as John Crace wrote this week, the court system is an imprecise mechanism for the deliverance of closure and it is more likely to aggravate than soothe your unease. As ever with Harry, one understands that while the Mirror group is the main target of his ire, there is a family dynamic playing out, too. The 38-year-old prince must know how unbearable his father will find the breach of protocol inherent in his appearance in court, not to mention the implied criticism that while the king did nothing, Harry is the only one in the family with the mettle to take on the tabloids. And the corrupt you-asked-for-it logic of justifying the way he was hounded on the basis that he still seeks publicity seems likely to trail him until he retires to Gloucestershire and is never heard of again. Friday Drew Barrymore on the cover of New York magazine this week exhibits a style of celebrity that seems to date back to Lucille Ball. Barrymore, at 48, has a daytime chatshow in the US in which she giggles and sits on her legs and drops her jaw when someone says something mildly diverting, and empathises so busily with her guests that at times she looks in danger of exploding. (This style is described, by the magazine, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153radically intimate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and involves a lot of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153manifesting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153precepts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.) I urge you to look up her recent interview with the actor Melanie Lynskey, during the course of which Barrymore seizes on the alcoholism of Jason Ritter, Lynskey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s husband, with the avidity of a shark happening upon a seal. I would pay good money to see her apply that unruly energy to the field of Republican candidates for president."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/eu-agrees-radical-reforms-migration-asylum-laws", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "EU agrees radical reforms on migration and asylum laws ", "lead": "After years of infighting, 27-state bloc sets out new policies including charge of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20,000 a head for members that refuse to take refugees ", "author": "Lisa O'Carroll Brussels correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:07:56Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896644", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0b4ace855fa59671ac2b4b22154ea13c23a4315b/0_71_1080_648/500.jpg", "body": "The EU has agreed radical reforms of its migration and asylum laws including charges of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20,000 (\u00c2\u00a317,200) per head for member countries that refuse to host refugees. After almost 12 hours of intense negotiations in Luxembourg, and years of fighting, interior ministers struck a deal on Thursday on what they described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd new approach to what one politician described as an often \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toxic topic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Maria Malmer Stenergard, who was part of the Swedish lead negotiating team, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really believe I would be sitting here saying this \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but we have adopted general approaches on the asylum and migration management regulation and asylum procedure regulation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Under a last-minute compromise, it was agreed that member states, rather than the EU as a whole, would determine what country is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for migrants turned away on the grounds that they are not eligible for asylum. Countries will be obliged to show a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153connection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the country that any migrant is transferred to, but this link can be defined by the member state, diplomats said. This appears to give each country flexibility on whether they can return migrants to third countries that not every EU nation might agree is a safe haven. One source said the deal was struck after Italy and several other states demanded that the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153connection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rule \u00e2\u20ac\u201c requiring strong bonds with a third country, such as a years-long work history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was watered down. The legal text is not yet available but diplomats told reporters that it contains several examples of what a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153connection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to a third country for deportations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The recital says that the connection between the applicant and the safe, third country could be considered established in particular where a member or members of an applicant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family are present in that country, or where the applicant has settled or stayed in that country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one said. At the weakest interpretation of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153connection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rule, a member state that wants to return a migrant to a third country may need only to demonstrate that an applicant has stayed in the country, which would enable Italy, for example, to transfer migrants to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a transition country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such as Tunisia. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interior minister, Matteo Piantedosi, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today is a day where something is beginning. We are not arriving; we are setting off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The political significance of Italy, which is at the frontline of the migration crisis, is underlined by the revelation that European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen and Mark Rutte \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Dutch prime minister \u00e2\u20ac\u201c will join Italian PM Giorgia Meloni on a visit to Tunisia in the coming days. Meloni, who was swept to power last year on tough rhetoric about migrants, hopes to strike a partnership deal with the government to take migrants. A new system allowing for a redistribution of migrants across the EU will also be put in place, with an effective quota on how many people frontline states have to process before asking for help. Charges, which Poland branded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fines\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, for those countries who cannot take a share of relocated migrants were set at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20,000 per head, down from the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22,000 first mooted at the opening of Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s negotiations.

The current hospitality climate suggests that, by 2024, my closest \u00e2\u20ac\u0153restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the east London/Essex border could well be the Cinnabon concession at my local Asda, a profitable meeting of big brands selling 1,090 calorie-a-whirl, factory-made caramel PecanBons, so my hope is that, by the time the current madness eventually ends, at least some family-run, bespoke, flights of the imagination such as Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will have survived. Serving authentic Hyderbadi food that will puzzle anyone looking for a garish orange chicken tikka masala with half-rice, half-chips, Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is now in its second incarnation, this time in a suburb of Reading north of the town centre. If you take the train to Reading, you can walk to Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in 10-15 minutes, through the park and over Caversham bridge, which at the moment has a Hitchcockian number of ducks, geese and swans milling about, which is wonderful, although ornithophobics may prefer to take a cab. Either way, you cannot miss Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s: it was once a Wetherspoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, ergo it is enormous, and the front is now painted TeleTubbies Laa-Laa-yellow with Royal Mail-red lettering. Everything about Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This time, we are going big.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nandana Syamala and her husband, Sharat, first opened their doors on London Street in the heart of Reading back in 2018, and quickly made a name for themselves with their clay-pot biryanis, squid pakoras and bhuna venison. Then, in lockdown, they started sending out mail-order, vacuum-packed curries and sides, delivering first around Reading and then, hyper-ambitiously, nationwide. Many \u00e2\u20ac\u0153professional eaters\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd raved about them, lapping up Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kheema biryani, spiced fried chicken livers and beetroot potato tikki. Pivoting to home delivery during lockdown to save your restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skin was not, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll wager, the tremendous fun that many chefs tried to make it look on Instagram. Rather, it was a logistical headache. Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not only made it work, but they then made plans to move to a larger venue, which, due to building issues, was delayed and left them unable to trade through December 2022 and almost took them under. Nandana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blog about opening the new, improved Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is candid: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have put everything into this, including my health, wealth and soul. I am not the same person I was a few years ago. I have lost a bit of myself to Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 All I have is this obsession with creating something special.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well, Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is indeed special. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to sit down with a generous plate of its cabbage pakora with green coriander chutney or crab minapa garelu (savoury crab doughnuts), and not think that this is thoughtfully made and determinedly different from what many of us are used to with high-street Indian dining. Those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153donuts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are a rather gothic-looking dish of crab meat formed into small, chubby rings, dipped in peppery black gram flour, then deep-fried and submerged in a bowl of rather brown tomato and curry leaf rasam. Chepala pulusu, an Andhra-style fish curry cooked, the menu says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the way my mom makes it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, is also gloriously, defiantly brown, and features a large chunk of cod in a rich, punchily spiced tamarind sauce that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideal for scooping up with blush-coloured beetroot roti and methi roti all fragrant with fenugreek leaves. This is a vast, echoey room that needs some work on the acoustics, as well as possibly more staff on the floor, because the ones they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got seem to be working flat out already. But the food more than makes up for the occasional chaos: those chicken livers, or bhooni khaleji, for instance, were fried in heaps of cumin and coriander and had a lovely rush of dried mango powder. Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rightly renowned Hyderabadi-style dum biryani is fluffy and fragrant, can be made with mutton, paneer, shrimp, lamb or chicken, and comes with a cooling raita and, rather than the usual high-street, soupy sauce, a balm-like, toffee-coloured, creamy salan. In fact, Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made me go home, get out some books and try to work out exactly what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d eaten, such as the mahekhalya sauce with the beef osso bucco that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made from onions and crushed coconut, or the Portuguese-influenced shrimp moilee with coconut milk and curry leaves. Having gone big on the vankaya fry of long aubergines in peanut and sesame seed and the tomato pappu \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a dal with tomato and black mustard seeds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was no room left for dessert, so I have no idea what the anokhi kheer, or Hyderabadi onion pudding garnished with pistachio, even looks like. But Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has one of those menus that I feel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep going back to. Food doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get much more personal than this and there is a pure Field of Dreams vibe to the fact that it even exists: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you build it, they will come,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shoeless Joe said in that film. In Clay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case, I think they will.

David Grusch, a former intelligence official who led analysis of unexplained anomalous phenomena (UAP) within a US Department of Defense agency, caused headlines around the world with his assertion that the US had been collecting non-human craft for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decades\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That prompted the US House of Representatives to announce an investigation into Grusch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations, with a hearing on the issue expected to be announced in the next few weeks. The hearing is set to be the latest official US response in recent years to the issue of UAPs, which has raised heated speculation among UFO believers as well as prompted national security concerns in America about the possibility of unknown craft from other states that could be penetrating US air space or operating around the globe. But Grusch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whistleblowing claims have grown more dramatic after he has emerged into the public eye and are now facing growing skepticism. After initially telling the Debrief website the government had possession of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intact and partially intact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd alien vehicles, he has gone on to suggest the US has also encountered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153malevolent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd alien pilots. Experts in UFO lore have suggested his assertions should be taken with a grain of salt, questioned the veracity of his claims and demanded proof. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He has not presented anything like the evidence that we would expect to believe something as extraordinary as this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Garrett Graff, a journalist and historian whose upcoming book UFO: The Inside Story of the US Government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Search for Alien Life Here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Out There will be published in October. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no firsthand knowledge. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see these things himself. He didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t touch them. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of the operation to retrieve them and we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard from anyone who was.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Debrief published the allegations from Grusch, who left the government in April after a 14-year career in US intelligence, on Monday. He told the news outlet that secretive US government agencies and defense contractors had been recovering fragments of non-human craft, and in some cases entire craft, for decades. According to the Debrief, Grusch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knowledge of non-human materials and vehicles was based on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extensive interviews with high-level intelligence officials\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said he had reported the existence of a UFO material \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recovery program\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Congress and filed a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general. That complaint contained classified locations, program names and other data, the Debrief said. But in a follow-up interview with NewsNation on Tuesday night, Grusch said the US had also found alien pilots. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, naturally, when you recover something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s either landed or crashed, sometimes you encounter dead pilots and believe it or not, as fantastical as that sounds, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Grusch said. Grusch said there was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sophisticated disinformation program targeting the US populace\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to suppress information on UFOs, which is a common conspiracy trope in the UFO community. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The story aligns with a lot of similar stories that have played out, going back to the 1980s and 1970s, that together allege that the US government has kept an incredible secret, the literal most extraordinary secret that mankind could have, for not just weeks or months, but years and decades, with no meaningful leak or documentary evidence to ever come forward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Graff said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I think when you look at the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to keep secret other really important secrets, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of reason to doubt the capability of the government to do that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As the week has gone on, Grusch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims have expanded even further. He said some of the craft were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153football field size\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and told le Parisien, a French newspaper, that the US had possession of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bell-like craft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which Benito Mussolini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government had recovered in northern Italy in 1933. Former colleagues have vouched for Grusch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character and another official backed up Grusch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account to the Debrief. But the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office, which was established to investigate UAP by the Department of Defense \u00e2\u20ac\u201c replacing the UAP taskforce which Grusch claims was not allowed access to some materials \u00e2\u20ac\u201c issued an unequivocal denial. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To date, AARO has not discovered any verifiable information to substantiate claims that any programs regarding the possession or reverse-engineering of extraterrestrial materials have existed in the past or exist currently. AARO is committed to following the data and its investigation wherever it leads,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sue Gough, a spokesperson for the Department of the Defense. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AARO, working with the office of the general counsel and the air force office of special investigations, has established a safe and secure process for individuals to come forward with information to aid AARO in its congressionally-mandated historical review. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AARO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historical review of records and testimonies is ongoing and due to Congress by June 2024. AARO welcomes the opportunity to speak with any former or current government employee or contractor who believes they have information relevant to the historical review.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mick West, a science journalist and author who is a noted UFO skeptic, told NewsNation that parts of Grusch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153essentially part of UFO mythology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Like Graff, he said the fact that Grusch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evidence is secondhand makes it difficult to believe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge point. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not someone who worked on any of these programs. He said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any photographs, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not actually seen these things: he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talked to people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd West said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And we know there are people who think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked on programs, there have been people coming forward many years. It never actually amounts to anything, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite possible that people have become convinced that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working on programs like this simply because reverse engineering programs of crashed things are actually real.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Re-engineering efforts go all the way back to the first world war, when the US began retrieving German equipment from the battlefield and rebuilding it. In his interview, West pointed to the example of Kosmos 954, a Soviet Union satellite that exploded over Canada. A Canadian-American team collected debris and, West said, attempted to reassemble it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That would have been top secret, that would have been a highly compartmentalized program and you could very easily see how people working on a program like this could come to believe that they are actually working on UFOs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if he believes Grusch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story West said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saying is accurate. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite possible he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s believing in what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s saying, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite an incredible story that really needs some actual verification \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be coming soon.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/09/key-inter-players-champions-league-final-acerbi-martinez-manchester-city", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "From Acerbi to Mart\u00c3\u00adnez: five key Inter players in Champions League final ", "lead": "Our selection also includes the midfielder hoping to become the tournament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first Turkish winner and a boyhood Inter fan", "author": "Nicky Bandini", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:00:52Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896656", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a2eb09db3d74e4ac9d7dd5565610965332831392/9_0_4983_2991/500.jpg", "body": "Lautaro Mart\u00c3\u00adnez Whether Edin Dzeko or Romelu Lukaku lines up alongside him, Mart\u00c3\u00adnez is the sure thing in Internazionale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack. He won the World Cup in December, even if not everyone was keen to give him much credit after a tournament in which he failed to register a goal or assist. It later emerged that he had been playing on an injured ankle that required pain-killing injections throughout. In any case, he has been prolific for Inter, scoring 28 times \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two shy of Diego Milito\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tally during their 2010 treble-winning campaign. Mart\u00c3\u00adnez is all too aware that his compatriot completed his haul with a pair in the Champions League final. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hear about these things,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes you believe [history can repeat], sometimes no. The important thing is to be ourselves and attack City with courage. They ought to be worried about us, too.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hakan Calhanoglu No Turkish player has won the Champions League but Calhanoglu, captain of the national team, hopes to become the first in Istanbul. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the most beautiful city in the world for me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in an interview for Uefa last week, adding that he hoped the final could bring some joy to his country after the earthquake that cost tens of thousands of lives this year. Adapted by Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manager, Simone Inzaghi, from a No 10 into a deep-lying playmaker, his position changed again when Henrikh Mkhitaryan was injured in the second leg of their semi-final win over Milan, moving into a box-to-box role on the left of the midfield three so that Marcelo Brozovic could slot into the middle. Regardless of where he lines up, Calhanoglu will back himself, recently saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I see myself as one of the top five in Europe at what I do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nicol\u00c3\u00b2 Barella Samir Handanovic remains Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s captain, and others have worn the armband since the goalkeeper lost his starting role, yet it is Barella who often sets a tone. That can be a double-edged sword. He is a tireless runner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only Milan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sandro Tonali has covered more distance in this season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Champions League \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and selfless contributor at both ends of the pitch but has sometimes struggled to contain his frustration when teammates fail to match his high standards. He has delivered in key moments on this run to the final, scoring the opening goal in both legs against Benfica as well as his team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first in the 3-3 group stage draw with Barcelona. As Barella tells it, though, the journey here began with defeat by Sevilla in the 2020 Europa League final. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From that pain we started winning trophies, a league, the cups,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are lifting Inter back up where it deserves to be.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Francesco Acerbi Alessandro Bastoni spoke for Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defenders on Monday, insisting that fear was something you could feel toward \u00e2\u20ac\u0153assassins\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but not centre-forwards, even ones as brilliant as Erling Haaland. A modern, ball-playing centre-back who has collected three assists on the way to this final, the 24-year-old found himself fending off a reporter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestions that he might be a classic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Guardiola player\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Acerbi, 11 years his senior, is something different: an unshowy and sometimes awkward-looking defender whose signing by Inter last summer was not well received by supporters but who has won them over by marking several talented No 9s out of games \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including Olivier Giroud in both legs of the semi-final \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as with his brutally blunt demeanour. Before the return game against Milan, he told journalists that losing now would make it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shit season\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Asked this week what a perfect game against Haaland and co might look like, he replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not interested in perfect. All I care about is lifting the cup.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Federico Dimarco One of the defining acts of Inzaghi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management at Inter has been the rehabilitation of Dimarco, a boyhood fan of the Nerazzurri who had spent half a decade playing for different clubs on loans and short-term deals. Over the past two years he has established himself as one of the most effective wing-backs in Italy, a diligent worker and excellent crosser whose five Champions League assists this season trail only Kevin De Bruyne and Vin\u00c3\u00adcius J\u00c3\u00banior. He credits his growth to the experience gained playing big matches for club and country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The games against Barcelona [in the group stage] changed me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said this week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those matches helped turn me into a different player completely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/09/the-best-recent-science-fiction-fantasy-and-horror-reviews-roundup", "primaryCategory": "books", "title": "The best recent science fiction, fantasy and horror \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reviews roundup", "lead": "Perilous Times by Thomas D Lee; The Grief Nurse by Angie Spoto; Airside by Christopher Priest; Hokey Pokey by Kate Mascarenhas; The Shadow Cabinet by Juno Dawson", "author": "Lisa Tuttle", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:00:52Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896659", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dbdedcb5821132038e59c9d7ddfeaf1b48a5c73d/60_237_5862_3518/500.jpg", "body": "Perilous Times by Thomas D Lee (Orbit, \u00c2\u00a316.99) Merlin ensured that King Arthur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knights would return from a magical sleep whenever the kingdom was in peril.

This audacious, original debut is angry as well as entertaining, and an exciting new take on the Matter of Britain. The Grief Nurse by Angie Spoto (Sandstone, \u00c2\u00a316.99) Lynx is the titular Grief Nurse, marked from birth by the pale eyes and white hair that indicate her special power to absorb and relieve the sorrow, fear, anxiety and heartaches of her employers. She is kept by the wealthy Aster family to banish every negative feeling, so they always glow with health and happiness, even at the funeral of their eldest son. Lynx has never questioned her role, until the arrival of another Grief Nurse on the Asters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 private island opens her eyes to her own unhappiness. The island comes to seem more like a trap when bad weather makes it impossible to leave, and people start dying. A powerful debut novel that explores serious, sensitive issues through a unique prism of fantasy. Airside by Christopher Priest (Gollancz, \u00c2\u00a322) In 1949, a Hollywood film star flew from New York to London and vanished. In the 1960s, Justin Farmer, a film student in London, is charmed by her movies and intrigued by the unsolved mystery of her disappearance, though it is not until years later, when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a respected film historian and critic, that he meets people who may know what happened to her. He also has his own uncanny experience in the liminal space of an international airport. The spirit of La Jet\u00c3\u00a9e, Chris Marker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1962 short SF film, hovers over the latest novel from the author of The Prestige. Reviews of real movies complement interviews with fictional characters and musings on people who choose to disappear; the mixture of stress and boredom that permeates modern air travel is interwoven with Farmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation to create an absorbing, distinctive narrative. Hokey Pokey by Kate Mascarenhas (Head of Zeus, \u00c2\u00a316.99) The new novel from the author of The Psychology of Time Travel is set in 1929, mainly in and around a hotel in central Birmingham where Nora, a half English, half Czech doctor with the uncanny ability to precisely mimic the speech of anyone she hears, has arrived to spy on another guest. What begins as a compelling psychological mystery in a vividly real setting turns to the supernatural, when Nora wakes one night to find a huge dog on her bed. A local woman confirms she has seen the ghost of an axe murderer who used to work nearby, and Nora knew him. The story plunges into full-on visceral horror as we learn about Nora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s childhood connection to a terrible murder that affected the course of her life. A well-plotted, original, nightmare blend of madness and monsters. The Shadow Cabinet by Juno Dawson (HarperVoyager, \u00c2\u00a316.99) The sequel to Her Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Secret Coven takes up the story of modern witches following the cliffhanger ending of the first. We finally get the inside scoop on Niamh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evil twin\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Ciara, and some shocking revelations relating to a couple of previously minor characters. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great read, every bit as exciting, intelligent and addictive as the first, with a third (final?) volume still to come."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/09/faith-hope-and-carnage-by-nick-cave-and-sean-ohagan-review-heartfelt-conversations", "primaryCategory": "books", "title": "Faith, Hope and Carnage by Nick Cave and Se\u00c3\u00a1n O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hagan review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c heartfelt conversations", "lead": "The Australian singer-songwriter is candid and charismatic in these in-depth discussions about art, music, life and loss", "author": "Fiona Sturges", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:00:52Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896661", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b5b535a42898b66c83399e6c7fbe7bda1ccea7b9/0_215_2667_1600/500.jpg", "body": "Faith, Hope and Carnage is built around a series of telephone exchanges in lockdown in 2020 between the musician Nick Cave and the journalist Se\u00c3\u00a1n O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hagan. These conversations were later transcribed and arranged as an extended Q&amp;A, and a memoir of sorts, in which Cave reflects on art, music, religion, death, his childhood in Australia and his hell-raising early adulthood. The audiobook, then, is the project come full circle, with Cave and O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hagan narrating the text of their conversations. If O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hagan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s delivery is a little flat at times, it is not a problem that afflicts Cave, who is heartfelt, charismatic and sage-like, even when tackling the most difficult of topics.

In the months following the accident, he was sent into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a chaos that was also kind of an incapacitation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though he has since channelled his grief into a new and more empathetic way of being. In 2018, Cave launched The Red Hand Files, a website where he invites people to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ask me anything\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concept the once publicity-averse singer would previously have found unthinkable, though now he sees human connection and candour as crucial to his ability to carry on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Collective grief can bring extraordinary change, a kind of conversion of the spirit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says, in a broader reflection on humanity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can seize this opportunity or we can squander it and let it pass us by.

But here in America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest metropolis, you still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t legally buy a bottle of wine from a grocery store. The restriction dates back to the end of prohibition, and while most other US states have done away with similar laws, it has remained on the books in New York for close to a century, baffling visitors and frustrating residents. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My first assumption is that someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profiting from [the rule] somehow,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Andrew Laska, a Brooklyn-based engineer shopping at the Wegmans supermarket on his lunch break. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just old structures in place that are preventing change.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His suspicions are correct: the biggest opponents of reform are New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roughly 3,700 liquor stores, which have beaten back multiple attempts to allow wine to be sold in grocery stores, including a prominent push by the former governor David Paterson in 2009. The latest try, a New York state bill with the public support of the Wegmans company, appears doomed with just days remaining in this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legislative session. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get it done this year. In fact, I know we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it done this year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sponsor, the state senator Liz Krueger, told the New York Post last week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping that New Yorkers will take a look at our whole approach to how and where we sell different kinds of alcohol and say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really make sense any more.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paul Zuber, the executive vice-president of the Business Council, a New York industry group that represents Wegmans, blames \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extremely organized, self-entrenched interests\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for defending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this archaic, anti-business, anti-expansion statute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not what the people want\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A recent poll commissioned by Wegmans showed New Yorkers strongly in favor of allowing wine sales in grocery stores, including 70% of voters in New York City and 79% of voters upstate. Wegmans reportedly donated more than $30,000 to the campaign, and it has even put up signs in its stores promoting the bill that read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for wine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The grocery chain did not return a request for comment. But New York City liquor stores say they are defending an endangered, more intimate tradition of commerce that makes the city special. Allowing wine to be sold in supermarkets would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153another example of small businesses getting mauled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Michael Correra, the owner of a liquor store, Michael-Towne Wine and Spirits, and the executive director of the Metropolitan Package Store Association, which represents liquor stores across the city. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How many bakers and butchers are left? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no artisans any more. This is one of the few local businesses left,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. If Krueger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bill passed, it would upend rules that have been in place since 1934, when New York began regulating the sale of alcohol after prohibition. At the time, officials decided that liquor stores would be the only businesses able to sell spirits and wine, and each business owner could only have a single license. The idea was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to make it easy for people to obtain liquor and wine and at the same time be temperate \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We can amend the rules, make changes if necessary later,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Edward P Mulrooney, then the chairman of New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alcohol and beverage control board, told the New York Times. Officials back then envisioned liquor stores as local gatekeepers of the feared substance. Limiting sales to mom-and-pop stores meant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the owner is in the store all the time, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be part of the community, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to know when somebody has a drinking problem\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Zuber says. Edward P Mulrooney might not have guessed that his rules would remain largely in place 89 years later. Today, along with the single-license rule and the ban on wine sales in grocery stores, New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquor stores still may not open before noon on Sunday. And until last year, liquor stores were forbidden to operate on Christmas Day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The argument from the liquor stores is: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWell, my family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had this business since the 1930s. They started this business under a certain set of laws, and we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change those laws,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zuber says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the world has changed. If I got my driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s license in the 1960s, and a cop pulls me over and says, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your seatbelt?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWell, those laws weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there when I got my license.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Correra says criticisms like these miss the point. His store has been operating out of the posh Brooklyn Heights neighborhood since 1934, which has allowed it to cultivate close bonds with customers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while keeping a watchful eye on them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do a hell of a good job of keeping it out of the hands of the wrong people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen pictures in other states where wine and liquor is sold in grocery stores, in floor displays next to Doritos. Or hard vodka next to Sunny D. People don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see controlled products sold by 14-year-old kids. It just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen in our state, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m proud to be a part of it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Wine makes up over 70% of Michael-Towne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sales. If the Gristedes grocery store across the street were allowed to start selling wine, the effect on his business would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catastrophic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Correra. Same goes for other liquor store owners, many of them immigrants: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They work so hard, and they care, and this is gonna get demolished.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd New York\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liquor stores offer another selling point: interesting wines. At Myrtle Wines &amp; Spirits, just a few blocks from the Brooklyn Wegmans, the wines are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost all artisanal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says the owner, Colin Clarke, who also operates a wine bar with festive decor next door. Small wine and spirit producers around the world \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the marketing budget\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to negotiate with big retailers, so small shops like Myrtle \u00e2\u20ac\u0153step in and connect them to the customer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, says Clarke. If Wegmans were to stock its shelves with wine, it would probably be full of mass market products, Clarke says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d find the biggest distributors in the city feeding products to those places.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clarke sees his store as something that enlivens the surrounding area: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a transactional business. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re creating something that connects to the neighborhood, that people feel proud of.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The question is what matters more to New Yorkers: community or convenience? Laska, the Brooklyn engineer, says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d happily buy wine at Wegmans if the supermarket carried enough of a selection. But not, he adds, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if it was just Yellow Tail. I would want more than just the bottom of the barrel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/09/binance-coinbase-us-government-cryptocurrency", "primaryCategory": "technology", "title": "US targets Binance and Coinbase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the government ready to regulate crypto?", "lead": "Regulators have been confused about whether cryptocurrency is a security or a commodity, but clarity appears imminent", "author": "Edward Helmore in New York", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:00:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896669", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7b78c6eb630b926d2a221e875e15b8410d94d30c/31_0_3926_2357/500.jpg", "body": "For years, US financial regulators couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on what to do about cryptocurrency. They wanted to do something, but couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on what crypto was \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a security, like a stock or bond, or a commodity, like a raw material or agricultural product, or neither? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and which agency would have jurisdiction. This week, Gary Gensler, a longtime critic of crypto and the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), appears to have found the answer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by launching a crackdown on crypto exchanges, the platforms on which investors buy and sell digital currencies. The effort to establish clarity came in the form of back-to-back lawsuits. The first accused industry giant Binance of a range of securities violations, including mishandling customer funds and misleading investors and regulators. The second claimed that the biggest US crypto platform Coinbase of running an illegal exchange. A 101-page lawsuit filed in federal court in New York on Tuesday alleges Coinbase skirted SEC rules for years by letting users trade crypto tokens that were actually unregistered securities. Gensler has repeatedly argued that most tokens fall under SEC oversight, and has warned government-regulated banks to steer clear. By declaring Coinbase an illegal exchange, the SEC chief makes it harder for US crypto traders to trade digital tokens. In an interview with Bloomberg, Gensler depicted the crackdown as an effort to protect investors and the integrity of US securities markets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why should the New York stock exchange or broker-dealers we all know and respect be undermined by this other corner of the capital markets, which is sort of saying, thumbing their nose and saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCatch us if you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The lawsuit against Binance, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest token exchange, takes a different approach. The 136-page complaint accuses the company of avoiding rules by letting Americans improperly open accounts and trade. In a statement, Gensler said Binance and its chief executive, Changpeng Zhao, had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153engaged in an extensive web of deception, conflicts of interest, lack of disclosure, and calculated evasion of the law\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Binance issued a statement saying that it will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vigorously defend itself\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the case against the SEC. The SEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moves against Coinbase and Binance do not address whether cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities, a debate that has caused confusion for regulators and meant that for years regulation of the digital token business has fallen between the two stools of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Federal agencies always seek to expand their scope of jurisdiction, so obviously the SEC would like to call these things securities, and going after the exchanges is one way to stake out their claim,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Charles Elson, chair in corporate governance at the University of Delaware. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to call it a security to do that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the SEC is involved in a lawsuit that may decide whether it has jurisdiction over crypto. In 2020, the SEC sued the tech payment and exchange company Ripple, contending that its XRP token is a security. The regulator alleges Ripple illegally raised almost $1.4bn by selling XRP in violation of investor-protection rules. The company is aggressively fighting the suit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it expects to have spent $200m on its defense. Chief executive Brad Garlinghouse has argued that Gensler himself has issued contradictory statements about digital assets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You have video footage of the chair of the SEC, as a professor at MIT, saying 75% of these digital assets are commodities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told CNBC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And now he says they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all securities because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the head of the SEC and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seeking power and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s putting power ahead of sound policy to grow an economy in the United States.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A ruling is expected this year. In its complaint, the SEC contends that a dozen or more tokens offered on Coinbase are also securities. But the Coinbase lawyer Paul Grewal pointed out that the SEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an enforcement-only approach\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c came without clear guidance on virtual currencies and as such \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is hurting America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic competitiveness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Coinbase\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Brian Armstrong, told a Bloomberg conference on Wednesday the platform would carry on as normal. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As these court cases play out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really business as usual.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The SEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main role is to look for financial fraud in investing, and that mandate covers securities. When the SEC was established in 1932, it was clear what was a stock and what was a bond, says Elson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today, that definition has broadened quite a bit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The agency that is charged with protecting the investing public views these cryptocurrencies as monetary investments, and this expands their jurisdiction to cover what they think is problematic. Anytime they see an investment they think looks and smells like a security they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be interested.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The collapse of crypto exchange FTX last year put crypto in Washington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headlights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least because FTX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was a major political donor. Since its collapse, US regulators have increased their scrutiny of the sector. Some analysts believe this latest spate of legal moves will lead to a clearer set of rules for crypto. In a note to investors this week, analysts at TD Cowen wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This litigation may not be a positive for Coinbase, but it should be a positive for the crypto space. It should get crypto closer to final rules of the road regardless of how the judge rules.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But in a clear message on Tuesday, Gensler underlined his antipathy to the sector and made it clear that he did not believe digital currencies are a necessary form of currency. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need more digital currency,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told CNBC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We already have digital currency: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called the US dollar. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called the euro or it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called the yen; they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all digital right now. We already have digital investments.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd According to Elson, however, the SEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural instinct to expand its reach to crypto exchanges resolves the question of which regulator would take on the challenge of crypto. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One way or the other there was going to be regulation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of those things where technology has leapfrogged regulatory authority. The whole thing is ephemeral. Crypto is cloud-like in its origins and cloud-like in how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carried out. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very strange form of investing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hope this will make it safer for the public to invest in crypto.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/09/motorsport-iron-dames-le-mans-with-history-and-podium-in-their-sights", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt is the pinnacle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Iron Dames take on Le Mans with history in their sights | Giles Richards", "lead": "At 100th anniversary of legendary race, a team created to promote women in motorsport have their eyes on a podium place", "author": "Giles Richards", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T11:00:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896671", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3847e24ef51f7224a7bd35a5c9b547523ee5ca6c/344_245_3794_2277/500.jpg", "body": "One hundred years on and the challenge of the Le Mans 24 Hours remains as captivating as it was when the clock began its first countdown in 1923. As the greatest sports-car race in the world celebrates its centenary this weekend, one of its little-known but most trailblazing innovations, not of technology or engineering, is pertinent now perhaps more than ever. Swiss driver Rahel Frey knows change is coming in motor racing and while it has been torturously slow she is enthusiastic to be at the vanguard of promoting it at the vingt-quatre with the all-female Iron Dames team. She is proud of anything that can be done to encourage greater female participation in the sport, even if it is something of a cliche. Sometimes making a point, is the point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have decided to race in pink suits and with the pink car,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to underline our message that we support females in our sport and I am proud to have such a bright car so the Iron Dames can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be missed. I hope people who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t followed the race before will choose our pink Porsche and follow it throughout the race.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Frey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enthusiasm, shared by fellow drivers Sarah Bovy and Michelle Gatting, from Belgium and Denmark respectively, is palpable. Le Mans has always driven advances in racing and road car technology but for women in the sport, 100 years has been an awfully long time with awfully little representation. The first 24 Heures du Mans was held in 1923 and the organisers, the Automobile Club de l\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Ouest (ACO), who put on this annual spectacle at the Circuit de la Sarthe in France, were more forward thinking than most. From the off they mandated that women were entitled to compete on an equal footing alongside men, which for the time was remarkable. The first women to race at Le Mans were Marguerite Mareuse and Odette Siko in 1930, who came seventh in their Bugatti Type 40. Siko, a pioneering French driver, would win her class at La Sarthe in 1932; her fourth place overall remains the highest finish for a female driver at the race. As the decades ticked by Le Mans only grew in popularity, a test, largely, of man and machine that put both through their paces with relentless demands and no little drama, such that during the Group C era of the 1980s, sports-car racing was a serious rival to Formula One. Women had kept up a small but noticeable participation in the 24, including Mich\u00c3\u00a8le Mouton who won her class in 1975 before moving on to become a hugely successful rally driver with Audi. But the numbers regarding female participation in motorsport remained tiny, 65 in total since 1923. In part this was due to the ACO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial decision to row back on its originally progressive attitude by banning women from taking part between 1957 and 1971. The drive to change these numbers is one of the purposes behind the Iron Dames project. The all-female squad, which will compete in the No 85 Porsche 911 RSR-19 in the GTE-AM class, is part of the team created with the intention of promoting women in motorsport at every level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c driving, engineering, management \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and which has been successfully doing so since 2018. They have entered an all-female team in the 24 since 2019, securing ninth place three times as well as seventh last year in their class. This time they want a podium. The team was formed in 2017 and first raced in 2018 at the Dubai 24 Hours, a year before the W Series struck out in a similar direction. Since then they have become the first all-female team to take a podium in the World Endurance Championship, in 2022. They also won their class at the 24 Hours of Spa in the same year. One of the founders of the project is Deborah Mayer, now president of the FIA Women in Motorsport Commission. She believes competing at Le Mans is key to making a difference. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The project is dear to my heart, it is a programme which is there for the long term,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Le Mans is the most mythical race and it is important to be there, because Le Mans is the lighthouse of endurance racing. It is one of the most complete races that exists. As a team it is pivotal to be there, to show our potential and the will to excel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As a showcase for the team, Le Mans in 2023 could not be better. The race is drawing more attention than ever with the new hypercar class attracting manufacturers in droves. This year Ferrari also return to the scene of some of their greatest triumphs for the first time since they last raced in the top class in 1973. Indeed, the Scuderia claimed pole position and a front-row lockout on Thursday night, their first for half a century when Arturo Merzario and Carlos Pace were on top back in seventy-three. They are joined by Porsche, reigning champions Toyota, Cadillac and Peugeot. The meeting has sold out to its capacity of 300,000 for the first time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you drive it, Le Mans is simply spectacular,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Frey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have never experienced a race as intense as the first time here. I believe that is the same for every driver and that is what makes you want to come back and that is the same for spectators. Once you have been once, you want to come back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She is spot on. It is an addiction, a spectacle like no other. The 37-year-old has adored the sport since her father let her take a shot at karting, since when she has successfully pursued a career as a full-time driver. For Frey, Le Mans remains a unique experience. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the Porsche curves, two long left-handers and then a quick right-hander, you simply feel the power and the downforce of the car,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says with a smile. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the same sensation of speed anywhere else. You really feel the force of the car, you feel very much linked with your car. It gives you a sensation of speed, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a unique track.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When darkness falls and the headlights pierce the gloom amid the pervading smell of barbecues from the boisterously entertaining campsites, the track, the atmosphere and the challenge is like no other. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From a driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective at the first part of the night, you are excited in the dark,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Frey. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You follow your intuition \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sliding into corners, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see braking points properly so sometimes you overshoot but you manage to stay on track. Most challenging is the second part of the night, two or three in the morning. The night is not done and the last hours before the sun comes up again is just intense, it feels long and that is the most important part where you cannot make mistakes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just finishing the 24 is rightly considered an achievement, a team effort from everyone involved with an enormous sense of release when the flag falls on Sunday. There is also a huge sense of pride. This is a feeling multiplied at the Iron Dames. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In 2018 we were five women, now we are 28 women,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Mayer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not only drivers, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about all the women in motorsport at all levels working as a team. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At Le Mans there is no place for egos, you need all of these people working together. It is the pinnacle of racing and it shows all the possibilities in racing, where there are 300,000 passionate people, pushing you to succeed. It is absolutely beyond words.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/09/digi-luke-is-mark-hamill-really-retiring-from-star-wars", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "Just as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve fallen in love with digi-Luke, is Mark Hamill really retiring from Star Wars?", "lead": "Now we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen de-aged, youngish, CGI-assisted Luke, surely this is the opportunity for the moisture farmer turned Jedi Master to return to the centre of the galaxy far, far away", "author": "Ben Child", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T10:54:31Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896676", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a551cbb2dfa3e4bc84d2a892eb499170ed0bf6ba/0_113_3172_1902/500.jpg", "body": "A fond farewell, then, to all that. The swishy lightsabers; the bullseyeing of womp rats and conveniently located Death Star kill buttons; the parental epiphany-fuelled screams of anguish.

But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Hamill during an interview with CBS Sunday Morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, you never say never. I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any reason to,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let me put it that way: I mean, they have so many stories to tell, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need Luke any more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that you say? Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Hamill retire at least twice before, or at least show no significant indication that he would return to the role of everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite Tatooinian moisture farmer turned saviour of the known galaxy for at least a decade or so? Well, yes, there was a considerable period (between 1983 and 2015, to be precise) when Hamill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Skywalker was very much out of the picture. He then returned, only to be killed off again in the critically acclaimed (though minority-trolled) The Last Jedi, as a middle-aged Luke, before unexpectedly turning up in cameos as a de-aged version of the Jedi Knight in the TV shows The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett, to fan rapture. There have even been recent reports that Hamill might be back as a Force ghost in the recently announced Daisy Ridley-led Star Wars film, alongside Hayden Christensen as his dear old dead dad, Anakin. And Hamill is a mischievous sort, so could easily be pulling our legs here. Even so, it seems a pity we won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be getting to see Luke again, just as the technology seems to exist for further adventures alongside our favourite Jedi Master. They say be careful what you wish for, and who knows if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll one day regret wishing for more CGI-assisted Luke adventures set in the era of The Mandalorian \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just as AI experts will probably wonder why they kept programming computers to be more intelligent, right up to the moment when a brand-new superintelligence covers the entire planet with organic life-killing nanobots. And yet, as a Star Wars fan, I do. Especially so as the realisation of de-aged Luke in that episode with baby Yoda was so wonderful that it is hard to imagine Disney/Lucasfilm not taking the whole concept further. An entire series, or new movie, starring Hamill as youngish Luke seems like a very logical next step from both a commercial and creative point of view for Star Wars. Or at the very least, digi-Luke could turn up as one of the key players in Dave Filoni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed new film about the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153escalating war between the Imperial remnant and the New Republic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That movie is being pitched as an Avengers-style cinematic event that will bring together Din Djarin, Ahsoka Tano, Boba Fett and other heroes from recent TV spin-offs set in the period between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, so the appearance of Skywalker would appear to make total sense. It would also give Lucasfilm the opportunity to continue fleshing out the fiercely divisive radical personality shift that took place in Luke between his appearance as a confident young Jedi Master in the 1983 film and his turn as an anxiety-racked elder in The Last Jedi. Instead we are getting the return of Daisy Ridley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rey, a character who passed through the sequel trilogy with all the gravitas of a Kowakian monkey-lizard who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just realised Jabba the Hutt fancies eating him for dinner. I feel like teenage Luke himself after being told he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run off to join the Academy because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed to farm moisture or pick up some power converters.

The mural of the menacing witch reaching her spindly fingers towards passersby covers the gable end wall of the Larachmhor Tavern, a 19th-century category C listed building that sits within the conservation area of Pittenweem, Fife. The unanimous decision by Fife council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s north-east planning committee to order the removal of the painting was made last week after a retrospective application by the owner of the tavern, who commissioned the mural for Halloween last year. The committee ruled that the work by Rogue One \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also know as Bobby McNamara, and who is a fixture of Glasgow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well-established street art scene \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was not in keeping with the muted tones around Pittenweem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic harbourside. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Garish\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a descriptive that the artist himself was quite happy to employ, along with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bold\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ugly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as he explained how his work was inspired by the classic Disney witches of the Wizard of Oz and Snow White. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a quaint wee village and this is a strong mural,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but I did my own research into the women who were killed there, and I wanted to get people talking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some of those who complained to him while he was working on the mural \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there were plenty of others who welcomed it, he added \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said they \u00e2\u20ac\u0153didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be reminded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of past persecutions. But the row comes as the drive for posthumous justice for the thousands of people persecuted as witches in post-Reformation Scotland is growing, with campaigners pushing for an official pardon after the former first minister Nicola Sturgeon issued a formal apology last International Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day to those tortured and often executed under the Witchcraft Act 1563. Sean Dillon, a Lib Dem councillor who grew up in the village, said that Pittenween had never shied away from its dark past, but added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The residents who have contacted me have said that the portrayal of an 18th-century villager as a stereotypical witch that one might find on Halloween is rather insensitive, especially given the present-day links within the village to the accused women. Despite these events happening over three centuries ago, there are still families within Pittenweem who can trace their family trees back to the supposed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwitches\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The charity Remembering the Accused Witches of Scotland (RAWS) estimates that during the great witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries there were approximately 350 known accused witches in Fife, with up to 28 accused in Pittenweem itself, most famously Janet Cornfoot, who escaped from the local tollbooth but was caught and returned to Pittenweem, where she was lynched by a mob. The chair of RAWS, Sheila Gaul, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Murals have been a great way to remember the accused locally, with some beautiful examples in nearby Valleyfield. But this image is unfortunately a stereotype and not a true representation of those accused of witchcraft or the horrors they went through\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. RAWS has plans to educate a new generation of schoolchildren about this historical campaign of femicide and create a national monument to those ordinary people whose lives were ripped apart. The charity believed in memorialisation, said Gaul, and the telling of the stories of the accused, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but it should be respectful and dignified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Others have defended the mural, with Leonard Low, a local historian, dismissing critics as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153snowflakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Low told the Dundee-based Courier newspaper that he believed the mural should be embraced as a means of promoting the village\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the mural is fantastic and I absolutely endorse it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about time somebody was milking the place for the tourism it deserves.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An online petition organised by another local calls for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beautiful and individual painting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be saved, arguing that it is likely to engage visitors in the same way the village\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summer arts festival does, with benefits for local businesses still struggling after the pandemic. The owner of the Larachmhor Tavern, who has declined to comment throughout the row, now has three months to appeal against the decision. But McNamara was philosophical: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a street artist, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to murals coming and going.

As cacophony subsides, the voice sinks into the wall itself, observing successive generations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their sex, death and ornaments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like a climate-change Beckett, gradually falling to rubble. All of It \u00e2\u20ac\u201c first seen in 2020 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is genius. A journey from birth to void, McDowall brilliantly captures how febrile consciousness scribbles around our spoken half-truths (mostly, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd).

Today marks the release of the fourth album by French singer Christine and the Queens, AKA H\u00c3\u00a9lo\u00c3\u00afse Letissier. Back in 2014, Letissier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut LP, Chaleur Humaine (human warmth) marked the arrival of a playful alt-pop artist marked by their experimentalism both in terms of gender politics and an insouciant attitude towards French and English, floating effortlessly between the two and writing slick parallel versions of tracks which were more like siblings than twins. On his second album, released in 2018, came a more decidedly danceable sound, possibly the best ever use of a GarageBand preset, and a new persona, for whom the record was named: Chris. Letissier is an artist who can both collaborate with Charli XCX on a pop banger and write excoriating songs about the futility of life itself. (I listened to Doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Matter so many times during a particularly difficult period, along with the episode of Song Exploder where Letissier breaks apart every element of the song in minute detail, that I feel like the song is permanently lodged in my brain). I saw him perform the same show three times in the summer of 2019 (don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask), in support of the Chris album \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once in France, once at Primavera Sound in Barcelona, once in London. Rather than endlessly diminishing returns, I got to witness a pop star at the peak of their powers, capable of completely hypnotising a crowd with Michael Jackson-esque dance moves and raw emotion. If Redcar Les Adorables \u00c3\u2030toiles, their 2022 album under the guise of another alter ego, seemed scattershot and somewhat inaccessible (Letissier recently told Vulture that it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153got misunderstood, of course\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), Parano\u00c3\u00afa, Angels, True Love should act as something of a corrective. A 20-track, hour-and-a-half odyssey split over three CDs/vinyls for its physical release, it has the potential to completely overwhelm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the soundtrack for a film that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist. But, really, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more than enough plot in Letissier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life to provide context. Letissier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother died in 2019, not long after they went through a bruising breakup. The track People, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve Been Sad from their Vita Nuova EP perfectly captures the sting of loss, and of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153walking barefoot on glass\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And in 2021, Letissier came out as transgender, adding an extra layer of meaning to those early Christine tracks where he had been seemingly questioning gender as a concept, not necessarily questioning his own (on IT, he sang lines like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153she wants to be a man, a man / But she lies / She wants to be born again, again / But she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll lose\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Fast forward to 2023, and Letissier loses nothing by being who he is, only growing as an artist. The singles from Parano\u00c3\u00afa, Angels, True Love were striking, and the album \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all 96 minutes of it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is at once understated and shot through with unbridled emotion (it was inspired by Tony Kushner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s epic play Angels in America, set in Aids-era New York). On disc one, A Day in the Water is sparse but heartbreaking with a hint of R&amp;B and subtly pitched-up vocals, effectively as close to a Frank Ocean song as a Christine and the Queens song could be. Tears Can Be So Soft \u00e2\u20ac\u201c built around a slight Marvin Gaye sample \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a dramatic ode to giving in to the pain of loss, propelled by a lo-fi, trip-hop sound. Madonna (yes, Madonna!) appears on all three parts, a disembodied angelic voice who is in dialogue with Letissier, adding a starry quality but also co-signing his experimentation in the way that only someone who had the Ray of Light, William Orbit-era reinvention (and queer following) could do. Yes, this is a big pop album, written almost entirely in English, and Mike Dean, who has worked with Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9, Kanye and Lana Del Rey, is on production duty. Even so, it manages to feel intimate and authentic, Letissier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talent for channelling chaleur humaine still shining through as brightly as ever, as he lets his tears run freely.

Ap Iorwerth, who represents Ynys M\u00c3\u00b4n (Anglesey) and is a former journalist, was a deputy leader until Adam Price stepped down as head of the party last month and is also Plaid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesperson on health. When he announced his intention to stand for leader, he said the pro-independence party was at a crossroads and faced serious challenges over its culture. Price, heralded as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153once-in-a-generation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd leader, resigned last month after a report found a culture of sexual harassment, bullying and misogyny and made 82 recommendations of ways to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153detoxify\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the party. This week, Price\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessor as leader, Leanne Wood, said the next leader should be a woman, who she said would be better placed than a man to understand misogyny. But on Friday two of ap Iorwerth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential rivals, Sioned Williams and Si\u00c3\u00a2n Gwenllian, said that though they agreed with Wood, they would not be standing and would campaign for a new leadership model to help ensure equality. In a joint statement, they said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We agree with comments made by former leader Leanne Wood in an interview this week that a woman would have been the best choice to lead Plaid Cymru at this time. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will campaign to introduce a new model of joint leadership in the future which would be more inclusive and ensure equality. Last night a motion was unanimously passed by the Arfon Plaid Cymru constituency, calling on Plaid Cymru to explore creating a new co-leadership model for the future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our hope is that it will be discussed at the Plaid Cymru conference in the autumn. We however fully respect the outcome of the current process and support the new leader of the party when he is confirmed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unless one of the Senedd members changes their minds and stands, ap Iorwerth will become leader of Plaid on Friday 16 June. Ap Iorwerth was born in south Wales, brought up on Ynys M\u00c3\u00b4n and educated at Ysgol David Hughes on the island and at Cardiff University, where he graduated with a degree in politics and Welsh. He is married and has three children. In a video published on Twitter to announce he was standing, ap Iorwerth said Wales was on a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153journey to independence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now is the time to unite Plaid Cymru so we can lead the work of building a new future for Wales.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The image in this article was replaced on 9 June 2023.

Federal prosecutors have charged Donald Trump over his retention of national security documents and obstructing the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to retrieve them, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. It is a historic development that poses the most significant legal peril yet for the former president. The exact nature of the indictment, filed in federal district court in Miami, is unclear because it remains under seal and the justice department had no immediate comment. Trump confirmed the indictment on his Truth Social social media platform on Thursday afternoon, shortly after his lawyers received an email from prosecutors in the office of the special counsel, Jack Smith. It outlined the charges and summoned the former president to surrender himself to authorities in Miami next Tuesday. The charges listed in the summons included: wilful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document, corruptly concealing a document, concealing a document in a federal investigation, engaging in a scheme to conceal, and false statements, people familiar with the matter said. How has Trump reacted to the news? From his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, Trump lashed out at the indictment in a series of posts on Truth Social. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never thought it possible that such a thing could happen to a former President of the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I AM AN INNOCENT MAN!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Could Trump go to jail? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is often tempting to hype every Trump drama out of proportion and then lose sight of when something genuinely monumental has happened. Last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s action by the justice department was genuinely monumental,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes David Smith. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He really might be going to jail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What is the Trump Mar-a-Lago case about and why is it significant? The case marks the first time the justice department has charged Trump and adds to the mounting legal troubles he faces as he seeks to return to the presidency. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of where things stand. Julian Assange \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdangerously close\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to US extradition after losing latest legal appeal Julian Assange is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerously close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to being extradited to the US after losing his latest legal appeal, according to his family and observers of his long-running legal challenge. His lawyers say they will appeal again to the same court, amid growing fears Assange could spend the rest of his life in prison for publishing thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents. In a three-page judgment handed down in the UK high court on Tuesday, Justice Swift rejected all eight grounds of Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal against the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extradition order, signed by the then UK home secretary, Priti Patel, in June last year. But Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, Stella, said he would make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153renewed application for appeal to the high court\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd next week. The matter would then be heard before two new judges in a public hearing, she said. What else did she say? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We remain optimistic that we will prevail and that Julian will not be extradited to the United States where he faces charges that could result in him spending the rest of his life in a maximum security prison for publishing true information that revealed war crimes committed by the US government.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What did his appeal centre on? Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal argued that Patel, as home secretary, erred in her decision to approve the extradition order because the request violated the US-UK extradition treaty which states \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extradition shall not be granted if the offence for which extradition is requested is a political offence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His legal team has consistently maintained that the US desire to try Assange is politically motivated. Air pollution in US from wildfire smoke is worst in recent recorded history The US experienced its most toxic air pollution from wildfire smoke in its recent recorded history on Wednesday, researchers have found, with people in New York exposed to levels of pollution more than five times above the national air quality standard. The rapid analysis of the extreme event, shared with the Guardian, found that smoke billowing south from forest fires in Canada caused Americans to suffer the worst day of average exposure to such pollution since a dataset on smoky conditions started in 2006. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst by far, I mean, Jesus, it was bad,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Marshall Burke, an environmental scientist at Stanford University who led the work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to believe to be honest, we had to quadruple check it to see if it was right. We have not seen events like this, or even close to this, on the east coast before. This is a historic event.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Stanford researchers calculated that the average American on Wednesday was exposed to 27.5 micrograms per cubic meter of small particulate matter carried within the plumes of smoke. These tiny flecks of soot, dust and other burned debris, known as PM2.5, bury deep in the lungs when inhaled and are linked to a variety of health conditions and can cause deaths. What advice have Californians, who are used to living with wildfire smoke, given to those affected? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some tips for friends on the east coast: 1) Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go outside 2) Wear a mask if you must go outside 3) Run an air purifier all day and all night 4) AC should be in recirculate mode. Sincerely, a coast who deals with this crisis often,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for the California governor, said on Twitter. How long will it stay smoky? Toxic smoke from Canadian wildfires could linger over vast swaths of the US for days, officials warned, as millions of Americans remained under air pollution warnings. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening with the fires in Canada? Wildfire crews in Canada continue to battle hundreds of blazes across the country as air quality in major cities remains poor and other regions brace for intense heat. And as the country burns, experts warn Canada needs to do a better job of preparing its communities in areas increasingly prone to destructive blazes.

Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss this: Four controversial doctors helping Republicans attack trans healthcare On Wednesday, the governor of Missouri, Mike Parson, signed legislation to restrict gender-affirming care for minors, becoming the 20th US state in a nationwide wave targeting transgender healthcare. To promote their legislation, Republican politicians have turned to a handful of controversial doctors, all of whom have ties to rightwing groups and little experience of treating transgender patients. Every major medical association in the US has come out against such bans, stating that gender-affirming care should be available to those who need it, including minors.

This came amid a barrage of anti-solar and wind power measures pushed forward by Republicans to reshape a state that has become the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerhouse of clean energy. But the conservative lawmakers had help. Sections of the bill that impose new burdens upon clean energy providers were directly crafted and edited by the Texas Public Policy Foundation (or TPPF), a conservative group that has led the backlash against renewables and makes what it calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the moral case for fossil fuels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, according to a copy of the draft language seen by the Guardian.

The electronic devices simulate tobacco smoking, run on lithium batteries and are not rechargeable, meaning they are single-use products. Some estimates suggest about 1.3m are thrown away each week in the UK. The organisers of Glastonbury festival, which takes place from Wednesday 21 to Sunday 25 June at Worthy Farm in Somerset, have added disposable vapes to a list of items not to bring, which also includes knives, gazebos and non-biodegradable body glitter. Of disposable vapes, the website says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They pollute the environment and can be hazardous at waste centers (sic).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Industry experts said last month that disposable vapes were to blame for a dramatic rise in fires at recycling plants over the past year. Recycling firms are dealing with so many vapes that they are struggling to insure their facilities. Some are using artificial intelligence to detect vapes and their lithium-ion batteries, as well as installing thermal imaging cameras and automatic foam jets. On Friday the children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commissioner for England said disposable vapes should be banned and others sold in plain packaging to curtail the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wild west market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in e-cigarettes, which was damaging young people. Dame Rachel de Souza said she was worried that children felt under pressure to vape \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including avoiding using school toilets where it was happening \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153insidious these products are intentionally marketed and promoted to children\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Her comments echo those from England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, who in February attacked the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appalling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd marketing of vapes to children, saying it was clear some products were intended to appeal to underage youngsters. This week the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health also called for a ban on disposable vapes. It said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153youth vaping is fast becoming an epidemic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that e-cigarettes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are not a risk-free product and can be just as addictive, if not more so, than traditional cigarettes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is growing evidence that e-cigarettes carry significant health risks. While they do not contain the dangerous tar of conventional cigarettes, they do contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical with health risks. Some studies suggest nicotine is associated with cardiac and neurological diseases and with negative effects on the brain development of children and young people. Public health experts also worry that, compared with the use of gums and patches designed to wean people off smoking, vaping encourages long-term nicotine dependency."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/09/high-levels-drugs-water-pollution-study-england-south-coast", "primaryCategory": "environment", "title": "High levels of drugs found in sea off south England coast", "lead": "Study says marine life being harmed by prescription and recreational drugs in wastewater", "author": "Harriet Grant", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T10:22:06Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896697", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d316d286858a29363027ed4a70db9b014af11c79/0_248_4134_2481/500.jpg", "body": "A study looking at water pollution on the south coast of England has revealed high levels of potentially harmful chemicals including recreational drugs and antidepressants. Scientists involved in the research say marine life is being harmed by human drugs, pointing to evidence that oestrogen in water can feminise male fish through biological changes. Bianca Carr, the co-founder of the Clean Harbour Partnership (CHP) that coordinated the work, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to go beyond talking about poo in the water \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now we are looking at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in that human waste? Now we know the chemicals that are in it, the next step will be to look across the UK at what cocaine and other human drugs are doing to our water, to our food chain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Campaigners in Hampshire and Sussex joined forces with Portsmouth and Brunel University London to analyse hundreds of water samples across Chichester and Langstone harbours. In more than 288 samples, researchers have so far detected more than 50 compounds across 22 sites. These include pharmaceuticals and diabetes medicines as well as a chemical produced by the liver after cocaine use. The team also discovered pesticides, including some that are banned in the UK. Prof Alex Ford, from the University of Portsmouth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s school of biological sciences, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know there are billions of litres of sewage discharges annually around the UK but the impact of these discharges are not clearly understood. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This project is enabling us to determine what chemical contaminants are in our marine life and coastal waters. We have found a large variety of prescribed and illegal drugs plus a variety of pesticides in coastal waters and marine organisms, such as crabs and oysters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is important, because we know that aquatic ecosystems are under threat from pharmaceuticals and farming practices, such as biocides and fertilisers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ford has previously published research showing that even tiny quantities of antidepressants in water can affect wildlife, such as crustaceans and molluscs. Drugs will affect the behaviour and biological makeup of these creatures, including causing them to change colour or reproduce in a different way. Ford said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a staggering list of prescription drugs passed from humans to wastewater treatment plants and into receiving streams, estuaries, or oceans by direct consumption, metabolism and excretion or by toilet flushing of old prescriptions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The release of human pharmaceuticals into aquatic ecosystems is an environmental problem we should consider seriously.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The study also found E coli bacteria at high levels. A post-storm seawater sample taken from near an outflow pipe from Budds Farm sewage treatment works, near Langstone showed a reading of 380,000 colony forming units per 100ml of E coli, which is 760 times the safe levels set out under the European bathing water directive. The work is part of growing efforts around England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coast to highlight the dangers of water pollution. CHP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-founder, Rob Bailey, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thanks to community funding, we are starting to get an insight into the cocktail of chemicals polluting our seawater and their sources. Some pesticides seem to have been lingering for several years and the presence of partly digested antidepressants, drugs for type 2 diabetes and bladder infections is concerning. So little is known about their impact on marine life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Campaigners have been highlighting the amount of sewage entering Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seas in recent months. In April, figures from an analysis of Environment Agency data done by the Liberal Democrats showed that some popular beaches, including in Sussex, are affected particularly badly. One of the worst-hit was Brighton beach in East Sussex, where Southern Water discharged sewage 45 times last year, over more than 107 hours. At Meadfoot beach in Torquay, Devon, there were 79 dumps lasting 946 hours. Southern Water said removing chemical substances from wastewater was not asked for by the Environment Agency. The director of wastewater operations, John Penicud, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tackling chemicals and impurities, especially \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcforever chemicals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, is a global challenge that requires close collaboration of industry, agriculture and other sectors, including water companies and regulators. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our treatment processes already comply with stringent Environment Agency rules relating to the removal of contaminants, and we are working with partners to explore how we can go further \u00e2\u20ac\u201c through the use of cutting-edge technology and science, and investing in our network to improve treatment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/supreme-court-voting-rights-alabama", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "Why did the right-leaning supreme court hand Democrats a victory? | Moira Donegan", "lead": "Perhaps they know they need to preserve whatever is left of their legitimacy", "author": "Moira Donegan", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T10:10:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896699", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/04f02b806a9886078c4ba2e018878edd22b43b18/0_400_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "The supreme court shocked the nation on Thursday by doing something uncharacteristic, unexpected, and to many, downright confusing: they declined to eviscerate what remains of the Voting Rights Act. By the standards of the reactionary court, the result in Allen v Milligan, a challenge to an Alabama congressional district map that crams most of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 27% Black voting population into just one district, was downright astounding. Reaffirming a lower court, Scotus found that the map, which was drawn by the Republican-controlled Alabama state legislature after the 2020 census, illegally diluted the voting power of Black Alabamans, and that Alabama is now required to redraw its maps so that Black voters make up a majority of the electorate in a second district. Given the racially polarized voting patterns in Alabama and elsewhere, the decision virtually guarantees that Democrats will gain another congressional seat in Alabama in the 2024 election. The ruling was an especially surprising departure for Chief Justice John Roberts, who authored the 5-4 decision upholding section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Because both during his time on the court and for decades before it, Roberts has been a passionate opponent of voting rights broadly, and of the 1965 law\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prohibitions on racial gerrymandering in particular. Maybe this habitual distaste for the cause of Black ballot access is part of why the chief justice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinion, along with a concurrence from Brett Kavanaugh, who also joined the liberals in ruling against Alabama, contained limiting language that seemed to signal to Voting Rights Act opponents to try again. The Voting Rights Act, Roberts wrote, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may impermissibly elevate race in the allocation of political power within the states\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That is, it may be unconstitutional, according to Roberts, for Congress to intervene to redress America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history of racist political exclusion and disenfranchisement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our opinion today does not diminish or disregard these concerns. It simply holds that a faithful application of our precedents and a fair reading of the record before us do not bear them out here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It read almost like a plea to racial gerrymandering advocates from the chief justice: don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still on your side. Meanwhile Kavanaugh, who has developed an interesting habit of writing separately even when his reasoning does not differ substantially from that of his colleagues, hinted in his concurrence at a legal roadmap for Republicans to continue their attacks on the Voting Rights Act: by claiming that Congress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1982 amendment reaffirming the VRA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s section 2 protections is simply too old. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even if Congress in 1982 could constitutionally authorize race-based redistricting under section 2 for some period of time, the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kavanaugh wrote. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a handy trick the court likes to play: to say that Congress must act \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or in this case, that Congress must act again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to protect people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights, when the justices know that Congress, in its present state of gridlock and dysfunction, cannot act. And thus, policymaking power that should constitutionally belong to Congress is transferred, as if by magic, into the supreme court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands. So why did the supreme court decline to use that power in Milligan? Why not move to weaken section 2 even further? Why hand the Democrats \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who, in the interest of frankness, it should be acknowledged are the political and ideological opponents of six of the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nine justices \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a victory? In his opinion, Roberts makes a pean to the virtues of stare decisis, repeatedly scolding Alabama for their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attempt to remake our section 2 jurisprudence anew\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But Roberts himself has been all too eager to remake VRA jurisprudence as he sees fit, often with little regard for precedent. He did it dramatically almost exactly 10 years ago, with his opinion in 2013\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shelby County v Holder, which gutted section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, eliminating the pre-clearance regime that had required states with a history of racial discrimination in voting to have their redistricting maps approved at the federal level. It was this ruling that created the conditions for Alabama to draw their illegal congressional map in the first place. Shelby reasoned that section 5 was not necessary, because disenfranchised Black voters could still sue to restore their voting rights under the VRA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s section 2. But then the court cut back section 2 significantly, in 2021\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brnovich v Democratic National Committee, which made it much harder for plaintiffs to enforce the VRA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protections. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left of section 2, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, has been hobbling along, weakened and wounded, ever since. Even the now-illegal maps in Alabama have, in a way, already done their job: even though a district court had found that the map violated the Voting Rights Act, and even though the supreme court has now found the map to be illegal, Scotus still intervened ahead of the 2022 midterms to allow the racist gerrymander to be used in that election. This is part of why the court did not find it necessary to finally eliminate section 2: with voting rights already so diminished, and Republicans already ensconced in power in the House, it might have been easier for Roberts and Kavanaugh to resist the temptation to finish the job. There could have also been some more vulgar political concerns at play. A year after the supreme court eliminated the right to abortion and radically reshaped women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives and civil rights in Dobbs, the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s popularity is at a nadir. A series of ethics scandals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most notably Clarence Thomas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s luxury yacht trips, cushy real estate deals and great-nephew\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s private school tuition, all paid for by the rightwing billionaire Harlan Crow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have attached a stench of corruption to the justices. And the court is gearing up to issue a series of extreme, unpopular decisions in the coming weeks, which are poised to further radically reshape American life in ways the people do not want and did not vote for. The court is almost certain to begin unravelling public accommodations civil rights laws, by allowing businesses to discriminate against gay people. They are poised to ban affirmative action in college admissions. They have already struck blows to unions, and to the Clean Water Act. The decision to preserve the already dismal voting rights status quo may have been an attempt by Roberts to preserve what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left of the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legitimacy. But like voting rights, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already looking quite weak.

Although there is much fury in Kayleigh Hawkins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 staging for Her Productions, Unseemly Women and Girl Gang Manchester, there is too little sense of order being disrupted. Nor is there enough suggestion of a king whose arrogance and complacency are as much factors in his downfall as the ambitions of the next generation.

It is tempting to attribute this to the all-female and non-binary casting: this is the fifth such production in an annual series and does at least have the novelty of extending the range of weapons to include handbags and stilettos. But although you have to concentrate to remember who is playing male and who female (perhaps no more of a problem than with the all-male Lord Chamberlain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Men), the greater challenge is to figure out how they relate to each other and where the power lies.

Though the number of adults who believe this has declined since the insurrection, recent survey data from the University of Chicago reveal alarming and dangerous levels of support for political violence and conspiracy theories across the United States. The university\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chicago Project on Security &amp; Threats (CPOST) research center has been conducting Dangers to Democracy surveys of American adults on political violence and attitudes towards democracy since shortly after the January 6 attacks. In new data from April shared exclusively with the Guardian, researchers found a continued support for violence to achieve various political goals on both sides of the aisle, and a general distrust for democracy. The results are particularly alarming as the 2024 election approaches without essential safeguards that some lawmakers say could help prevent another violent attack on US democracy. For the next year and a half through the 2024 election, CPOST will be releasing new survey data tracking continued dangers to democracy every three months. The data will be published first with the Guardian. This data will be critical at a time when efforts to erode democracy feel increasingly prevalent in the United States, from candidates who deny the results of their elections to governmental taskforces attempting to prosecute people who unintentionally violate voting laws. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re heading into an extremely tumultuous election season,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who directs CPOST. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in the United States is political violence is going from the fringe to the mainstream.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The most recent survey from April 2023 found that an estimated 142 million Americans believe that elections won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most fundamental problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 111 million last September. And one in five American adults still believe that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, representing very little change from 2021. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing is really disturbing levels of distrust in American democracy, support for dangerous conspiracy theories, and support for political violence itself,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pape said. Pape said it was important to track sentiments about political violence, comparing it to the kindling for a wildfire. Though many were unaware that the events on January 6 would turn violent, research shows that public support for violence was widespread, so the attacks themselves should not have come as a surprise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once you have support for violence in the mainstream, those are the raw ingredients or the raw combustible material and then speeches, typically by politicians, can set them off,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Or if they get going, speeches can encourage them to go further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Before the January 6 insurrection, there was chatter on online forums and among far-right groups about potential political violence when Congress met to count electoral votes and certify Joe Biden the winner of the presidential election. But it was Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speech at the White House Ellipse that day that touched off the actual violence, Pape said. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to track public sentiment about political violence regularly. The instigating event, usually a speech or comment by a person in power, is unpredictable and can set people off at any moment, but the underlying support for violence is more predictable and trackable. The survey found that almost 14% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a minority of Americans, but still a significant number \u00e2\u20ac\u201c believe the use of force is justified to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153achieve political goals that I support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. More specifically, 12.4% believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s justified to restore the federal right to abortion, 8.4% believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s justified to ensure members of Congress and other government officials do the right thing, 6.3% think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s justified to preserve the rights of white Americans, and 6.1% believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s justified to prevent the prosecution of Trump. Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University and the author of a forthcoming book on public trust in the military, said that while public support for political violence might seem extreme, a confluence of factors is necessary for actual violence to occur \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is still rare. On January 6, there was a time-sensitive action, an already existing rally, and inciters including Trump who encouraged others to commit violence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You needed all of that at the same time to turn what would have been latent sentiment of the sort that this survey captures into actual violence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. In addition to wide support for Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big lie about the 2020 election, the survey also found that significant numbers of American adults believe conspiracy theories about the US government, and the number of believers has remained steady over almost two years. For example, 10% of American adults in April said they believe the government is run by Satan-worshipping pedophiles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The survey confirms what we already knew, which is that rhetoric is really hyperbolic in American political life,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Feaver said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can get folks to express support for pretty extreme statements.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An even greater percentage of American adults said they believe in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153great replacement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd theory, a white nationalist conspiracy theory that holds there is an active effort to replace white people with non-white populations, including immigrants and other people of color, in white-majority countries. While much of the survey reveals an alarming level of political polarization in the United States, there are areas where the majority of people do agree. Almost 55% of American adults feel like elections won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve our most fundamental political and social problems, and close to 50% believe political elites on both sides of the aisle are the most corrupt people in America. Perhaps more optimistically, the largest share of Americans believe in a potential solution to political violence. More than 77% think Republicans and Democrats in Congress should make a joint statement condemning any political violence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tremendous amount of opposition to political violence in the United States, but it is not mobilized,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pape said.

The impeachment of Texas attorney general Ken Paxton came as a shock to many, not just because of the nature of his alleged crimes, but because it is a rare instance of the party holding its own to account. William Flores, a political and social science professor at the University of Houston-Downtown called the situation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely historic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a Republican-led impeachment against one of the highest Republican leaders in the state. It is absolutely unprecedented, at least in recent times,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Flores said. The Republican-majority Texas congress had largely remained silent on Paxton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ethically questionable conduct that dates back before his first term in 2014, when the Texas state securities board fined him for violating financial laws. In 2020, things heated up when aides from his own office asked the FBI to investigate him. They alleged Paxton abused his power by accepting bribes in the form of donations from a real estate developer. They also claimed Paxton recommended that a wealthy donor to his campaign hire a woman with whom he was having an affair. When Paxton fired the staff members, they claimed he was unlawfully retaliating. In May, the house general investigating committee, composed of four Republicans and one Democrat, voted unanimously to recommend Paxton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impeachment. Twenty articles of impeachment were brought against him. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not surprising for politicians to be embroiled in a scandal, but it is unusual for Texas Republicans, who usually remain in lockstep, to eat their own. Paxton belongs to the most extreme wing of his party. He is the architect of some of the most severe voting restrictions imposed on the state, such as preventing most mail-in ballots and disbanding drive-through voting, two methods counties have tried to implement to make voting widely accessible. He established an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153election integrity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd division in his office that dedicates tens of thousands of hours to investigating voter fraud cases, despite no evidence that it is a widespread problem. More recently, Paxton launched an investigation into Austin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dell children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospital for the gender-affirming care it provided, which led to the swift departure of doctors from its adolescent unit, disrupting treatment not just for transitioning teens, but also those with cancer and eating disorders. He is now pursuing a similar investigation into the Texas children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospital, the largest such facility in the country. He also stands in staunch opposition to reproductive choice and federal immigration policy, and in firm support of gun rights despite the string of school mass shootings his state has suffered. In 2022, faced with a subpoena to testify in a lawsuit filed by abortion advocacy organizations at his doorstep, Paxton fled in a truck driven by his state senator wife, Angela Paxton. Animosity towards Paxton culminated when he tried earlier this year to use state funds to pay a legal settlement of over $3m to the former office members who blew the whistle on their boss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dealings. In order to use taxpayer dollars to pay legal fees for an elected official, the state legislature needs to give approval. But obtaining that approval was not as simple as Paxton might have hoped. If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one thing that can be counted on in tax-averse Texas, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less spending and limited government. And that extends to the Republicans in charge. House members Andrew Murr and Ann Johnson are some of the Republicans who drafted the articles of impeachment against Paxton, but also the two that serve on the far-right Texas Freedom Caucus. David Spiller, a Republican who also serves on the general investigation committee, began a statement with praise for the attorney general\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brilliant legal mind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a duty and obligation to protect the citizens of Texas from elected officials who abuse their office and their powers for personal gain. I cannot be complicit in condoning the improper actions of Attorney General Paxton. I cannot ignore it and pretend it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Even more atypical is the infighting now seen among party members. Hours before the investigation into Paxton was announced, Paxton called for the resignation of Republican house speaker Dade Phelan, whom he accused of drunken behavior while serving in office. Phelan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retort was presented through his spokesperson, who called Paxton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a last-ditch effort to save face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Abbott remains silent on the impeachment of his attorney general and the fault lines emerging within his party. The state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, offered a milquetoast statement which was neither informative nor indicative of where he stood. However, Donald Trump weighed in on the drama on the Truth Social social media platform in defense of Paxton. Trump wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Rino Speaker of the House of Texas, Dade Phelan, who is barely a Republican at all and failed the test on voter integrity, wants to impeach one of the most hard working and effective Attorney Generals in the United States, Ken Paxton, who just won re-election with a large number of American Patriots strongly voting for him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although the spectacle has shaken up the party, Flores said not much will change within the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican party regardless of if Paxton gets ousted or not. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The red meat kind of issues that go to the core and are very popular not only in the state of Texas, but with conservatives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a national playbook,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Flores said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Texas is filled with with contradictions, but the conservatives are pretty unified around conservative issues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now, a senate trial will be held no later than 28 August. A two-thirds majority is needed to remove Paxton from office, including possibly one vote from his wife who has yet to recuse herself due to an unethical conflict of interest. In the event that happens, Abbott will be forced to appoint his permanent replacement and Texas will see the historic toppling of a leader not seen before in the state."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/09/rent-control-comeback-america-massachusetts", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA blessing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: is rent control making a comeback in America?", "lead": "Most renters spend more than a third of their income on rent, leading cities like Boston to introduce measures to stabilize rents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not without opposition", "author": "Paige Curtis in Boston", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T10:00:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896711", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9199d582a03bc9be3c6d4bd9192df7ef6c2491ab/0_0_1500_900/500.jpg", "body": "For Paula Coar, rent control was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blessing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Coar lived in a rent-controlled apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with her sister and their children for over a decade in the 1980s and 1990s and credits the policy for the opportunities she was able to provide to her children. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rent control enabled us to have additional income left over, so I was able to send my children to a local private school, and later on a historically Black college, that invested more in Black students,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Coar, who worked as a technician at Polaroid at the time. At its highest, her three-bedroom rent-controlled apartment in Cambridge was $1,200 a month \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the equivalent of $3,433 today. (The median monthly rent for a three-bedroom unit in the same neighborhood today is $4,195.) While not cheap, one of the chief advantages was that any increases in rent had to be approved in advance by the local rent control board, which established a finite maximum rent for every unit in the city. But then rent control disappeared in Massachusetts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it was banned in many other places in the US, too. Is it now on its way back in a slightly different form? The allure of rent control is clear. Most renters now spend more than a third of their income on rent each month (a benchmark that signifies they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rent-burdened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). Even residents who pay rent on time are subject to the whim of landlords legally entitled to raise rent prices as they see fit. And when households cannot afford these increases, they face the threat of eviction. US landlords file 3.6m eviction cases each year. Proponents are not arguing that any increase in rent is unfounded. Owning property comes with increasing expenses from inflation and overhead costs from maintenance. But with rent-controlled or stabilized housing, residents know when to expect these increases and have a system through which to contest them. Earlier this year, in response to the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affordable housing crisis, Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s city council voted to introduce measures that would stabilize rents, though the move is facing opposition. Pro-rent regulation coalitions have gained traction in other cities, as lawmakers in Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon and California have pondered efforts to introduce or tighten caps on rent increases. The Boston city councilor Kendra Lara, who supports Boston\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rent ordinance, said that since the state ban in 1994, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our understanding of what rent control means, what it looks like, and the impact it can have on communities has grown leaps and bounds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ultimately having a conversation about whether families can afford to have a roof over their heads.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If rent regulation has a resurgence, it would cap a precipitous fall from grace. Rent control laws in the US date back to the 1920s, and took off most prominently in New York. After the second world war, housing officials hoped to secure affordable housing for returning veterans and a burgeoning class of skilled laborers. Experts refer to this period as the first generation of rent control, and it entailed a hardline freezing of rent prices so they could not increase. There were over 1m rent-controlled units in New York City, for instance, in the 1950s, but today there are less than 22,000. This is why Sophie House, the law and policy director of New York University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Housing Solutions Lab, calls it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the more mythical option\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this lingering cultural image of the little old lady who pays $200 a month for a rent-controlled unit she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had since 1960. In truth, that applies to a very small amount of remaining units.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd By the 1970s, the second-generation model had taken hold: rent stabilization. While rent control fixes rents at a specific dollar amount, stabilization policies limit yearly rent increases to a certain percentage through a regulated process. Most towns with rent regulation abandoned the policies by the 1990s, citing disadvantages for the real estate market, a common one being that the policy disincentivizes new home construction and dissuades landlords from maintaining their properties. Massachusetts cities and towns such as Boston, Brookline and Cambridge held on. But Boston landlords claimed that financially privileged tenants who could afford to pay market values for their apartments abused the system. Soon after, a coalition of property owners introduced a ballot initiative to overturn rent control at the state level. Citizens in 351 Massachusetts towns and suburbs were given a vote on whether to outlaw a policy that affected only three cities \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the policy was indeed overturned. Soon after the eradication of rent control in Massachusetts other states, such as Tennessee and Illinois, followed suit with laws that prohibited cities and towns from establishing rent control in 1996 and 1997 respectively. Such pre-emption laws now cover much of the US, according to the Urban Institute. Massachusetts, though, is heading in the opposite direction. Its state rent stabilization bill would limit allowable rent increases to the rate of inflation with a cap at 5% per year, and excludes newly constructed units for the first five years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so as not to drive down new construction. But the opposition is steep. The broaching of rent control by Mayor Michelle Wu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration prompted the Greater Boston Real Estate Board to invest $400,000 in an anti-rent control campaign. Jim Lapides, vice-president of advocacy and strategic communications for the National Multifamily Housing Council, whose membership consists of private landlords and commercial real estate developers, believes rent control is a Band-Aid solution that won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t result in more affordable rent for those who need it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Politicians are looking for an expedient solution to say they addressed the housing crisis so they can get re-elected,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lapides. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Expanding housing choice voucher programs, which are underutilized, is a much better way to help families that need rental assistance,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, referring to a federal assistance program that subsidizes rent for low-income residents. (Only one in four people who qualify for federal housing assistance currently receive support.) Activists, on the other hand, say drastic solutions are needed immediately. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rent control is an anti-displacement tool,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Andres Del Castillo, a lead organizer at City Life/Vida Urbana, a non-profit organization that supports tenants fighting for affordable and safe housing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not centered on housing production, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s focused on the issue of real people being displaced right now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that rent stabilization laws do help residents in protected units remain in place. But their broader effects are ambiguous. Do they disincentivize developers to build more units? Or, on the other hand, do they improve economic opportunities for tenants and reduce racial inequality? The evidence for all of this is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mixed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, experts say. Amid this uncertainty, some efforts have foundered. After outlawing rent control in 1981, the Colorado state legislature this year considered a bill that would have granted cities the power to set their own rent regulation policies. But the proposal failed amid concerns from some lawmakers that it would suffocate new development. In Oregon, where lawmakers capped rent hikes in 2019 to no more than 7% plus the inflation rate, there have been calls for amendments to the bill, capping increases at just 3% plus inflation. That proposal has been weakened. In Massachusetts, the proposal must be reviewed by the legislature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s housing committee, which includes a hearing at which the public can weigh in. The committee will decide whether the bill will be put up for a vote in the statehouse. All the while, the stakes feel visceral. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Myself and my three daughters are living with rodents, cockroaches and lead in our apartment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suneyda Mejia proclaimed to a crowd of protesters on the steps of her apartment building. Earlier this year her landlord had threatened her with eviction after she resisted a $400 rent hike despite the poor condition of the building. She is hoping the landlord will negotiate a fairer rental agreement with the tenants. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We cannot continue paying rent increases while living in such bad conditions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lucia Guardado, another of the tenant organizers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must fight for rent control.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Read more about our housing project here"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/09/houseplant-of-the-week-false-shamrock", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "title": "Houseplant of the week: false shamrock", "lead": "Its deep purple, triangular foliage is an eye-catching contrast to the greens of your other plants", "author": "Gynelle Leon", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T10:00:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896716", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/30a51531ae1db6f28452e5d5bdd696bf58292be9/0_173_5184_3110/500.jpg", "body": "Why will I love it?

Hannah Nugent, a Brooklyn-based practitioner, said that about a quarter of their clients come in for issues related to eco-anxiety. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hopelessness is a feeling that I am helping my clients manage and cope with this week,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of them are grieving the loss of a hopeful future, because it is increasingly hard for many of them to imagine a secure future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A few years ago, most of the people who utilized climate therapists fit a certain stereotype: they were young and they were activists or people who felt a strong connection to the natural world.

Greenspun said she usually got more inquiries into her climate-conscious therapy practice after periods of intense weather. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get an uptick in referrals after a heatwave, when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 90 degrees for a number of days,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These events can break down the defense mechanisms people build up around their climate fears.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Not every discussion in the climate psychologist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office is entirely negative. Some of Greenspun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients expressed a glimmer of hope this week, saying that the smoke might open more eyes to the immediacy of the crisis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is this feeling that more people are waking up to this, and could become engaged in activism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If more people realize that this is serious, there will be a greater sense of solidarity.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/09/cop-city-cost-atlanta-city-council", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Real cost of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCop City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 under question after Atlanta approves millions of dollars for project", "lead": "Opponents call process \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcanti-democratic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after public participation in council meeting difficult and lack of transparency", "author": "Timothy Pratt in Atlanta", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T10:00:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896722", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ef811c287795a23e5e736b9c39c88d5dc50666cf/0_0_7209_4327/500.jpg", "body": "Questions remain about the real cost of the giant police and fire department training center known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cop City\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after the Atlanta city council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approval of millions of dollars for the project in a process that opponents have called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anti-democratic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The 11-4 vote in favor of giving $67m to the project on Tuesday morning came on the heels of 14 hours of public comment against the idea. It played out as city policies made public participation in the council meeting more difficult, and after several council members decided to reject postponing a decision on the money, apparently because they were tired of facing public questioning. These were only the latest in a series of developments highlighting the project\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of transparency, including the recent revelation that it will cost taxpayers more than twice what the city has said for nearly two years. Cop City came to global attention after police shot dead Manuel Paez Ter\u00c3\u00a1n, an environmental protester, in a raid on the forest and its defenders on 18 January \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first incident of its kind in US history. The state says Paez Ter\u00c3\u00a1n shot first; the case is with a special prosecutor. Paez Ter\u00c3\u00a1n, also known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tortuguita\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, was one of dozens who had occupied a public park in the forest near where the training center is planned, to protest against the project. The so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forest defenders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were perhaps the most visible part of a broad-based movement against Cop City that has only grown in the nearly two years since the city council approved it in September 2021. At the time, Atlanta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, announced that the center would cost taxpayers $30m, paid in a one-time sum or in a $1m-a-year \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leaseback\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd arrangement over 30 years. But on 24 May, the Atlanta Community Press Collective \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a project formed as a watchdog over Cop City \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reported the city was actually planning on doing both. The city owns land in the forest where the center is planned, including the 171-acre footprint where it will be built. Nonetheless, it will now pay $30m plus $1.2m a year during 30 years to the Atlanta Police Foundation, the organization behind the project \u00e2\u20ac\u201c putting the total estimated cost to the city at $67m. It remains unclear what the project\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153second phase\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will cost \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including a 911 call center and a park \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and who will pay for it. Council member Liliana Bakhtiari \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose district is closest to the South River forest site and was one of four who voted against the funding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were told the entire time the cost would be $30m \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and it was always painted as either/or\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c referring to the lump sum and leaseback arrangements. Bakhtiari said she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153came to find out that [the leaseback] was buried in amendments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the 2021 agreement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is what makes me upset \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say the real amount, the details involved,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bakhtiari said. Meanwhile, Tim Franzen, with the American Friends Service Committee in Atlanta, worked with the city for weeks to ensure the unprecedented number of attendees at a city council meeting could enter the building, bring food and drinks, leave if needed, and sign up for public comment. Instead, doors to city hall opened two hours later than usual, police didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow food or drink inside the building and kept people waiting outside for hours. The city also only provided one sign-up sheet for hundreds of people, ensuring that some were left out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So much about what happened seemed so anti-democratic,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Franzen, who was later able to resolve most of the issues after meetings with council members. In the end 357 people signed up to make public comment. Speakers gave first-hand accounts of police brutality, laid out arguments about the forest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s importance to Atlanta amid climate change and expressed alarm over the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent arrests of legal fund organizers. In the pre-dawn hours, several rounds of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let them speak\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chants resulted in dozens more being allowed to address the council. On Monday night Bernice King, daughter of Martin Luther King Jr, tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153How can any Atlanta City Council member vote \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYES\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on Cop City funding and live with their conscience after hearing today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Public Comments, many of which were passionate, love-centered, powerful, and inspiring?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nonetheless, more than nine hours later, shortly after 5am on Tuesday, the council voted down a proposal to send the issue back to committee to get clarity on questions such as cost. Franzen said he heard from several council members that they rejected the measure because they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to face another record-breaking onslaught of their constituents. Minutes later, at 5.22, the council voted 11-4 to approve the funding. Notably, the 14 hours of public comment against the project and an 11-4 vote in favor of it are nearly identical to those of the council meeting when the plan was approved two years ago. At that time, most of 17 hours of recorded public comment opposed the project and the vote in favor was 10-4. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as if the needle didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move with the city council and the mayor since then,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Franzen said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even though the needle has moved in a huge way in terms of public opinion. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as if they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t acknowledge it, or see it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/09/therapists-reveal-20-truths-and-myths-about-relationships", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "title": "Never go to bed on an argument \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and 19 other relationship \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unpicked by experts", "lead": "Is it wrong to flirt with other people?

Also, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re having bad sex with someone in the beginning, why would you want to carry on?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Your partner should know what you feel/need FALSE This is one of those saccharine myths we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been sold by romantic fairytales. However close you are to someone, says Joanna Harrison, divorce lawyer-turned-couples-therapist and author of Five Arguments All Couples (Need to) Have, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never be able to second-guess them on everything. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And why would you want to? That would be boring. Also, people change; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all evolving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What matters is that you each share what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re feeling, you listen to one another, and you try to see things from your partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view. No relationship can survive an affair FALSE There are many kinds of affair, and this, says Abse, is key. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An affair can be an exit strategy, sure. But it can also be a protest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a way of bringing your partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention to something that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working for you in the relationship. If it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that kind of affair, and you can work through why it happened with your partner, you can move on from it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c providing apologies are given, reparations are made and forgiveness is forthcoming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A relationship is stronger if you share a bed FALSE The important thing isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t whether you share a bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking about why if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, says Harrison. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s down to snoring or young kids, sleeping in separate beds reduces the intimate time you get together. So you need to discuss how you can compensate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Make love on the sofa in the evening when the kids have gone to sleep. If snoring has driven you to separate rooms, at least have your morning tea in bed together. Never go to bed on an argument FALSE So often, says Terrence Real, family therapist and author of Us: Getting Past You and Me to Build a More Loving Relationship, rows happen because one or both partners have been drinking, or they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not feeling good, or it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re both tired. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What I say is: you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to resolve anything tonight. Go to bed, and the next morning have a cup of tea together and talk it through.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd All relationships are about the cycle of closeness, disruption and return to closeness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our culture worships the harmony phase, but a good relationship thrives on surviving the mess. The work of intimacy is the collision of imperfections, and how we manage those.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong to flirt with other people TRUE You can be playful with someone, says Real, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but if you look into their eyes, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a difference between the shades being down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshop closed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the signal \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccome hither\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. And if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using the sexual energy between you and someone else to feel excited, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a mini-affair.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The rule is this, says Real: if your partner could hear you, and the way you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re speaking would upset them, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not OK. People can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change FALSE. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in the personality transplant business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Real. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Therapy is about understanding why we behave as we do, and making conscious decisions to change things in order to hang on to someone we care about.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Relate therapist Simone Bose, who runs her own practice, agrees that people can change, but they have to want to, and that means confronting aspects of themselves that might be uncomfortable or painful. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardest is overcoming the defensive mechanism you have as default,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. Having arguments doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be bad TRUE If an argument escalates to violence or one partner feeling unsafe, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong, and you need expert help. But as you learn the landscape of your partner, says Harrison, arguments show you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re working each other out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re finding out what your partner is passionate about, and sharing that. So these disagreements are full of useful information about what matters to each of you. If couples stop talking about what they care about, and sometimes arguing about it, they can start to feel disconnected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is out there somewhere FALSE \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is demonstrably nonsense: you only have to look at the people who find love again after losing their partner,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Real. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We tend to fall in love with a person who we subliminally believe is going to heal us, give us what we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in our early life. Relationships tend to replay situations we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in before. We fall in love with what completes us, in other words. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this feeling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that we \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfit together\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that makes us feel we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A successful relationship comes down to rewriting the script, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not playing out things that went wrong in the past. Once a cheater, always a cheater TRUE and FALSE What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most interesting about cheating, says Real, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t why someone does it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obvious (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exciting, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sexy, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a thrill). No: the interesting thing is why someone doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cheating is always selfish: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always about overriding what you should do. So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned from it and moved on, then no, you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily be a cheater again. But your partner might never feel 100% assured you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it again. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to understand that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Marriage is just a piece of paper FALSE \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The question I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ask a couple,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Real, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is: who is your community? Who is supporting you, and how have you signalled you need that support, that you value it for your relationship?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Few rituals are left in modern life, he says, and a marriage ceremony is one that includes others as well as the couple themselves. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something transformative about it being an experience embedded in the community,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why it mattered to fight for the legal right for gay couples to marry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If a relationship needs therapy, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late FALSE Individuals are complicated, and partners who love one another and can see there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential for an ongoing relationship can also see there are stumbling blocks, says Bose. Having therapy, especially quite early on in a relationship, can ensure they get across those hurdles without the relationship being damaged. On the other hand, she cautions against therapy that goes on and on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some couples are scared to leave \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to be able to carry on without that crutch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You should always own up if you cheat TRUE and FALSE You should usually confess, but not always, says Abse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about a one-night stand on a business trip, maybe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s OK, and better not to share it with your partner. But if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a longer-term relationship with someone else and you never reveal it to your partner, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re avoiding something. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to leave you in a sad place because you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have lost that sense that you and your partner share your deepest feelings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You have to agree on politics FALSE If politics matters deeply to you then yes, says Bose, you need to be aligned. But if it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, voting for different political parties probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t unseat your relationship to any extent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Much more important is sharing the same values: what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to you, what you truly believe matters. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t agree on values, it seeps into your everyday life and can affect your relationship at a very deep level.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Relationship problems always come down to money or sex FALSE \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In fact, they always come down to one thing: communication,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Harrison. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Money and sex are taboo subjects in many families, and we all bring our family baggage to any relationship. But the issues aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about these things per se, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about being able to talk about these things \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and everything else that matters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always obvious when a relationship is over FALSE Even for an experienced therapist like Joanna Harrison, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s often not clear whether a couple are going to make it through. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Individuals have different thresholds for what they can deal with in a relationship,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no absolutes, no moment where it has to be all over.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You need to have lots in common FALSE In fact, says Abse, unconsciously we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for someone who has attributes we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re lacking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because being with them helps us to learn different ways, and to grow our characters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a shy kind of person, you might find yourself attracted to someone gregarious.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It also means you can rely on the other person for those things \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the yin/yang thing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A relationship is often more interesting and dynamic where there are challenges and differences.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You need regular date nights FALSE It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not date nights that matter, says Harrison, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time together. So you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to spend money or go out or have a treat (though that might be lovely). The bit your relationship needs is time shared as a couple: snuggled together on the sofa watching TV or a walk in the park can be every bit as good as a pricey meal out. A baby will jeopardise your relationship TRUE It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to hope a child who shares your genes, who you created together, will bond you and keep your relationship going. But, says Abse, relationship satisfaction goes down in the early weeks, months and years after the arrival of a baby. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having a baby changes everything \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t underestimate that. You lose freedom, you lose autonomy, you lose intimacy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really challenging time for a couple.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can have a good sex life for ever FALSE Viagra has sold us this idea, says Abse, and sure, in theory there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason why sex should ever stop.

This was in July. They wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be delivered until October, wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t emerge from the earth that winter and possibly, I read, might not bloom at all the next spring. Nevertheless, I was determined: my balcony had offered neither the sunshine nor space to grow peonies. Gaining ground gave me both. You would be hard-pushed to find a blousier flower. Ruffles of petals make up ample handfuls of blooms from May through to the hazy days of early summer. The flowers can be simple and bowl-like (the deep red \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcChocolate Soldier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122), reminiscent of anemones (the otherworldly \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcInstituteur Doriat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) or explosively frilly (hello, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSarah Bernhardt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). They also range in colour from white to red to yellow, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the blushing pastel pink that you will spot most often on Instagram and in wedding bouquets, where peonies have become a millennial fave. There are three types: the tree peony (actually a shrub that will retain its woody growth throughout the year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good for a sheltered corner in a larger garden); herbaceous peonies, which die back over the colder months to return the following year; and intersectional hybrids \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a combination of the two that are harder to come by. For such a fancy-looking flower, peonies are surprisingly hardy and, with patience, reliable to grow. They will be available in bloom in garden centres now but you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re better off placing an order for bare-root herbaceous ones, which are best planted in a bright bed upon delivery in the autumn. Much fuss is made about how deep peonies should be planted: if they are too far beneath the surface they will be reluctant to flower. As long as the top \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or crown \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of a bare root plant (they will usually have the beginnings of tiny little leaves) is between 2.5cm and 5cm deep, you will be all right. Digging in some peat-free compost before you plant will help. Tree peonies appreciate a sheltered spot and are happier than herbaceous peonies if you have acid soil \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both prefer it higher up the pH scale. The larger challenge with peonies is whether a few glorious days of Barbara Cartland-worthy blooms can justify the square footage they occupy. I love seeing their scarlet alien stems emerge above the ground in January, but they have a lot of rather pedestrian foliage for an urban garden. This year I uprooted mine to a large tub while I decided if I could continue to grant them space. They have flowered beautifully, but it has been a swan song. This autumn I will be donating them to a friend, who is happy to add them to her more generous beds."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/09/readers-favourite-welness-retreats-in-the-uk-and-europe", "primaryCategory": "travel", "title": "From DJ classes in Ibiza to yoga in the Norfolk woods: readers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 favourite retreats in the UK and Europe", "lead": "Ecodomes, poolside lounging and meditation feature at these gorgeous retreats in the UK and sunny southern Europe", "author": "Guardian readers", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T10:00:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896731", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9679eeabc3abd35fd91b481f1a29ea0a56774cdf/0_0_1920_1152/500.jpg", "body": "Relax in an ecodome, Lincolnshire I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just returned from the most relaxing weekend at Purusha Retreats, south of Lincoln. From the moment we headed up the grassy, tree-lined driveway we knew we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d arrived in relaxation heaven. Set in a countryside location, we slept in private ecodomes, each with hammocks, a wood-fired hot tub, a private shower and compost loo. Eco-friendly toiletries are provided. Each dome is set apart from the others for complete privacy. The communal spaces are equally beautiful, set around a small lake. Walks are marked around the site. Mornings are a joy of birdsong and evenings are delightful under the stars. Clare Foyle Mud and waters, Emilia-Romagna, Italy Sometimes the best travel discoveries are found by chance and the wellness retreat at Salsomaggiore Spa was a case in point for me. While vainly attempting to follow the Tour of Italy cycle route on my own two-wheeler, I pulled up in the verdant hills of Emilia-Romagna with back strain. A local waitress pointed me to the elegant town of Salsomaggiore Terme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The waters cure your everything,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. How right she was. A day later I was in a lovely, naturally heated pool surrounded by Italian housewives enchanted by my English accent, waiting for some mud to be caked on my dodgy back.

Highly recommend. Sarah Meditation and mindfulness, Devon A week on retreat at the Barn Retreat, part of the fantastic Sharpham Estate near Totnes, is a gift I give myself every year. Walk a couple of miles from Totnes, along a gorgeous footpath to the Barn, leaving behind the stresses of everyday life. Learn to meditate and do Qigong each morning as the sun rises above the river valley. Do mindful gardening. Help prepare and eat healthy, delicious food. Or just rest. Spend time napping or walking in the glorious Devon countryside, or sit and watch the River Dart flow past. Simply beautiful in all seasons, always inclusive and welcoming, with retreats from \u00c2\u00a3375. Jane Sleep and sun, Venice My best ever solo spa retreat was to the Almar Jesolo resort at Lido di Jesolo, right on the beach and about an hour by bus and boat to Venice. The hotel offered a healthy dining menu in a relaxed, informal setting. I took a sleep package which included yoga, massages, and heavenly facials. The saunas, spa, pools and steam rooms were beautifully luxurious and my stunning room had beach views. I took a day out to explore Venice and loved the beachside location to top up my tan too.

The court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise 5-4 ruling means that Alabama will have to redraw its congressional map to add another district where Black voters comprise a majority of the district\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voting age population. Under the Republican plan rejected by the court, Black voters have a majority in just one of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven congressional districts, despite representing about a quarter of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population. That is the only congressional district in the state represented by a Democrat. The decision has implications in Alabama and beyond. A three-judge panel in Louisiana last year ordered the state to draw an additional majority-Black district, but the supreme court halted that ruling while it considered the Alabama case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You could see new maps in several of these southern states where Black and other minority voters have really been underrepresented for some time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said David Daley, a redistricting expert and senior fellow at FairVote, an organization that promotes electoral reform. The supreme court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling upholds section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, a provision that prohibits voting procedures that discriminate on the basis of race. There are 31 cases with section 2 claims pending in 10 states, including Georgia, Mississippi and Texas, according to a tally by Democracy Docket, a left-leaning organization. The supreme court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on Thursday does not necessarily mean that plaintiffs in all of those cases will prevail because section 2 cases are notoriously fact-specific and often turn on the specific demographics, turnout and geography of a state. In his opinion on Thursday, Roberts noted that few section 2 cases ultimately prevail. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since 2010, plaintiffs nationwide have apparently succeeded in fewer than ten \u00c2\u00a72 suits,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. Still, there are likely to be huge political consequences. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The landmark decision in Allen v Milligan could reverberate across the deep south, leading to the creation of new Black-majority, strongly Democratic seats in multiple states,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dave Wasserman, an analyst for the non-partisan Cook Political Report, wrote in a blogpost. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Politically, the ruling could shake up the 2024 battle for the House, send shockwaves beyond Alabama and potentially offset a new gerrymander Republicans are likely to impose in North Carolina. The key states to watch are Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia and South Carolina.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Cook Political Report immediately changed its prediction for the partisan results in four districts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two in Alabama and two in Louisiana \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from favoring Republicans to being a tossup. It also shifted one district in North Carolina currently represented by a Democrat to be more Democratic friendly. The site cautioned that the exact predictions would depend on how the lines were drawn. Republicans currently have a majority of a few seats in the US House. In a statement, Ashley Shelton, president of the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice, a Louisiana civic engagement organization, noted the consequences of the ruling for Louisiana voters and said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with this legal precedent, we will continue to make fair representation possible in Louisiana\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/09/network-ten-apologises-to-jacinta-nampijinpa-price-over-leaked-lisa-wilkinson-recording", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Network Ten apologises to Jacinta Nampijinpa Price over leaked Lisa Wilkinson recording", "lead": "Audio features Wilkinson seemingly mocking the Coalition by questioning the senator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preselection and struggling to pronounce her name", "author": "Caitlin Cassidy", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T09:35:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896738", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7acb4abb0dc7e3ce621fcef3a75617c65648a4a3/377_0_5171_3103/500.jpg", "body": "Jacinta Nampijinpa Price has been offered a private apology from Network Ten after audio was leaked of host Lisa Wilkinson making disparaging comments about the Indigenous senator.

Lautaro Mart\u00c3\u00adnez has spells when he cannot score \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as happened in the World Cup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but when he is hot he is hot, and he has scored 11 times in his past 13 games. He will probably be partnered by Edin Dzeko, now 37 but still an effective, intelligent and underrated target man. Romelu Lukaku then offers an unpredictable element from the bench. Modern centre-backs face a front two only rarely. Against a single striker, one central defender can mark and one drop off as cover; when both have to mark the challenge is different. City faced a front two on eight occasions in the league this season, winning five, drawing one and losing two. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small sample size, but it is at the very least intriguing that City kept just two clean sheets in those games (25%), as opposed to 11 in the 30 (36.7%) against sides playing a single striker. On a more practical level, playing against two central forwards makes it a bigger risk for John Stones to step up from centre-back into midfield. In only one of those eight games did Stones play in his hybrid role, but that was against Southampton in a match City won 4-1 (and in which Kyle Walker replaced him 11 minutes after half-time), which makes it extremely difficult to know how Pep Guardiola may address the challenge. There were 12 minutes plus injury time of Wout Weghorst alongside Marcus Rashford in the FA Cup final, but the shape of the game and the fact City were protecting a lead means that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much of a guide either. It could be that Stones starts at full-back and goes into midfield from there, assuming Federico Dimarco doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too far forward from wing-back. Or it may be that Stones simply operates as a more orthodox central defender. City against a back three Back threes are far more common than front twos these days; City have come up against them 13 times in the league this season. Those matches have yielded 2.15 points per game, appreciably less than the 2.44 points per game City picked up in their other 25 games, which may be because the best way to thwart Erling Haaland is to get players around him. That theory seems to be contradicted by the fact that Haaland has scored 11 goals from open play in those 13 games, but seven of them (plus a penalty) came in the first four, against Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest and Brighton; he has four in the nine games since. There is another intriguing detail here, albeit one that must be caveated by pointing out the extremely low sample size, and that is that City have played four times against teams who play a 5-3-2 similar to Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (acknowledging that the difference between 5-3-2 and 3-4-1-2 is often minimal or in the eye of the beholder). City beat Forest 6-0, but have also drawn against Frank Lampard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Everton (albeit slightly freakishly) and twice lost to Brentford (albeit once with a weakened team on the final day of the season). Can Inter get their 5-3-2 operating like Brentford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s? There is a clear problem up front. Where Brentford could use a very mobile front two in Bryan Mbeumo and either Ivan Toney or Yoane Wissa, Inter are more restricted: neither Dzeko nor Lukaku offers that sort of dynamism. But perhaps the bigger lesson from Brentford is that a team sitting deep can frustrate City so long as Haaland doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dominate in the air, so long as space isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offered behind the full-backs (which is how Real Madrid were undone as Bernardo Silva got the better of Eduardo Camavinga) and so long as at least some threat is offered on the break. Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wing-backs and the Brentford Protocol It says something about the modern financial landscape that it makes sense to tell one of the sides in the Champions Leaguefinal that they need to be more like Brentford, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true. Brentford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s win at the Etihad Stadium in November was the most convincing display any side put in against City all season \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although admittedly before the Stones reinvention. The key was the pace at which they were able to break \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always a potential way of getting at any Guardiola side \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not only through the front two but also through Rico Henry, the left wing-back, who forced Silva to track back by driving forward when Brentford won the ball. Dimarco managed four goals and three assists in the league last season and Denzel Dumfries one goal and four assists. Both wing-backs are clearly capable of getting forward but whether they can do that and shut down City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flanks is another matter. The centre Given the probability that Inter will sit deep, with a back five to combat City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three forwards, that probably means a deep three-man block in midfield of Nicol\u00c3\u00b2 Barella, Marcelo Brozovic and Hakan Calhanoglu. Their job will largely be to clog up the area and prevent Kevin De Bruyne or Ilkay G\u00c3\u00bcndogan having time or space, with Stones potentially adding a fourth central body to complicate the issue. But Inter are fortunate that all three are capable passers who may be able to spring a counter, either using the width offered by the wing-backs or going direct to Dzeko and Mart\u00c3\u00adnez. City, almost certainly, will have the middle of the pitch to themselves."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/09/es-flo-review-devoted-couple-contend-with-the-brutality-of-dementia", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Es & Flo review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c devoted couple contend with the brutality of dementia ", "lead": "Tender portrait of a woman caring for her love \u00e2\u20ac\u201c joy and affection seep through performances that ache with the tragedy of seeing your partner slip away", "author": "Kate Wyver", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T09:32:30Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896745", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b65105619cbf93cd73cd63c22b7005cee2a70033/0_156_8256_4954/500.jpg", "body": "Es and Flo dance in the kitchen, their knees tucked tightly together, their hands clasped around each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backs.

Jennifer Lunn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play knocks at the door of Liz Crowther\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spritely Es and Doreene Blackstock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s protective Flo. The pair have stood side by side for 40 years, from the community chaos of Greenham Common to the happy haven of the home they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shared and shaped together (delicately designed by Libby Watson). But as Es starts showing symptoms of dementia, everything they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve built together begins to unravel. Having hidden their relationship from her family and never officially married, everything is in Es\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name; Flo could be swept aside with no control over her partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future care. Deceptively sweet, this domestic drama hits all the hideous beats of a typical tale of dementia. As Flo struggles to accept help, it is strikingly clear that there is no right answer or easy option \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this is without money even being an issue. Under Susie McKenna\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s direction, the performances ache with how hard it can be to see your loved one slip away, and how difficult it can be to want, more than anything, not to be a burden. And yet the characters are so charming and funny, and their dedication to each other so complete, that joy and affection seep through at every turn. Rose-tinting comes into play with the unfailing generosity of care worker Beata (Adrianna Pavlovska), paid for by Es\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absent son and his cold but thawing wife Catherine (Michelle McTernan); few shift-working care workers have the time to stay late for pizza or sit by a hospital bed overnight. But Beata\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warmth oozes over the story, as she and her considerate daughter Kasia (played tonight by Chioma Nduka, the role split with Ren\u00c3\u00a9e Hart) become part of Es and Flo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s found family. The ending may be overly neat, but who cares when it means the brutal loneliness of dementia can be lightened just a little? With heart and soul, Es &amp; Flo is a tender portrait of a woman caring for her love, in sickness and in health.

Kalvin Phillips has popped up on their transfer radar, bleeping frantically, as have Jo\u00c3\u00a3o Palhinha, Scott McTominay, James Ward-Prowse and Harvey Barnes. Having missed out on Phillips last summer despite making a \u00c2\u00a350m bid, West Ham have a longstanding interest in the Manchester City midfielder. He shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take much convincing to swap a club with zero European trophies this season \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a technicality, admittedly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the vanquishers of the Europa Conference League. Barnes is also a target for Newcastle, who are looking to snap up players from relegated sides in an effort to avoid the premium being levied by other clubs on account of their Saudi largesse. They are also keen on James Maddison, his Leicester teammate, and Tyler Adams, who was one of a few bright sparks in a dismal season for Leeds. Tottenham are likely to provide competition for Maddison\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature, as Ange Postecoglou wants him as part of his summer rebuild. City, meanwhile, have moved closer to signing Mateo Kovacic from Chelsea, though the two clubs are yet to agree a fee. Elsewhere, Liverpool continue to circle around Manu Kon\u00c3\u00a9 and Kh\u00c3\u00a9phren Thuram. While they have already been bolstered by the arrival of Alexis Mac Allister from Brighton for a relatively sane \u00c2\u00a335m, J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Klopp is keen to further reinforce his midfield. Kon\u00c3\u00a9, 21, has impressed for Borussia M\u00c3\u00b6nchengladbach in recent seasons, while Thuram, 22, has made his mark at Nice. It may be premature to start tracking planes, however, as no concrete bids have been submitted. As Real Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interest in Harry Kane rumbles on, reports in Spain suggest Florentino P\u00c3\u00a9rez hopes to convince Daniel Levy to part ways with his talisman for around \u00c2\u00a368m. Levy isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afraid to play hardball, though, and negotiations could be tricky. Is anyone getting a sense of deja vu? What year is this? Who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the prime minister? Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t answer that, come to think of it. Across north London, Arsenal are pursuing another potential new addition in Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Fresneda. Just relegated with Real Valladolid, the teenage right-back should come at a reasonable fee. Irritatingly for Mikel Arteta, Borussia Dortmund are also on the case and appear to be in a strong position.

The risk of mangled limbs becomes clear five minutes into the film when skater Jennifer Schauerte hits a patch of gravel, comes off her board and slams into a road barrier. The X-ray of the snapped bone in her leg is the most horrific thing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in a cinema so far this year. Three operations later, Schauerte is impatient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c maybe even reckless \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in her determination to get back on her board. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s planning a trip to the mountains of north Turkey in her camper with four friends from the skating scene. Together they are the WoolfWomen. (Disappointingly, they are not named in honour of Virginia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the extra \u00e2\u20ac\u0153o\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd seems to be a typo that stuck.) It is by no means an essential skateboarding documentary; we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learn much about the sport, its history or this group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place in skateboard culture. Instead, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more about chronicling a tribe: cool women travelling wild and free, skinny-dipping in Bulgaria, sitting around the campfire. Schauerte is the star and co-directs with Marchella De Angelis. There are glimpses of a more interesting film at points. Schauerte is clearly a big personality, with charisma and possibly the ego to match. When it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to skate in Turkey, the rest of her pack are not convinced she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovered sufficiently. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about your body, but we do,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says one, exasperatedly.

Just like the hate campaign against the movie in the US (which included the infamous #notmyariel hashtag), Chinese and South Korean social media were inundated with bad, unverified reviews and outcry over the casting of a Black Ariel. Overall, the reaction wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a surprise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Halle Bailey herself told the Face that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as a Black person, you just expect it and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really a shock any more\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Why, though? Why was the fallout from this specific film so predictable? Yes, anti-Blackness is a common feature of American public life, but the fury about a Black Ariel is about much more than disagreeable recasting of a beloved cartoon character. Audiences are possessive of cultural properties like Disney classics because they serve, in many ways, to reinforce the US national narrative: that in white worlds, all heroes are white. (And when the heroes aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t white, they exist in their own worlds, where the extent of their influence is limited to characters who look like them.) More than just fodder for nostalgia, these classic stories are part of US myth-building about itself. Making a Black woman the central figure in that myth disrupts the well-established hierarchies that have been embedded in that national narrative. That the fallout reached China and South Korea shows not only the global reach of anti-Blackness, but just how much the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own racial discourse permeates all of its cultural products, no matter where they are in the world. Disney films are uniquely American, yet Chinese audiences were unhappy because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the image of the mermaid princess in Hans Christian Andersen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairy tales has long been rooted in their hearts and it takes a leap of imagination to accept the new cast.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And for white American parents who are so committed to avoiding the work of anti-racism that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve simply opted to erase all references to Blackness from their lives altogether, having a young Black woman at the helm of a story about identity and self-discovery is simply unacceptable. Because God forbid a viewing of the film might lead to questions about Bailey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s race, or her locs or why she looks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153different\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than them. The reaction to the film is crucial to understanding both why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gotten so much hate and why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so important that it was made. Much of the white supremacist pushback against the film is tied to the rightwing war against wokeness. Ironically, though, the fact that some people can only imagine a Black girl playing Ariel as the end result of some nefarious plot to force children to see more Black people on screen is precisely why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad that this Ariel is Black. White society is clinging on to these cultural staples for dear life because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re an easy way to reinforce their ideals around what society should look like, and colorblind casting of these iconic characters is a necessary subversion of that. Even if we get nothing else out of these remakes, being racially nimble with how they are cast helps both old and young audiences reimagine what our cultural icons look like. Representation is important, but we also need to separate canon from whiteness and decolonize society\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sense of who children should look up to. As a piece of American film history, The Little Mermaid has always been subversive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its release and success single-handedly helped save the Disney corporation from collapse, and it also offered fresh commentary on topics like gender fluidity and patriarchal society. Casting a Black Ariel (though not an intentionally political move) is a continuation of that tradition, and audiences who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it have clearly been missing the point all along.

Bill Thompson, the child of Alf and Dorothy, is a snarky little sod with an attitude problem. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a part in an episode about a treasure hunt, where he says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be finished by now if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait for you slowcoaches\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which invokes in me an almost physical loathing. Even the Postman Pat fandom page describes him as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conceited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spent so much time watching Postman Pat with my baby that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve conjured up Succession-worthy backstories to explain Bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flawed personality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is it the pressure of being promised his dad Alf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s farm from an early age? This is what happens with children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television, once you become a parent and suddenly find yourself watching it. You know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re watching something created for children, but you cannot help but impose onto it an adult sensibility. For example, people often remark that Postman Pat is objectively a terrible postman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always losing the thing he is supposed to be delivering. I counter that since Royal Mail privatisation and the transformation of his role into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special delivery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he is probably on a zero-hours contract, not to mention constantly being asked to do things, such as flying a helicopter or catching a pony, that are well beyond a usual postman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s duties. My father, when visiting, pointed out that Pat being constantly tracked on an app by Ben in the office is an accurate portrayal of the kind of surveillance capitalism many workers are now forced to contend with. We may enjoy picking holes in what our children watch, but parents in Britain are immensely privileged to have such high quality children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television, especially the BBC, whose CBeebies channel and programmes are world leaders. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the few things the UK can feel proud of on the global stage at the moment. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not to say that other countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 offerings are poor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I grew up with Sesame Street (the US), and we love Bluey (Australia). TV adaptations of books such as Barbapapa (France) and the Moomins (Finland) are rightfully canonical. And of course work by people of many nationalities airs on CBeebies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of our favourites, the hilarious animated series Small Potatoes, was created by American Sesame Street writer Josh Selig and also aired on Disney in the US. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m open to the notion that I may be culturally biased in thinking that our programming is superlative. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure, however, that there are many nations in the world that have their finest stage actors delivering lines such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hello Tombliboos!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the same gravitas as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Out, out, brief candle!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Derek Jacobi), or juggling Wolf Hall with being the voice of an animated rabbit (Mark Rylance). And from a diversity perspective it feels radical: I have become quite emotional seeing how CBeebies includes children with disabilities. British children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television is internationally exported, with programmes such as Teletubbies becoming an enduring international sensation, In the Night Garden relying heavily on global sales and even Quentin Tarantino saying he loves Peppa Pig. I suppose that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thing about children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whoever you are, if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a parent, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re probably watching it. Which is one of the reasons why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprising it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a thriving critical climate: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as worthy of scrutiny as any gallery opening or work of fiction, or indeed, adult TV. One of the few writers to turn their critical attention to it was Charlie Brooker, whose Screenwipe series was a characteristically intelligent and caustic examination, but that was 15 years ago, and a one-off. Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not considered serious enough to be worthy of consideration, or there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a residual misogyny about it, as something children \u00e2\u20ac\u0153watch with mother\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Yet it shapes the identities, values, and interests of the next generation. If anything, revelations about the darker side of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television and the abusive crimes of some of its past stars show that the industry and its output should be subjected to a healthy amount of adult scrutiny as part of our wider cultural experience, rather than sequestered, dismissed or ignored. Perhaps there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an assumption that the readership isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there for regular print reviews. Personally, I would gobble up a sarcastic essay on the hideous modern incarnation of Peter Rabbit, perhaps placing Beatrix Potter in a colonial context. A piece the Guardian ran on Bluey last year was, in my opinion, a tour de force. Last year, the government pulled a \u00c2\u00a344m fund designed to support the sector, and the BBC is facing budget cuts. The societal neglect of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programming is partly behind why kids are deserting public service media in favour of YouTube and TikTok, and there is a real risk that distinctly British programmes for young viewers could vanish from screens and be replaced with imported shows. More investment in the industry so that it can foster diverse creative talent, and the big ideas to compete with the streaming platforms, is crucial. But also, I think, our cultural attitude to children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s content needs to change. At the moment, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think as a nation we truly appreciate the joy and innovation that goes into the work that is beamed into our homes every single day. I may hate Bill Thompson, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put up with him to see how that programme makes my little boy laugh with delight. As a family, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be lost without Postman Pat, and I suspect we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not alone. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working I did a bumper Ikea order recently, and after asking people for their favourite products, fellow mother and writer Alex Lloyd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommendation of their \u00c2\u00a33.50 foldable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sick bowl\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (every family needs one!) has been the clear winner, earning its keep mere days after purchase when the whole household was hit with a bug, cat included. Having still not recovered from the Mumsnet sick bowl controversy of 2019, I feel obliged to tell you that this will be its sole purpose. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not The paddling pool at Coram\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fields, or the baby pool at Parliament Hill Lido \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both closed for repairs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and apparently we are in for a scorcher here in London. The unfairness of it makes me furious. Thankfully, Islington council has come to the rescue with sprinklers in one of their parks, so at least some local kids will be able to cool off.

It is also an under-curated outfit category. Going out to eat is a much more regular occurrence, for most grownups, than going to a wedding or to a fancy party, but we spend a lot more time talking about wedding-guest outfits and party dresses than we do about what to wear to a restaurant. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because what we wear to go out isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c restaurants are expensive, and dinner out is a big treat for most of us. You are investing a substantial amount of money, and probably most of your Friday night, in this occasion. But there is no dress code, so it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel stressful, which I guess is why we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the need to plan it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly the fact that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to get dressed for dinner that makes it fun. It hits a sweet spot of being able to wear something a bit special without being forced out of your comfort zone. There are very few technical challenges, just an opportunity to look nice. Unlike planning a look for a wedding or a festival, when you are trying to allow for unknown factors like how much time you will be outside or standing up, a restaurant is a luxuriously predictable scenario. You will be sitting down; it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be madly hot or cold. No need to factor in a hood in case it rains or shoes you can stand in for hours. Also, zero pressure for this outfit to be a head-turning fashion statement. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to show that you are the life and soul of a party or down with the festival kids. You can just wear something pretty. After all, for the friend(s) or lover(s) you are dining with, tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view is you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and there is an intimate kind of theatre to that. Most of you will be hidden under the table, so choose your clothes with that in mind. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not much point wearing a jazzy sequinned skirt or the trousers that make your bum look good. Above-the-table dressing starts with a neckline to frame your face. This can be a simple crew neck but perhaps collared with a chunky necklace or given a flash of delicate drama with a long rope of beads or the arrow-sharpness of a pendant. Have fun with jewellery \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not just earrings but rings and bracelets. Your companion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hands catch your eye a lot when they eat. (Paint your nails maybe?) A soft silk blouse with a button or two undone brings a more after-dark atmosphere than a crisp cotton shirt. (A little too power breakfast.) You need to show some skin, so if your neckline is high, your sleeves should end at the elbow. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a sexiness thing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that skin reminds people you are human. A cleavage-framing deep V-neck is a little old-fashioned and can make you look a little like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone out to dinner in 1985. Looking a bit current gives the impression that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got better chat, I think. Good chat, as much as good food, being what going out to dinner is all about. Above-the-table dressing doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mean a fun top and boring trousers. I have a bunch of smartish dresses in black or jewel colours which I used to wear to work but which feel a bit over the top for our new casualised work vibe and anyway only really work with heels, which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve pretty much ditched pre-7pm. The vague sense of formality of a fitted dress, which can hit an off note in modern meetings, brings a pleasing touch of drama to the moment where you take your coat off and walk across a restaurant. (Also, since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to be sitting, I can wear one of the many pairs of fun high heels that are gathering dust on my shelves.) Most of these dresses are old favourites, which is perfect, because what you want is an outfit that feels like the best you. No matter you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worn it a thousand times. People notice if you look good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice if you are wearing the same thing as yesterday. Stepping into a dress you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worn and felt good in before can be a way of finding a thread to follow that takes you back to your best self when you feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lost touch with her a bit. Go give her a nudge. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going out for dinner, lucky thing. Model: Lynn Zhang at Body London. Hair and makeup: Carol Morley. Top: Reserved. Earrings: Boden.

Efforts to end the purchasing of oil and gas from Russia appear to have resulted in a surge in imports from other authoritarian regimes, including Algeria, Bahrain, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to data from the Office for National Statistics analysed by DeSmog. Last month the trade and business secretary, Kemi Badenoch, travelled to the Middle East to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boost trade ties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a six-country trade bloc comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Trade between the UK and the GCC hit a record high of \u00c2\u00a361.3bn in 2022. In her speech to the Conservative party conference in October 2022, the then prime minister, Liz Truss, said the UK had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153become too complacent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too dependent on authoritarian regimes for cheap goods and energy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, it appears that the UK has diverted its spending from Russia to other states accused of human rights violations and engaged in brutal conflicts. Fossil fuel imports from Russia fell from \u00c2\u00a3600m in February 2022, the month Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, to zero in January 2023. However, this was compensated for by a more than 60% annual increase in fossil fuel imports from other authoritarian petrostates. Last year the amount spent by the UK on energy imports topped \u00c2\u00a3100bn for the first time on record, with DeSmog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis indicating that the UK spent more than \u00c2\u00a3125.7bn on fossil fuel imports in the year beginning February 2022. The International Energy Agency has stated that, in order to achieve net zero, the world must achieve \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, requiring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing short of the complete transformation of the global energy system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The UK imported \u00c2\u00a36.9bn of fossil fuels from Qatar, \u00c2\u00a33.4bn from Saudi Arabia, \u00c2\u00a32.6bn from Kuwait, and \u00c2\u00a32.5bn from the UAE. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While cutting our dependence on Russian fossil fuels is both necessary and laudable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit with little actual choice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is a half-measure if only aimed at reducing fossil fuels from Russia,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dominic Kavakeb, of the human rights and environmental pressure group Global Witness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Replacing Russian energy with fossil fuels from other authoritarian regimes, some of which are also engaged in brutal conflicts, is at best shortsighted, at worst a gross hypocrisy. Fossil fuels are the currency of dictators and warmongers everywhere. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to build an energy system that benefits people and the planet, rather than polluters, petrostates and despots.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cop28 UN climate summit will be held in the UAE, a nation that has attracted criticism over its plans to expand fossil fuel operations and its appointment of Sultan Al Jaber, head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, as summit president. Al Jaber recently said that fossil fuels should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue to play a role in the foreseeable future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a statement labelled as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very dangerous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres. The average monthly value of fossil fuel imports from the UAE to the UK increased from \u00c2\u00a384.4m in the year to February 2022 to \u00c2\u00a3195m the year after. The UAE continues to arrest and imprison activists, academics and lawyers who speak out against its monarchic rulers. UAE authorities also continue to discriminate against women, LGBTQ+ communities, and migrants. Despite record high prices for oil and gas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a response to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion and loosened Covid restrictions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the volume of fossil fuels imported to the UK during 2022 remained stable, according to data from the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (Desnz). Saudi Arabia was an increasingly significant energy source for the UK, with monthly fossil fuel imports from the Kingdom quadrupling from \u00c2\u00a350.4m to \u00c2\u00a3263.8m in the year ending February 2023. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has noted the prevalence of arbitrary detention in Saudi Arabia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c calling it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a hallmark of authoritarian regimes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as reports of torture, neglect, lack of medical care and solitary confinement. Saudi Arabia also routinely executes political dissidents, having killed an average of 129 people a year since crown prince Mohammed bin Salman assumed de facto rule in 2015. Neighbouring Qatar has also profited from higher fossil fuel exports to the UK, jumping to \u00c2\u00a3531.5m a month on average in the year following Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine from an average of \u00c2\u00a3201.1m the year before. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football World Cup highlighted Qatar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor record on human rights, particularly in relation to migrant workers. A Guardian analysis in February 2021 found that over 6,500 migrants from South Asian countries had died in Qatar since it was awarded the World Cup in 2011. Despite the UK government having incrementally banned the importation of Russian fossil fuels following Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion, Russian fossil fuels are still entering the UK indirectly via imports from India, which is a major importer alongside China. Global demand for Russian oil has now surged to its highest level since the invasion. Dr David Wearing, a lecturer in international relations at Sussex University, said the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increased reliance on Gulf states for fossil fuels and investment was based \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not on an economic calculation but a strategic political calculation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Gulf states sent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a big chunk of their petrodollars into our financial system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Wearing said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those capital flows help to square off the fact that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a huge deficit on its current account [imports v exports], which becomes more important with Brexit \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the crux of the relationship.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gulf fossil fuels were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategically important in terms of power politics too\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Wearing said, in terms of keeping these countries aligned with the west rather than China. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For all these different reasons, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s [seen as] important to keep the Gulf states as they are and keep those ruling families in power \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so that the UK can trust them to continue staying aligned with the western bloc and sending their petrodollars into our economic system.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued reliance on fossil fuels is also costly for the British population. The average UK home will spend nearly \u00c2\u00a36,000 on foreign gas in the next 12 years, including \u00c2\u00a3140 on Qatari gas every year, according to a report from the Energy and Climate Change Intelligence Unit (ECIU). This cost would be reduced to \u00c2\u00a31,400 spent on foreign gas by 2030 in a typical net zero home, the ECIU said. An earlier report from the ECIU also found that, without mitigation, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dependence on imported gas was set to increase by 75% by 2035. A government spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We continue to work with international partners to maintain stability in global energy markets and boost our energy security. While we are accelerating renewables and nuclear as part of our plans to power up Britain, the transition to cleaner energy cannot happen overnight and we will continue to need oil and gas over the coming decades, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/09/experience-i-built-a-house-of-cards-50-storeys-high", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "title": "Experience: I built a house of cards 50 storeys high", "lead": "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made replicas of buildings across the world, like the Eiffel Tower and Big Ben", "author": "Tian Rui", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T09:00:02Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896773", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/de1079f2b6fc93be8b4be07b98f48dedabe8b060/309_474_7541_4524/500.jpg", "body": "I am 37 years old and live in Qingdao, China.

When it comes to stacking cards, the order to put them in, how much weight they can bear and the stability of the structure all follow rules. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like building a house. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned the rules after thousands of failures. The most important skills are coordination, patience and keeping calm. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t met anyone else who practises card architecture in China \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a niche interest. I learned the basic skills after coming across YouTube videos by the American architect and professional card stacker Bryan Berg. I bought his book, and he has become one of my heroes. I was shocked when I first saw his work; I never thought I could do something so cool. At first I practised in my bedroom. As the buildings I constructed became bigger and taller, I moved to a new house, where I also use a ladder. My new place is far from the hustle and bustle of the city, which helps me quieten my mind and focus on my work. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made replicas of buildings from all over the world, including the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul, the Eiffel Tower and the Forbidden City in China. Also Big Ben, which took 18 hours and 10,000 cards. The architectural styles of each country are different, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned a lot about these structures over the years. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also created my own designs, some based on fictional buildings, such as a castle in the movie Frozen, which took 40 hours and 12,000 cards, as well as some from video games. I prefer to be alone, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not married and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t socialise much. Perhaps because of that, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to care about other people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s views \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I can stick to my own interests and ideas, and keep going. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m content when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m building with cards in the company of my two cats every day. At first the cats were curious and often caused mischief. But the sound of falling cards scared them. Now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve settled down and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dare make any trouble. They watch me silently while I work. Currently, I cannot rely on my card stacking to make a living, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to. Maybe my passion for it will be lost if it becomes commercialised. For now, my living expenses are covered by my savings from my work as a magician. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not wealthy, but I have no problem supporting myself. I enjoy my work. Constructing buildings keeps me composed and lets me reflect on many things. Besides cards, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m learning how to shoot and edit videos on social media. Last year, I built the tallest house of cards in an hour, which took just under 42 minutes. Then I built the tallest house of cards in 12 hours. It was 3.37m tall, with 50 storeys, and took just over five hours. The former 12-hour record holder was none other than Bryan Berg, who completed a 48-storey house of cards at 3.26m tall in 2016. He built that house on a fully loaded, running washing machine. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m most satisfied when I knock a structure down. It motivates me to produce better work. My motto is: don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t settle for achieving something once \u00e2\u20ac\u201c keep seeking new challenges. In the future, I plan to build the tallest house of cards in the world. For now, I show my work online and am encouraged by my 200,000 followers on social media, who give me support. Card stacking brings me infinite joy and lets me constantly challenge myself. I also hope my creations can bring a sense of joy and surprise to more and more people. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 As told to Anna Derrig Do you have an experience to share?

Sunak and Joe Biden are very different politicians and in many ways not natural allies. But what they do have in common is an appreciation that, for both, things could be much worse, or at least notably more chaotic, in the form of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, or Donald Trump. There is also an obvious eagerness to get on, whatever the arguable lack of natural connection. As the pair began their discussions in the Oval Office on Friday, even before the reporters left, Sunak could be seen leaning forwards eagerly in his cream armchair as if towards a mentor. The pair chatted alone for 40 minutes, with UK officials saying the prime minister values the US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decades of political experience, including on areas such as China. When Sunak and Biden finally completed their discussions and made the short walk to the White House\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s East Room to face the collective mass of their two countries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 media, it was to announce an accord which, similarly, involved some fairly obvious compromises. The Atlantic declaration \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Atlantic declaration for a 21st-century US-UK economic partnership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to give the full, portentous title \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is a slightly haphazard collection of economic-based pledges and accords, some of which are already happening, while others are little more than aspirations. What it is not is the full post-Brexit trade deal to which Sunak remains officially committed, one No 10 believes Biden would most likely agree to if he had the congressional bandwidth to get it passed. But it is, nonetheless, something tangible from a trip that had, until near the end, risked feeling almost ceremonial, albeit filled with signals that Biden is happy to court his UK visitor. Sunak was clearly delighted to be put up at Blair House, the palatial presidential guest residence that had not hosted a British PM since David Cameron, complete with its longstanding in-house British chef from Warrington, who offered fish and chips on the official menu in tribute. Similarly, Sunak was feted at a Washington Nationals baseball game \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a sport he understands after living in the US, although he prefers basketball and American football \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and spent time hobnobbing with players on the pitch in a glistening white team jacket. As a crescendo to the visit, the Atlantic declaration was notable perhaps less for its content than what it perhaps indicated: the ability and willingness of two very different but similarly pragmatic leaders to compromise, bend and, as needed, simply make do. Biden is not an instinctive anglophile or a fan of Brexit, but was willing to make a fuss of a UK prime minister who, in notable contrast to his two immediate predecessors, does not exist in a haze of chaos and was able to make a deal with the EU over Northern Ireland. In policy terms, Sunak arguably gave more, the Atlantic declaration bringing the UK much more obviously into the orbit of Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost protectionist vision of trusted allies sharing technology and supply chains in the face of threats from China and Russia. This is not obvious policy for the Conservatives, hence the politely discordant note of the press conference in which Sunak said his host was not a protectionist, while at the adjoining lectern the president espoused his interventionist worldview, breezily adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to hurt any of our allies or friends.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At the core of this mutual pragmatism is a simple acceptance of facts: the world has moved on from the Brexit vote of 2016, even the 2019 UK election, when Sunak and his allies championed unfettered global free trade. First came Covid, then Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine, with worries a Chinese move against Taiwan could follow. A focus on collaboration among allies and securing supply chains suddenly makes more sense. Sunak is known to believe he has achieved a significant amount in foreign policy since becoming prime minister, while also accepting that the realities of politics means it is unlikely to boost his poll ratings. But with a general election perhaps as little as a year away, all achievements are welcome. And with the timetable closing fast, making the best of things may seem increasingly tempting."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/visual-guide-ukraine-nova-kakhovka-dam-collapse", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "A visual guide to the collapse of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nova Kakhovka dam", "lead": "Ukraine accuses Russia of blowing up Dnipro River dam, which has largely been swept away", "author": "Peter Beaumont, Harvey Symons, Paul Scruton,  Lucy Swan, Ashley Kirk and Elena Morresi", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T08:33:08Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896785", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4c811c286902d4db062c53604364e6f9548c4dd4/105_0_3146_1888/500.jpg", "body": "Where is the dam and what has happened? The dam is located upstream of the city of Kherson on the Dnipro River in southern Ukraine. Russia controls the territory on the left bank of the river. The right bank is held by Ukraine. In the early hours of 6 June, the dam collapsed. Before its collapse, the 30-metre-high, 2km-long dam had a road running along its top. It powered the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, a major energy producer, and held back a reservoir containing 18 cubic km of water that supplied communities and agriculture and provided cooling water to the nuclear power station at Zaporizhzhia, which is under Russian control. How serious is the damage and the flooding? Before-and-after satellite images show the extent of the damage to the dam and the adjacent Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which were largely swept away. The collapse sent water cascading downstream, flooding 230 sq miles of territory, according to Ukrainian authorities. This map shows the extent of the flooding as of 7 June. The geography around the river means Russian-controlled areas to the south have been more badly hit. North of Kherson city, the land rises to a plain overlooking the river. To the south is a wide delta with marshes, low-lying islands and flat, sandy levels. Video images from the city of Russian-controlled Nova Kakhovka showed flood waters in the main square rising around the municipal building on 6 June. This footage shows flooding in Korsunka, Dnipriany and Nova Kakhovka \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the three settlements immediately downstream of the dam on the Russian-controlled left bank of the river. These before-and-after satellite images show the impact of the flooding on the settlements of Krynky and Oleshky. These images show the flooding of a granary in Nova Kakhovka. What has the humanitarian impact been? At least five people have reportedly died as a result of the floods, a number that is expected to increase. Emergency services in the occupied southern portion of Kherson said on 8 June that up to 14,000 homes had been flooded. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes. Some of those who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t left have become stranded on rooftops as the water levels have risen. This drone footage shows water being delivered by air to a family trapped in their house in Oleshky. They were later rescued. Who was responsible? Ukraine has blamed Russian occupying forces, which have had control of the dam and the adjacent town since last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full-scale invasion, of blowing it up in an attempt to ward off a Ukrainian counteroffensive. The Kremlin says Kyiv sabotaged the dam to deprive Russian-controlled Crimea of the fresh water it receives from the reservoir and to distract attention from the counteroffensive. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies in the west have not directly apportioned blame to Russia, but they have questioned why Kyiv would want to destroy the dam. Engineering experts have said the collapse was most likely caused by a deliberate explosion inside the dam. It is possible that the collapse was made more impactful by the fact that Russia had deliberately allowed water levels to rise in the reservoir behind it. How will it affect Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counteroffensive? The delta area had been seen as vulnerable for Russian forces in part because of its low elevation. The flooding has put paid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for now at least \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to any potential Ukrainian attempt to cross the Dnipro River around Kherson/Nova Kakhovka by widening the barrier separating the two forces. The loss of the road across the top of the dam also deprives Ukraine of a potential line of attack across the river, leaving only the Antonivsky Bridge in Kherson city as a paved river crossing. The flooding may also allow Russian reserves in the south to block any move on Melitopol. And it could free up troop reserves concentrated in the south, allowing them to be directed elsewhere. What is the impact on farming and the environment? In the hours after the collapse, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a global ecological disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was playing out. On 8 June Zelenskiy himself said that 50,000 hectares of forest had been flooded, and that 20,000 animals and 10,000 birds were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153under threat of imminent death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This footage from upstream shows dead and dying fish on the drained bottom of the Nova Kakhovka reservoir on 7 June. There are fears that the depleted reservoir will leave three critical regions in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bread basket\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd without a key water supply. A series of canals run from the reservoir, all of which help irrigate swaths of agricultural land. The most significant of these canals are the North Crimean canal, which supplies water to western Kherson before flowing down to Crimea, and the Kakhovsky canal, which irrigates most of the Kherson region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fields before entering Zaporizhzhia. Satellite imagery of the area directly south of the reservoir taken before the dam collapse shows mile upon mile of agricultural land. Ukraine has warned that agricultural land in these regions could be so heavily affected that they could turn into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deserts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What is the impact on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant? The cooling systems for Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest nuclear plant are supplied with water from the Kakhovka reservoir. If the dam falls below 12.7m, the lowest level at which water can still be pumped upstream to Zaporizhzhia, there are alternative water sources to keep the nuclear plant cool."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/09/australia-news-live-police-ministers-gun-register-mark-dreyfus-anthony-albanese-katy-gallagher-brittany-higgins-bruce-lehrmann-peter-dutton", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Albanese urged to plead with Biden for Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "This blog is now closed.", "author": "Caitlin Cassidy (now) and Natasha May (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T08:27:45Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896788", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/07bccf7d8ec804ac9524f67c8aa51fc759675d14/0_19_7008_4205/500.jpg", "body": "With that, we will wrap the blog for the evening. Enjoy the rest of your Friday, whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hitting the town or tucking in with a good book (like myself). Here were today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major developments: Lawyers for Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson have made explosive allegations that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calculated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concerted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd media campaign using restricted court material is being waged to pressure and dissuade witnesses from giving evidence in the defamation trial brought by Bruce Lehrmann. It comes as, on Friday evening, the network issued an apology to Jacinta Nampijinpa Price following disparaging comments made by Wilkinson in leaked audio reported in the media. The Northern Territory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four land councils have declared their support of a First Nations voice in the upcoming referendum, handing the Barunga Voice Declaration to the minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has defended Katy Gallagher amid the opposition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations she misled parliament over what she knew in connection to the Brittany Higgins allegations. Greens leader Adam Bandt has decried \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disgusting political mudslinging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while independent MP Zali Steggall said the opposition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacks on Higgins were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153vile\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A UK high court judge has rejected all eight grounds of Julian Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal against his extradition order to the US on espionage charges, provoking calls from independent Andrew Wilkie for the prime minister to get on the phone with Joe Biden to push for his release. And the man who led Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health response throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, chief health officer Brett Sutton, has resigned. More than 300 million native animals are killed by cats in Australia each year as owners continue to allow their pets to roam free, AAP reports. The number of deaths represents a 34 per cent rise since the pandemic pet boom. Wildlife advocates are calling on owners to take greater responsibility for their cats to curb the losses. Almost three in four allow them to freely roam, with more than half a billion mostly native animals preyed upon each year, according to research by the Biodiversity Council, Invasive Species Council and Birdlife Australia. Darwin University Professor and ecologist Sarah Legge Charles said 323 million of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s native animals were killed by domestic cats in the past year, up from 241 million in 2020. The Biodiversity Council spokeswoman said the numbers are an alarm bell for governments to enact responsible pet ownership laws, including 24/7 cat curfews. Cats have played a leading role in most of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 34 mammal extinctions since 1788 and are central to the ongoing decline of more than 200 threatened native species. Network Ten has offered a private apology to the Nationals senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, the network has confirmed with Guardian Australia. It follows leaked audio reported in the media of the Ten host Lisa Wilkinson making disparaging comments about the Indigenous woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preselection in a private meeting with Brittany Higgins and her partner, David Sharaz, including Wilkinson struggling to pronounce the senator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name. Price posted to social media on Friday morning, calling the revelations an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153affront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Australians and demanded an apology from Wilkinson and the Channel 10 producer Angus Llewellyn, who also contributed comments in the leaked audio. The private apology, made on behalf of Paramount Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the company that owns the network - is believed to have been accepted by Price. Greens oppose changes to acts for Aukus submarines The Greens had a dissenting report on the amendments to the acts in the development of the Aukus nuclear-powered submarines, which echoed other opponents of the changes. Their report said: There are environmental, health, security and social risks associated with every facet of the nuclear industry. These risks disproportionately impact First Nations peoples and their lands. Nuclear weapons, nuclear accidents or attacks on reactors all pose unacceptable risks of catastrophic consequences for humans and the environment. There is no effective way to address nuclear disaster, therefore nuclear weapons should be eliminated and nuclear energy production should be phased out. Nuclear power is also not a safe, clean, timely, economic or practical solution to reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear submarines a step closer after barrier removed A barrier to Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for nuclear-powered submarines is poised to be removed, prompting warning of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153catastrophic consequences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after a bipartisan committee recommended legislative change. Amendments to the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act will exempt the submarines from the existing moratorium on civil nuclear power. It will allow the moratorium to continue, and for the existing regulatory bodies to oversee the start of the Aukus submarine program, before an official nuclear submarine regulatory body is set up. The foreign affairs, defence and trade committee recommended the Defence Legislation Amendment (Naval Nuclear Propulsion) bill be passed, saying in its report: The committee notes that this bill represents the first legislative step in building the legal architecture required to support Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acquisition of conventionally armed nuclear powered submarines and understands further tranches of legislation are forthcoming. Liberals accuse government of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdangerous complacency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 over foreign interference The Liberal senator James Paterson, who participated in the inquiry, accused the Labor government of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerous complacency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the foreign interference issue, and again called for public funding of the campaigns: Without these authoritative sources, the Albanese Government is creating an information vacuum that malign foreign actors will seek to exploit against Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interests, creating the perfect environment for mis- and disinformation to proliferate. The Albanese government needs to urgently correct its course to protect the integrity of the referendum. The Coalition will support measures to mitigate the risk of foreign interference in the referendum, including through the establishment and provision of formal \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign entities. Labor less concerned over foreign interference on voice Staying with the report into referendum administration, the Labor senators on the committee waved away concerns raised by the Liberal party, expressing confidence in current foreign interference safeguards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government believes that non-government organisations should lead the campaigns, and that no public funding should be allocated to either campaign,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labor senators wrote in a dissenting report. The government take threats posed by foreign interference, misinformation and disinformation to the integrity of electoral processes, including referendum processes very seriously. This was borne out by the considerable amount of evidence the Committee received from a range of government agencies about the measures that are currently in place to address these threats. Voice referendum a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchigh value target\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for foreign interference: Liberals The Liberal members wrote that while a foreign actor may not necessarily have a particular interest in the referendum passing or failing, they claimed: It is more likely that a malign foreign actor would seek to profit by exacerbating existing tensions within Australian society as a means of undermining social cohesion and national unity, and of harming Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s democratic institutions and processes in the eyes of the public. The report quoted an academic that a referendum would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153high value target for a hostile state interference campaign\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Liberal report claimed the government wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing enough to specifically prepare for foreign interference threats against the referendum, beyond what it called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153business as usual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to combat ongoing threats. The Liberal senators claimed that establishing (and funding) official campaign entities for the yes and no sides would help alleviate some concerns, by setting up official sources of information. Liberals claim voice referendum could subvert democracy Liberal senators have claimed there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a clear risk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the Indigenous voice referendum \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could be used as another vehicle to subvert Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s democracy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, raising concerns about potential foreign interference in the looming national vote. The opposition is again relitigating its previously rebuffed demands that the government provide public funding for the yes and no campaigns in the referendum, a measure the Coalition claims would help avert some risk of misinformation and disinformation in the campaign. But government members of a Senate committee, which reported back this afternoon, have again rejected that concern and said Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current foreign interference measures are adequate. The Senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance committee held an inquiry into administration of the referendum. Previous public hearings featured the electoral commission and integrity experts. The committee reported back today, with the majority report (written by Liberal members of the committee) raising foreign interference concerns. Wilkie \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot surprised\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 about leaked text messages on Higgins Turning to the story of the day on text messages leaked in Newscorp papers about Brittany Higgins, Wilkie says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not surprised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there might have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people talking to people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before allegations were made public. On revelations Senator Katy Gallagher may have had knowledge prior to the allegations being released, he says: The aspect of this that troubles me is whether or not a government senator may have misled the parliament. Now, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possibly know whether Senator Gallagher did or did not mislead the parliament, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the allegation that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out there, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very serious allegation. I would hope, with parliament sitting in the next couple of weeks, that that can be explored in the parliament, and we can find the truth of the matter. He says a personal explanation would bring \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some comfort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to people concerned. Otherwise this will just drag on, like so many political sagas do. Just drag on for day after day, week after week, causing enormous grief for everyone. I think this should be dealt with quick smart. Wilkie has support in the Greens camp: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcUS president can intervene at any time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Wilkie Wilkie says his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reading of the tea leaves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is both the Australian, British and US governments are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all over\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the drawn out process with Assange. I think all three governments want to see an end to this, but a sense, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just offering my personal opinion now \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that there is in Washington a sense that the justice process must be allowed to run its course, but of course the US president can intervene at any time and let that justice process be halted, that is what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hoping we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still occur at this 11th hour. MP has urged Anthony Albanese to pick up the phone and make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal plea\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the US president for Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release. I applaud Anthony Albanese and also Peter Dutton \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they have both now very clearly stated publicly that they think this matter has gone on long enough and it should be brought to an end, but regrettably, such statements have not resolved the matter. With possibly only weeks to go before the extradition might occur, you know, frankly I would like to see Anthony Albanese speak to US president Joe Biden on the telephone, and make a personal plea from one ally to another, and we do have a special relationship, we do have more influence in Washington than some people might realise. Wilkie said Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s imprisonment was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible injustice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a man who had helped reveal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard evidence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of US war crimes. I will take this opportunity again to reach out to the Australian prime minister and plead with him, please do more, do whatever you can, please pick up the phone. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcVery disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: MP Andrew Wilkie on Julian Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed appeal Meanwhile, the Tasmanian independent MP Andrew Wilkie has been appearing on ABC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Afternoon Briefing amid renewed calls for the federal government to ramp up its diplomatic efforts to free the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. Wilkie, the co-convener of the Bring Julian Assange Home parliamentary group, said the news overnight that Assange had failed in his application to appeal against his imprisonment was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His legal team has indicated they will urgently make one more application, but we are just about out of time here. The reality is that if that last appeal is unsuccessful next week, then Julian could be on a plane to the United States in as little as a few weeks \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 there he will go and face court for 17 espionage charges, and other charge related to use of computers, and if he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convicted in the US, he faces a maximum imprisonment of 175 years. Wilkie said the next application in a British court was likely to be the last. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMajor step forward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: packaging reforms gather support Peak bodies have come out in support of the reforms to packaging announced by the environment minister this afternoon. The Australian Council of Recycling (ACOR) applauded environment ministers for their decision to regulate packaging design, with the aim of achieving targets for reuse, recyclability, and recycled content. CEO Suzanne Toumbourou: A stronger regulatory framework, which promotes circular design and ensures robust end markets for recycled materials, is essential for a sustainable recycling system. The World Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature Australia said the new rules would have a significant on the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plastic pollution crisis. Kate Noble, WWF Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo Plastics in Nature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 policy manager, said it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major step forward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the war on waste and move to a circular economy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a commitment that will be welcomed by Australians who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been so disappointed by the collapse of our soft plastic recycling scheme. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heartening to see governments coming together to finally take action on this issue and listen to Australians who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made it very clear they want companies to take responsibility for the packaging and waste they produce. Meanwhile, in the NT: Three men charged over Melbourne burglaries Three Irish nationals have been charged over a string of burglaries worth more than $25,000 in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Police allege the three men, who entered Australia in the past three months, used sophisticated measures to unsuccessfully hide their tracks in six separate burglaries. Methods included splashing cleaning fluid on the floors and furniture at targeted properties, police allege. More than $25,000 of property was allegedly stolen including large amounts of cash, jewellery, and designer handbags. On Thursday, detectives arrested the three men, all with no fixed address, at a car park in Box Hill. They were charged with aggravated burglary, six counts of burglary, theft, handle stolen goods and dealing with property suspected of being proceeds of crime. One of the men arrested is a 29-year-old Blackburn man, who is wanted by police in the UK for his alleged involvement in a series of burglaries across England. Victoria Police have referred the matter to UK police and relevant immigration authorities. One of the men arrested is a 29-year-old Blackburn man, who is wanted by police in the UK for his alleged involvement in a series of burglaries across England. Victoria police have referred the matter to UK police and relevant immigration authorities. The men will appear at Ringwood magistrates court on 3 July. Government to regulate textile industry, waste collection At today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting of environment ministers it was also agreed regulation on the textile and clothing sector would be introduced by mid-next year if the sector didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take responsibility for waste, and that a national roadmap would be established for consistent kerbside collection rules. Ministers also agreed to support \u00e2\u20ac\u0153priority renewables and critical minerals projects\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd protecting the environment with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153faster, clearer decisions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and to take action on threatened and invasive species. Packaging to be subject to strict new rules The federal minister for the environment, Tanya Plibersek, has announced packaging will soon be subject to strict new government rules aimed at cutting waste and placing greater responsibility on packaging companies. The agreement was struck today at a nation meeting with respective environment ministers. Under the changes, mandatory packaging design standards and targets will be introduced, including for recycled products, to address harmful chemicals used in food packaging. Plibersek noted more than 70% of the environmental impacts of an item are locked in at the design stage, before products are bought, used or disposed of. Plibersek: We need to dramatically reduce packaging waste, and the harmful chemicals that destroy our environment. We see packaging in the guts of dead birds, floating in our oceans, destroying nature as it takes generations to degrade. Until now, governments have ignored calls to step in and set mandatory targets. While some in the industry have stepped up to voluntarily reduce their impact, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just not enough. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re changing that. Sydney police officer charged after domestic violence inquiry A south Sydney police officer has been charged after a domestic violence investigation by the professional standards command. Earlier this month, officers commenced an investigation into an alleged domestic violence incident involving the serving police officer, who is attached to a specialist command, while he was off duty. Following inquiries, the 48-year-old male senior constable was arrested today and taken to Sutherland police station, charged with assault occasioning bodily harm and common assault. He was granted bail and will appear before Sutherland local court on 14 June. Police say his employment status is under review. Sutton \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot leaving yet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a few months with transition work and lots of thanks from me and my team. He says his garden has gone \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit crazy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and hopes he will be able to get it back on track before starting the new role at the CSIRO. Sutton says while he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not standing up at press conferences every day, as he did in 2020 and 2021, he says Covid-19 is still out there and people should continue to protect themselves: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still of the view that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of benefit in informing people to protect themselves ... 50, 60 people die every week, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we can prevent all those deaths from occurring but I know we can pick up those booster vaccines, continue to test, and prescribe antivirals as required. Sutton memoirs unlikely If you were really excited for the release of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Brett Sutton: The Man Behind The Mask\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to drop in time for Christmas 2023 you may need to steady your expectations. Reporter: Will you write a tell all one day? Sutton: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think so, the last three and a half years were a bit too much of a blur to recall it all. Asked what BS annoyed him the most, Sutton says the list is too big. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt nearly crushed me\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Sutton on Covid Asked how he handled the pressure during Covid, Sutton replies: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a relief to be away from that. I accept that in a crisis that has to sit on your shoulders, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escaping that. I was in the midst of that beast for a long time. Victoria carried the heavy load in that regard. On the one hand, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helped me to grow personally and professionally, on the other hand it nearly crushed me and it certainly weighed upon my family life and I hope they never have to carry that again \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what a rock for me to have the family I do have and an enormous thanks to them for carrying me through those times. Asked what nearly crushed him, he says it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cumulative effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of everything during the pandemic: It was the 16-hour days, sprinting for six months without a day off, throw in the vitriol and the death threats and the intrusions and the kind of bargae of lies that you see, especially on social media \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 accountability is appropriate \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but the BS that is sometimes spouted out there is quite extraordinary sometimes. If you, like me, were in Victoria during the time of our lockdowns, it is vaguely alarming to see Sutton on the television again (nothing personal, of course). But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off to greener pastures! Victoria \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdid pretty well\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 framing Covid as airborne, Brett Sutton says Brett Sutton is holding a press conference in Melbourne after announcing this morning he will be stepping down as Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief health officer. Asked if he has any regrets, he says: There shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a person in the world who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been part of the public health response who wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect on things they would do differently .. I am absolutely no different in that regard \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 would I do things differently with the knowledge I have of the virus now? . \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 absolutely I would, but my intent was always protecting the health and wellbeing of Victorians. He says Victoria \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did pretty well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in acknowledging Covid was an airborne virus early but could have acted even faster: The lessons on ventilation, opening doors and windows \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 hepa filters that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve installed in schools \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6I wish the world had come to that earlier. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad Victoria came to it when it did, wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it have been great if we had it \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 from the get go. Many thanks Natasha May for keeping us informed this week. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be with you for the rest of this fine Friday afternoon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and what better way to spend it than quenched with the latest news. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s me signing off for the week. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the wonderful hands of Caitlin Cassidy! Northern Land Council stands strong with Barunga Voice Declaration The Northern Land Council chair, Samuel Bush-Blanasi, said the Aboriginal people of the NT were standing strong together in the Barunga Voice Declaration. He said: We speak for our clans, communities and our families, asking all Australians to support us and vote yes so we can finally be respected as equals. The declaration comes 35 years after the original 1988 Barunga Statement, which called for the recognition of Aboriginal rights and culture and was presented to the former prime minister Bob Hawke by the then NLC chair Yunupingu and CLC chair Wenten Rubuntja. The land council members are the elected representatives of tens of thousands of residents of remote communities, town camps and towns across the Territory. The Central Land Council chair, Matthew Palmer, said most Aboriginal people across the country support a First Nations voice. He said: Please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let the naysayers in Canberra confuse you. Support us by voting yes. The Northern Territory\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four land councils have declared their support of a First Nations voice in the upcoming referendum. The Barunga Voice Declaration has been handed to the minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, at the Barunga festival being held this weekend. The declaration calls: For the recognition of our peoples in our still young constitution by enshrining our voice to the parliament and executive government, never to be rendered silent with the stroke of a pen again. With AAP One in 10 Covid-19 fines in Victoria paid The state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, has told the public accounts and estimates committee budget estimates hearing that 50,150 Covid-19 fines have been issued, totalling more than $100m but only 5,500 have been paid in full. About 3,500 are part of ongoing payment plans and 14,319 remain unpaid past their due date. Some 3,700 people have taken their fines to court and 11,800 fines have been cancelled by enforcement agencies. Adam Bandt has commented on contention over whether Labor figures were aware of Brittany Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaint before she went public. He said: The disgusting political mudslinging over Brittany Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 brave decision to speak out sends the wrong message to every woman \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Women should be able to come forward without worrying that their text messages will be splashed across the media. Nothing we have seen so far suggests the need for an inquiry or referral to the NACC. Warnings have been issued for the Sevens Creeks, downstream of Euroa to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prepare now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for moderate flooding at Kialla West on Saturday morning. Vic Emergency says: Since 9am Thursday, rainfall totals of up to 20mm have been observed across the Seven and Castle Creeks catchment. No significant rainfall is forecast for the remainder of Friday and into the weekend. River levels will remain elevated for the next few days. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The flood peak is approaching Kialla West where river levels are likely to exceed the minor flood level overnight Friday into Saturday. A moderate flood peak at Kialla may occur during Saturday morning. NSW police seeking to arrest property developer Jean Nassif Detectives want to hear from anyone who might know where controversial Sydney developer Jean Nassif is after warrants were granted for his arrest in relation to an alleged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153large-scale fraud\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Organised crime squad detective Superintendent Peter Faux on Friday said NSW police did not know where Nassif was but did not believe he had been in Australia for some months. Faux said: Yesterday we applied for arrest warrants in relation to Mr Jean Nassif and those arrest warrants have been granted and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here today in relation to seeking assistance in relation to the whereabouts of Mr Nassif or if he wants to come forward and speak to detectives. He said offices were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsure in relation to his exact whereabouts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but would have conversations with any foreign government or international police force if they knew where he was. Albanese is insisting the government is keeping the stage-three tax cuts in their current form despite Clennell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scepticism. Clennell: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve committed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to keep stage three tax cuts in their current form. Sometimes it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like your heart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really in it. (That also get a laugh from the audience.) Albanese: I said very clearly, at the time we tried to amend those tax cuts. We tried \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Clennell: Now you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in government. Albanese: We are. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve noticed. (More laughs from the audience) Clennell: So why does it matter what you did in opposition? Albanese: And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve noticed too. So we legislated - Clennell: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a theory you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take it to the next election altering it. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not going to happen? Albanese: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said that we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed our position. Albanese: the cheapest form of new energy is renewables On energy, the PM is expressing his frustration at the previous government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decade of inaction. Albanese: How is it that Snowy 2.0 is not connected to the grid? What is the point of doing a massive project like that, that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plugged in? I mean it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absurd and we are having to deal with a decade of inaction where you had $4m for a new coal-fired power station study to the proponents at Collinsville in Queensland. No one thought that was going to go ahead. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing to stop someone going out there and investing in a new coal fired power plant except reality, except the market \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the market tells you the cheapest form of new energy is renewables. Albanese: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwe need increased density along transport corridors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 When the conversation moves to the housing crisis, the PM continues to express his frustration with the Greens who the government is yet to reach an agreement with to gain support for their housing future fund. Albanese accuses the minor party of hypocrisy on this issue: Now you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t address housing issues like overnight. It takes time, but the big issue we all know is supply. And some of the hypocrisy it must be said of the Greens political party is that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen a medium-density development, let alone a high-density development that they wanted to support. And we need to address those issues. We need increased density along transport corridors. They are things that we need reform on. Albanese went on to describe the approvals he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d made in his own electorate: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclet it rip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bad developments in inappropriate locations, but you can have increased density particularly along transport corridors, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on the record of doing so in my own electorate consistently. Albanese corrects Laura Jaye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s halfway through his first term, the PM says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only one year in. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not contemplating an early election. PM begins live panel discussion on Sky News The live panel discussion portion of the event is now kicking off, with PM interviewed by Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 political editor, Andrew Clennell. Clennell begins: So you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had 11 interest rate hikes since you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve become PM. Albanese: Good start Andrew. (That gets a laugh from the audience.) The PM goes on: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very positive and optimistic about the future. You forgot that there was one beforehand. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Interest rates were never going to stay at 0.1%. That was never going to happen. He acknowledges the rate rises are placing financial pressure on Australians, especially mortgage holders, but maintains he is optimistic. PM: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI feel great confidence in our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Albanese continues on an optimistic note, pointing to the opportunities posed by renewable energy, technology and growing the care economy. He ends on Labor values. The how matters, enduring economic reform depends on bringing people along in the journey \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what counts is returning the productivity gains to the employers, but also the workers \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to improve living standards \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 fairer wages, and a better quality of life. This is how we create a growing productive economy that works for people, not the other way round \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I feel great confidence in our nation. PM calls for regulations to be updated ahead of AI advances Albanese says the government needs to focus on safety to improve cyber security, making sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guidance and support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help businesses navigate privacy concerns and growing risks over AI. There is huge potential here for productivity gains \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 for transformative advances \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but of course there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an element of risk as well. He says rules and frameworks need to be updated in light of the rapidly moving artificial intelligence sector. Albanese calls for businesses to strategically adopt new technologies and for government to guard against risks Albanese says we should always be mindful of efficiencies but in the decade ahead, bigger thinking is needed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly in technology and innovation. The economic change under way is far bigger than this. The way we share technology will be absolutely critical \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we need to think about ways technology can empower workers, freeing people up from the routine parts of their job \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and giving them back that time to focus on producing and caring and innovating. He says productivity gains can be achieved if businesses adopt new technologies \u00e2\u20ac\u0153earlier, more widely \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and strategically\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, calling for leadership from the sector while also pointing to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role. Government has a key role to play in maximising the potential benefits and guarding against risks. Prime minister says Australia is well-placed to meet global economic challenges Albanese points to the global economic outlook, which is projecting tight financial conditions. Australia is not immune to any of these challenges but we are extremely well placed. He points to Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investment in clean energy as a buffer which will create new export markets and ensure the nation can not only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sustain but grow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd large-scale energy projects while cutting emissions. In order to ensure this growth is sustained and shared over the long term, Australia needs to lift our game on productivity \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 our economic task is not just to clear away the waste and strengthen the budget, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to modernise the economy. This is where, as a country, we need a smarter and more strategic approach to productivity instead of the self-defeating model that says workers should be expected to do more with less. PM: Labor is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcworking with business, not holding it back\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Albanese says in many fields, business has been ahead of government and now Labor is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153working with business, not holding it back\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says the government is looking to work with states and territories, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not pick fights with them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. All of us have an interest in building a stronger economy. Albanese: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcif we drag our feet or turn our backs, the future will shape us\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Albanese says there is a moment in Australia the nation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot afford to miss\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and says for the first time \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in a long time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the economy is breaking new ground. He says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proud during his first term in office there have been record levels of workforce participation, including a record number of women in full-time work. We are not in government to simply occupy the space. Our purpose and our focus is to support people while building Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term prosperity. We approach this task with optimism and urgency \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 driven by the understanding if we drag our feet or turn our backs, the future will shape us. Albanese on budget: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcphrase we used most was getting the balance right\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Albanese says in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the discussions my colleagues and I had when putting together the budget, the phrase we used most was getting the balance right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Getting pressure off families without putting it on inflation, providing meaningful help for those doing it tough while ensuring made responsible choices \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and be able to forecast first surplus in 15 years. He points to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big overarching ever-present balance you have to get right in government \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dealing with the pressing challenges of the here and now while never losing sight of the future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Albanese lists off the immediate term support in the budget, a cost of living package, tripling medicare bulk billing incentive, cutting medicine costs, energy bill relief, modest increases to jobseeker and rent assistance and, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153close to my heart\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a parenting single payment increase as well as investment in childcare. No applause for constitutional recognition As is custom, Albanese begins by acknowledging Traditional Owners and says he is proud to lead a government that will vote for constitutional recognition in the last quarter of this year. No applause. Meanwhile the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is about to step up to deliver a keynote address at a business luncheon at Crown Sydney, hosted by Sky News and the Australian. The address will be followed by a live panel discussion with Sky News political editor Andrew Clennell. ABS figures show mining sector drops 10.6% over April Mining experienced the biggest turnover fall of any sector this April, figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today have found. The figures found nine of 13 selected industries experienced a turnover drop, with mining recording the largest percentage decrease of 10.6%. Kate Lamb, the ABS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of business indicators, said the industry-wide drop hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been recorded since July 2021 during the Delta wave of the pandemic. The mining industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fall was led by coal and iron ore miners, as prices for these commodities fell and exports were lower. Electricity, gas, water and waste services recorded the second largest monthly fall in turnover (-9.4%), reversing the 9.3% rise in March. This was followed by transport, postal and warehousing (-6.8%), shipping and freight businesses and airline operators. Accommodation and food services recorded small rises, followed by retail trade. PM pays tribute to footballer Rale Rasic Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football community continues to mourn the death of pioneer Rale Rasic, who has died, aged 87. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has also paid tribute to the man who became the first coach to take the Socceroos to a World Cup. Female firefighters diagnosed with cervical, ovarian and uterine cancers will be covered under a long-awaited expansion of Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presumptive rights scheme, AAP reports. Legislation for the scheme will be amended to include primary site cervical, ovarian and uterine cancers, the emergency services minister, Jaclyn Symes, announced today. Firefighters who havee served for 10 years and are diagnosed on or after June 1 2016 will qualify for presumptive compensation linked to those cancers, in line with other already included forms of the disease. Presumptive rights mean that career and volunteer firefighters diagnosed with certain cancers do not need to prove firefighting caused their disease. Victorian firefighters are currently covered for 12 specified cancers but must have served five to 25 years to qualify, depending on their cancer type. The 12 cancers are primary site brain, bladder, kidney, breast, testicular, prostate, ureter, colorectal, oesophageal, non-Hodgkins lymphoma and leukaemia cancers, as well as multiple myeloma. Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nurses and midwives union thanks Brett Sutton Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s union representing nurses and midwives have issued a statement thanking chief health officer, Brett Sutton, who announced this morning he will be leaving the health department. The Victorian Branch of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lisa Fitzpatrick said: Prof Sutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public health decisions through the pandemic years, while not always popular, were always designed to protect the lives of all Victorians. He also acknowledged and had a deep understanding of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHerculean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 challenges nurses and midwives faced and embraced head on. Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nurses, midwives and personal care workers say thank you for steering Victoria through the most tumultuous of times and protecting our precious health system. Thankfully few of us will ever know the weight of the responsibility Victoria placed on his shoulders. Police officer dragged by car was new to the force WA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s police minister, Paul Papalia, said the injured constable was relatively new to the force. He told reporters: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very, very worrying situation at the moment. This is something that every single police officer will feel ... in particular, those officers that were at the scene and responded and resuscitated their colleague. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredibly hard, challenging incident and I feel for them all. Police commissioner Col Blanch commended the constable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partner and other officers who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did everything they could\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to provide first aid and get him to hospital as quickly as possible. Blanch said: He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a long road ahead of him, but this is a time when the blue family does come together and we support all of our officers. This is not how we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re supposed to end our shift. A man has been charged after a police officer was allegedly run over and dragged beneath a car during an arrest, leaving him fighting for his life. Officers were following the car, allegedly bearing stolen number plates, through Ascot in Perth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s east about 1am on Thursday when it came to a stop. Police say as they tried to detain the three occupants, a 28-year-old constable was hit by the vehicle and dragged underneath. His fellow officers had to lift the car off him and attempted CPR at the scene before he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma and remains in intensive care in Royal Perth hospital with his family by his side. West Australian police on Friday said a 23-year-old Belmont man had been charged with multiple offences, including committing an act intended to prevent arrest which caused grievous bodily harm. He was also charged with stealing a motor vehicle, reckless driving to escape police pursuit, failing to stop when directed and possession of methamphetamine and a drug implement. He was refused bail and is due to face Perth magistrates court today. A 20-year-old woman and 25-year-old man who were also allegedly in the stolen car have been released pending further investigation. - AAP Flooding watch and act issued along Victorian-NSW border Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergency agency says there is near major flooding occurring near the NSW border at Docker Road Bridge. They are warning that moderate flooding is also possible along the Ovens River at Wangaratta this evening. Bruce Lehrmann will not be asked over supposed public campaign to pressure witnesses Collins said Lehrmann had signalled publicly that he intended to run a public campaign against Higgins and the respondents in the media. He said the publicity was such that it was having the effect of putting pressure on witnesses who would be giving evidence in the defamation trial. This is a trial coming before Your Honour in a few short months. The publicity of the last few days can only have been calculated to put pressure on witnesses not to give evidence. Justice Michael Lee suggested that such matters were better heard by the ACT supreme court, through contempt of court proceedings. The parties want the federal court to interrogate Lehrmann to ascertain whether he was responsible. Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers rejected the grave allegation. They say Lehrmann denied involvement and said the allegations from the media were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aggravating damages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the defamation case. They have no idea, they are fishing around in the dark. Lee rejected the attempt to have Lehrmann interrogated about the issue. Chrysanthou signalled a further application would be made on the issue. Lawyers for Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson have made explosive allegations that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calculated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concerted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd media campaign using restricted court material is being waged to pressure and dissuade witnesses from giving evidence in the defamation trial brought by Bruce Lehrmann. Sue Chrysanthou SC, counsel for Wilkinson, and Dr Matt Collins KC, counsel for Network Ten, on Friday complained of a significant amount of publicity in Channel Seven and News Corp in recent days. They said the coverage relied on material that had been produced under compulsory orders during Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criminal trial but was never tendered, which would be against rules governing the sharing of such material. The subject material included a copy of Brittany Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 phone and a recording of the five-hour pre-interview meeting between Higgins, David Sharaz, Wilkinson, and producer Angus Llewellyn. Chrysanthou said the publicity had put improper pressure on Wilkinson. She said that someone is engaged in a concerted campaign and accused the media of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dishonestly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd editing the five-hour tape. [The] publicity has been to such an extent that it tends to and has had the effect of \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 putting improper pressure on my client, overwhelmingly so. Now these media organisations are, it would appear, wholly publishing one side of the story. She described the Spotlight program as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a deliberate attack on my client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professionalism as a journalist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There was no attempt to approach my client prior to broadcast to ask her questions about what was happening in that recording. Max Chandler-Mather, Greens spokesperson for housing and homelessness, said the loss of revenue from higher rates comes on top of the $12.4bn that negative gearing and capital gains will cost the budget next year. The government needs to explain how they can justify spending an extra half a billion a year on tax breaks for investors when they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a single dollar of guaranteed funding for public housing or to freeze rents Separately, productivity growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or rather the lack of it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has been become the latest flash point about whether we can afford higher wages without forcing the RBA to keep lifting its cash rate. We took a look at what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on, and whether the tizz is warranted in this explainer: Latest RBA rate rise to lop $546m from the federal budget, PBO says This week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision by the Reserve Bank to lift the official interest rate to 4.1% not only depressed borrowers but it also dented the federal budget, which had based its calculations on a peak rate of 3.85%. Judging by market expectations, Treasury better be reassessing their numbers because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably at least another 25 basis-point increase to come. The Greens asked the Parliamentary Budget Office to distil the impact on the budget of the latest increase, and were told it would be $546m (rising to $1.09bn if the RBA hiked again). In its response, the PBO said the estimates were based \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a revenue-forgone basis, which means they do not incorporate behavioural responses to changes in the cash rate, nor any broader economic impacts such as changes to house prices or rents\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. (It looks like the tally excludes the fact some people will pay more tax because their deposits will provide a larger return.) The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has defended Katy Gallagher amidst the opposition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegations she misled parliament over what she knew in connection to the Higgins allegations. Appearing on Sunrise on David Koch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last day in the job, Albanese answered the question of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did your colleague mislead Parliament?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with a firm \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Take a step back, Kochie, what is being suggested here by Peter Dutton? You had allegations by a Liberal staffer that another Liberal staffer had a sexual assault in a liberal ministers office and, somehow, Katy Gallagher has some responsibility for what was going on here? This is bizarre. You had a circumstance also where Scott Morrison had an enquiry by Phil Gaetjens, his former chief of staff who was the head of department and prime minister and cabinet, and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 who knew what in his own office, we still have never, ever seen that report. I mean, for Peter Dutton to talk about transparency, frankly, is quite farcical here. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The idea that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this conspiracy somehow ... that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nonsense. Budget grilling back on in Victoria Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public accounts and estimates committee continues to grill ministers on the latest budget. Fronting up this morning is the health minister, Mary-Anne Thomas. She confirmed former Andrews government ministers Martin Foley and Lisa Neville have been appointed as the board chairs of Alfred Health and Barwon Health, respectively. The long-serving MPs both resigned in July last year. It prompted an outburst from Liberal MP, Nick McGowan, who said: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to be kidding. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPlease don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the people and the work that we have all still got to do\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, says Clare Sussan Ley accused Gallagher of not answering questions around the issue. But the education minister, Jason Clare, appearing alongside Ley on the program, has come to Gallagher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence and made a plea not to miss the bigger picture: What Sussan just said is wrong, suggesting that Kate is not answering these questions. She was on ABC Radio answering these questions yesterday. She is a person of the utmost integrity. You both know Katie and you would know that she is a person of integrity and if the Liberal party want to refer this to the anticorruption commission then fill your boots. Remember what this is about. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an allegation that a person was raped in Parliament House 50 metres from the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. That led to an inquiry that Kate Jenkins did that exposed the fact that 40% of women in the building have been sexually harassed. I know we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re getting wound around the axle here of the politics of all of this, but please don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget the people and the work that we have all still got to do that is not finished yet, about making sure it is a safe place to work. Ley weighs in on Gallagher and Higgins Back on the opposition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concerns Katy Gallagher misled parliament if she knew of Brittany Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 allegation before it was made public later. Gallagher has vehemently denied this. Sussan Ley has weighed in, saying it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153morally bankrupt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if any politician or journalist sought to politically profit from a rape allegation. She told the Morning Show: These are serious and concerning issues. If any politician or journalist sought to politically profit from a rape allegation then that is just morally bankrupt. There are serious questions here, questions of character for Anthony Albanese and his leadership. Katy Gallagher is the finance minister, the minister for women, the senior member of the government and part of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership team and she is not answering basic questions. Uber has revealed plans to launch a service dedicated to zero and low-emission vehicles, AAP reports. The ride sharing giant will introduce its Uber Green tier in Australia today. Uber Green will appear as an option in the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online app, will let users request a ride in an electric or hybrid vehicle for the same price as an UberX ride. It will be available in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Perth, Adelaide and Canberra at launch, with towns in Tasmania and the Northern Territory yet to qualify. The launch, announced at the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Go-Get Zero event in London, comes four years after Uber Green was introduced in Europe and more than 1,250 electric vehicles were registered with the platform in Australia. Uber will also offer electric vehicle charging discounts to its Australian drivers in partnership with BP. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi also announced a suite of green initiatives on Friday, including upcoming features to advise drivers when and where to charge their electric cars, to help the company reach its net-zero emissions target by 2040. Uber Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director, Dom Taylor, said the new initiative would encourage more drivers to adopt the technology and more riders to try it. Marles asked about revoking Afghanistan medals Circling back to Marles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 interview on the Today Show, the defence minister was asked about removing medals from soldiers in Afghanistan. Ultimately I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a decision maker in this and I have to be careful here. The chief of the defence force has gone through a process of command accountability and his recommendations are on my desk and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking appropriate advice. Marles affirmed the Albanese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Brereton report \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to the fullest possible extent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually very important for our defence force, it is very important for our nation, and frankly I think to do anything different to that would be to be judged by history. So, we will implement the recommendations of the report to the fullest possible extent, and in terms of the specific processes in relation to specific medals, we will go through the appropriate process. Ruston wants to know \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwho knew what, when\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 In her ABC Radio interview, Anne Ruston also called for greater clarity on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who knew what, when\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Higgins case. RN Breakfast host Hamish McDonald challenged Ruston: Respectfully, those those sorts of claims are not new. Is there anything that has emerged this week in your mind, which means that Senator Gallagher actually has to explain anything? Ruston: I think Senator Gallagher and the prime minister just need to come forward and say, who knew what and when. And I think that that would put the matter to bed. But if they are aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to come up with satisfactory answers around the questions about the political roles that were played or not played by anybody, and that includes the processes around the compensation, then I think Australians are right to be asking questions. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, was yesterday very clear about the compensation, which he approved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Gallagher, as the minister for finance, had no role in. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run a running commentary on the cases,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 says Hume Opposition finance spokeswoman Jane Hume, appearing alongside Marles on the program, said she believed clarification was still needed: There is inconsistencies between the reports that we are getting from those text messages and what we are hearing from Labor ministers, and what happened when. And I think unfolding that, unpacking that, making sure there is some clarification is really important here. Because misleading parliament, misleading the Senate is a big deal, particularly when you rely on the honesty and integrity of ministers and senators, and so there are some questions to be answered here. However, Hume said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run a running commentary on the cases going on, because there are processes still under way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pointing to the fact the Sofronoff inquiry hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reported yet. Katy Gallagher did not mislead parliament, Marles says The deputy prime minister Richard Marles also denied Senator Katy Gallagher misled parliament on the issue of her involvement with Higgins alleged assault. Marles told the Today Show: Katy has made her position very clear earlier in the week, and she has made clear that she is very comfortable with the statements that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of the matter in terms of Katy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s position. Katy is a person of enormous integrity. It is one of my great honours to work alongside her in this government. She does a great job as the finance minister. She does a great job for this government and doing a great job for the Australian people. Zali Steggall told Nine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today program this morning: This is a pretty vile attack from Dutton and Linda Reynolds, putting at risk the mental health of someone that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very vulnerable. We have to remember that Brittany Higgins is a very vulnerable young woman and making her the punching bag of a political attack is really unsavoury. Steggall called for the content of emails and phone calls made by Reynolds after she was made aware of the alleged assault to be made public. In my experience, Katy Gallagher has been a very ethical person in all my dealings with her. This is quite a distraction from the Liberal party, and it says a lot for Dutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moral compass. - AAP A federal MP has leapt to the defence of Brittany Higgins after a political brawl erupted over a settlement she received following her alleged sexual assault inside Parliament House. Independent Zali Steggall accused the Coalition leadership of turning her into a political punching bag to further their attacks on the Labor government. Higgins, a former Liberal staffer, reached a settlement with the commonwealth in December 2022 after she launched legal action against her employers in the previous Coalition government. Higgins alleged she was raped by Bruce Lehrmann in 2019 inside the office of the Coalition minister Linda Reynolds, who they both worked for. Lehrmann has always denied Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 allegation. Reported text messages between Higgins and her partner David Sharaz suggest the pair discussed potentially strategising with finance minister Katy Gallagher, when she was in opposition, after the rape allegation was made public. Reynolds has threatened to refer the compensation payment to the national anti-corruption commission, which starts work on 1 July. Her leader, Peter Dutton, on Thursday said the government had questions to answer and backed calls for the matter to be referred to the integrity commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c AAP \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTake the tax and levy off the table\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for aged care taskforce, Coalition says Anne Ruston, the shadow minister for health and aged care, is calling for the government to take the idea of a levy to pay for aged care off the table. The idea of a Medicare-style levy to pay for the entire system was proposed by one commissioner at the aged care royal commission while another commissioner proposed a mix of a levy and higher financial contributions from users. The Albanese government this week announced it would be setting up a taskforce to settle the question of how to pay for higher standards of care. Ruston says: I just think putting a tax or a levy on the table upfront does not provide the incentive to the taskforce that the government is expecting them to come up with something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more innovative and more reformist, and something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be sustainable into the longer term. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say take the tax and levy off the table and let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look at something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little bit more brave and reformist than that. Ruston says the opposition is prepared to work constructively with the government on finding the best solution. The man who led Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health response throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, chief health officer Brett Sutton, has resigned. Sutton will step down from his role after four years to move to a new position. He will take up a new role as director of health and biosecurity at CSIRO, Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national science agency. Victorian Department of Health secretary Euan Wallace hailed Sutton as an invaluable leader and thanked him for his work during the public health crisis. Since joining the Department in 2011, Professor Sutton has helped to develop a strong and responsive public health team, providing critical health information and advice on a wide variety of issues and emergencies over the years. He was appointed chief health officer in 2019 and led Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health response throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, playing a key role in keeping the community safe and informed. - AAP Woman, 39, and girl, 11, stabbed in Queensland A teenager is in custody after a woman and a young girl were found stabbed in Queensland. Emergency services were called around 10.30pm last night to a Rosewood address and found a 39-year-old woman and an 11-year-old girl with numerous stab wounds to the abdomen. Police say a 16-year-old-boy, who lives with both females, was taken into custody while both victims were transported to hospital in critical condition. A crime scene has been declared and investigations into the circumstances of the incident are continuing. A UK high court judge has rejected all eight grounds of Julian Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal against his extradition order to the US on espionage charges. His wife, Stella Assange, says he will contest the ruling: On Tuesday next week, my husband Julian Assange will make a renewed application for appeal to the High Court. The matter will then proceed to a public hearing before two new judges at the High Court and we remain optimistic that we will prevail, and that Julian will not be extradited to the United States where he faces charges that could result in him spending the rest of his life in a maximum security prison for publishing true information that revealed war crimes committed by the US government. Models for a national firearms register to help police tackle gun violence will be discussed by Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s police ministers, AAP reports. Attorney-general Mark Dreyfus will chair the meeting on Friday, where options for a register will be put forward by state and territory ministers. The decision follows the murders of Queensland police officers Constable Matthew Arnold and Constable Rachel McCrow, who were killed on a regional property by a trio of conspiracy theorists in December last year. Dreyfus said the governments had undertaken \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extensive efforts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to progress the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical public safety initiative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: A national firearms register would provide police across all Australian jurisdictions with timely and accurate information to assess firearms risks and protect the community from harm. I look forward to continuing to work constructively with my colleagues on this important initiative. The options for a register will then be provided to national cabinet for consideration. The Australian Federal Police Association has called for a national gun database since 2019. And welcome to the live news blog this Friday. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Natasha May and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be with you into the afternoon. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s police ministers are gathering today to discuss models for a national firearms register to help police tackle gun violence. The attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, will chair the meeting, which was promised after the deaths of two police officers and a civilian in the Wieambilla shooting last year. Meanwhile, Uber is introducing a green rideshare option in Australia dedicated to zero and low-emission vehicles.

Appointed as chief health officer in 2019, he was responsible for overseeing the Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which included one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest lockdowns and restrictions such as a curfew and five-kilometre travel limit. His position garnered him celebrity status, but also made him the target of conspiracy theories and death threats. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Sutton said the pressure of the public role, including fronting near-daily press conferences and inquiries, took a toll on him and his family. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I accept in a crisis that that has to sit on your shoulders, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no escaping that and I was \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in the midst of that beast for a long time. Victoria carried the heavy load in that regard,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told reporters on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On the one hand, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helped me to grow personally and professionally. On the other hand, it nearly crushed me and it certainly weighed upon my family life, and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want them to have to carry that in the same way ever again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A visibly emotional Sutton described his family as his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rock\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and thanked them, alongside his colleagues at the health department for their support. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the cumulative 16-hour days, sprinting for six months without a day off and you know, you can throw in the vitriol and the death threats and the intrusions and the kind of barrage of lies that you see especially in social media,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Critiques are totally fine, accountability is appropriate for any public office holder. But the BS that is sometimes spouted out there is quite extraordinary. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As much as you can set it aside, it still weighs on you because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s directed so vociferously in your direction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In December 2021, new laws stripped the chief health officer of the power to declare a pandemic and enforce restrictions during a health crisis, with the responsibility handed to the premier and health minister. From this time, Sutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visibility began to fade, leading to reports of a clash with the premier, Daniel Andrews, which both have denied. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a great relationship the premier,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sutton said on Friday, though he acknowledged \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tensions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would always exist between public health advice and politics. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I come with my view and my filter, [and] they have broader considerations and they have constituents that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re accountable to. But we talked it through and we came to decisions collectively.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said knowing what he knows now, he has some regrets about the pandemic response but maintains he always put protecting the health and wellbeing of Victorians first. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a person in the world who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been part of the public health response who wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reflect on things they would do differently,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sutton said. He said the world came to act on the threat of Covid-19 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slowly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, including accepting the evidence of the airborne transmission of the virus. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wish the world had come to that earlier,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sutton said. The Department of Health secretary, Euan Wallace, said details of Sutton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation were yet to be finalised, including a departure date and replacement details. He thanked Sutton for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153keeping the community safe and informed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during the pandemic. The premier took to social media to also wish Sutton \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the very best\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his next role. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As CHO, Brett helped keep us informed, and above all, safe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. Former health minister Martin Foley said Sutton \u00e2\u20ac\u0153always spoke truth to power\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and by putting the public health response first, he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unequivocally saved lives\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/09/tottenham-and-leicester-james-maddison-leicester", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Tottenham and Newcastle battling to sign James Maddison from Leicester", "lead": "Tottenham are battling with Newcastle to sign James Maddison after Leicester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relegation from the Premier League", "author": "Fabrizio Romano", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T08:23:20Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896793", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dc84290c3b0aed8890b0c3d2655be07929eba7e1/0_96_2079_1247/500.jpg", "body": "Tottenham are battling with Newcastle to sign James Maddison after Leicester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relegation from the Premier League.

Reeves, who is keen to demonstrate fiscal responsibility, said Labour would now \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ramp up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the annual \u00c2\u00a328bn plan by halfway through a first parliament. The party had promised to spend \u00c2\u00a328bn a year on green investment until 2030 from the first year after coming to power. However, Reeves said she could not have predicted the market crash caused by the former prime minister Liz Truss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans for unfunded borrowing for tax cuts last autumn, which created the difficult economic conditions including higher interests rates affecting the cost of debt repayment. She said the priority was sticking to Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal rule, that debt must be falling as a share of national income after five years \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No plan can be built that is not a rock of economic and fiscal responsibility \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I will never play fast and loose with the public finances,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reeves said on Friday. She told BBC Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme her fiscal rules would be non-negotiable, so Labour would move to the \u00c2\u00a328bn green investment gradually rather than immediately if the party won the next election. Reeves said she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the same page\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, and Ed Miliband, the shadow energy secretary, regarding the need to scale back the ambition of the plan. After the announcement, Miliband tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want Britain to borrow to invest in the green economy. They want us to back down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But Keir, Rachel and I will never let that happen. Britain needs this \u00c2\u00a328bn a year plan and that is what we are committed to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reeves unveiled the plan to spend \u00c2\u00a328bn a year on climate measures two years ago, promising to be the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first green chancellor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and it remains the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest spending pledge. Labour has already committed to using parts of the fund for a range of green schemes, including \u00c2\u00a360bn to pay for home insulation and \u00c2\u00a38bn to invest in green industries. The Guardian revealed this month that shadow cabinet ministers had asked Reeves to expand the fund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s green mission and use it to pay for a series of capital spending projects, such as housing or transport infrastructure. Reeves had indicated to colleagues there would be no additional money to pay for major infrastructure spending, leaving shadow ministers battling to claim a share of the green fund for their own projects. The Conservatives responded by claiming that shadow ministers had realised the policy would lead to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disaster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and sought to stress that Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ultimate goal remained to reach the \u00c2\u00a328bn figure, which they said would worsen the economy. The Conservative party chair, Greg Hands, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Keir Starmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main economic policy is in tatters, after even he and Rachel Reeves realised it would lead to disaster. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter if they try and pretend otherwise, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan remains to stick \u00c2\u00a328bn of borrowing on the government credit card which will lead to higher inflation and higher interest rates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some experts suggested it had never been credible that Labour would find \u00c2\u00a328bn for green investment in the first year after entering office. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bit too much excitement on \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLabour waters down\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00c2\u00a328bn green investment plans. New phrasing is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00c2\u00a328bn/year in the second half of the parliament at the latest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Anyone thinking a new government was going to be able to ramp up \u00c2\u00a328bn a year from day one hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t met the British state.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Environmental groups responded with dismay to the delay. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of politics, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any U-turn would be a huge mistake. Without the necessary immediate investment, we will lose out on the creation of thousands of jobs needed as we phase out fossil fuels, and we will lose out on the opportunity to put green tech industries at the centre of our economy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rachel Reeves rightly cites the opportunities of green growth, but this prevarication on confirming the scale of investment needed from the start of a new Labour government risks throwing in the towel on the global race in green tech, with the US, China and the EU already far ahead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Others within Labour said the move underlined the case for more wealth taxes instead. Richard Burgon, a Labour MP and former shadow cabinet minister under Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasingly clear that a wealth tax has a key role to play in providing the resources needed to invest in our public services and to tackle climate change. An annual tax of 1.5% on wealth above \u00c2\u00a310m would raise \u00c2\u00a315bn per year.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/09/damir-imamovic-the-world-and-all-that-it-holds-review", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "Damir Imamovi\u00c4\u2021: The World and All That It Holds review | Jude Rogers's folk album of the month", "lead": "The Bosnian musician combines Slavic sevdah, Sephardic Jewish and original songs to tell the story of two soldiers who fall in love during the first world war", "author": "Jude Rogers", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T08:00:54Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896798", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/726a6fe76e9025dcfba777a73cf34b8d713ef6f3/0_23_5184_3110/500.jpg", "body": "After an adolescence sheltering from the siege of Sarajevo in the Bosnian war, Damir Imamovi\u00c4\u2021 dedicated his musical life to researching, performing and making accessible the sevdalinka (AKA sevdah) of his childhood.

Written as a companion piece to his friend Aleksandar Hemon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s novel of the same name, it amplifies the story of two male Bosnian soldiers, one Muslim, one Jewish, who fall in love during the first world war. Imamovi\u00c4\u2021 combines sevdalinka with Sephardic Jewish songs and intricately written originals to reflect how these characters sing to each other. Centuries-old ballads crackle with urgent emotions. In the 15th-century Anderleto, Imamovi\u00c4\u2021\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing of his Persian lute, pressing and tingling, frames a tale of adultery in a magical balance of beauty and dread. Snijeg Pade (The Snow Has Fallen), a folk song about the unfairness of a forced, loveless marriage, packs a different, dirge-like, grungy power: after Imamovi\u00c4\u2021 performed it at Pride in Sarajevo in 2019, the LGBTQ+ movement in the Balkans adopted it as an unofficial anthem. Imamovi\u00c4\u2021 rewrites the last two verses of Te\u00c5\u00a1ko Je Ljubit Tajno (It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hard to Love in Secret) to create a triumphant narrative for the male protagonists, too.

Moving out of her on-campus dorm and closing the book on her sophomore year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a busy week ahead of me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zhang told reporters on Sunday after her milestone win at the Mizuho Americas Open. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not golf-related.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a dizzying stretch for the 20-year-old prodigy from Orange county, who shaded Jennifer Kupcho in a sudden-death playoff over the weekend at Liberty National Golf Club to become the second player ever \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and first since Beverly Hanson in 1951 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to win an LPGA tournament on her first crack. At the Jersey City course in the shadow of the Manhattan skyline, Zhang bested a stacked field that included seven of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 10 players, earning $412,500 in prize money, a name-check from Tiger Woods and a place in the history books. Zhang was already a well-known entity among golf fans before last week. She spent a record 141 weeks as the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-ranked amateur golfer, winning the US Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Amateur in 2020, the US Girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Junior in 2021 and the Augusta National Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Amateur in April. Her school-record 12 victories in 20 starts at Stanford \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where she became the first ever woman to win multiple individual national college championships \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was even better than Woods\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 11-for-26 clip during his time with the Cardinal. Owing to recent changes allowing college athletes to profit on their name, image and likeness, she has amassed a growing portfolio of sponsors that includes Adidas, Beats by Dre, Callaway, Delta and Rolex. But after breaking through for her maiden title faster than Annika Sorenstam (who needed 34 starts), Lorena Ochoa (30), Nancy Lopez and Lydia Ko (10 apiece), to say nothing of Tiger (five), Zhang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile has reached new heights and stoked an anticipation unlike anything seen around the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game in the US since Michelle Wie entered the paying ranks aged 15. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I honestly didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even expect to make the cut,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zhang said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And the reason why I say this is because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think about my expectations a lot. I think about playing the golf course. I think about trying to shoot the best score that I can. The expectation for me winning did not even cross my mind. I was just playing my game. I was having a good time out there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This time last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d have known it from her impeccable results \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Zhang found herself battling with the mental and physical rigors that came with sustaining her elite level. She credits her more relaxed approach and emphasis on process over results with her ability to compartmentalize pressure and deliver on the biggest stages of her career. Take her long-sought win at Augusta National in April, where she went off as the hot favorite, watched a five-stroke lead evaporate on Saturday before hunkering down and winning in a playoff the next day. Or this past week, where she followed her 70-69-66 start with Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-over 74 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including a missed eight-foot putt on the 18th hole that could have closed the show \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before finishing the job with a highlight-reel approach shot on the second playoff hole. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let yourself get too loose, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve definitely kept a lot of things in perspective now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zhang told the No Laying Up podcast in March. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Being in the longevity of this game. For me, I was very much living in the moment, but at the same time I was placing so much emphasis into every single moment that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been living in. That gets to you quite a bit. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve realized that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to be a way to try to live on a daily basis without having to be so hardcore.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zhang, who plans on remaining enrolled at Stanford and completing her degree while she plays on the pro circuit, accepted LPGA membership after her milestone victory, skyrocketing from No 482 to No 62 in the world rankings. Her next start will be the KPMG Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PGA Championship at Baltusrol followed by a July trip to Pebble Beach, where the US Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Open will be staged for the first time. A spot at next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Paris Olympics appears there for the taking. The women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tour is deeper and more competitive than ever, but a lack of the sorts of crossover stars that help boost TV rights fees and tournament purses has no doubt held it back in a crowded US marketplace. Zhang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s magnetic blend of skill, humility and personality could be just what the LPGA needs to help grow the game and narrow the widening prize-money gap with the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tour. So far, so good. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to continue trying to carve a path for young kids to just follow your dreams,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so thankful that the young kids enjoy me, enjoy my golf, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just so thankful for the support. So I will continue to do what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue to fight. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue to work hard. Hopefully everyone can follow along.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/09/australian-governments-impose-mandatory-packaging-rules-on-industry-to-cut-waste", "primaryCategory": "environment", "title": "Australian governments impose recycling rules after packaging industry fails on waste", "lead": "New rules agreed at meeting of environment ministers welcomed as breakthrough by conservationists", "author": "Adam Morton Climate and environment editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T07:57:17Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896808", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f6e2d61030698b0b0a34edb42aef5876c93eb8ac/0_272_4308_2585/500.jpg", "body": "Industry will be forced to do more to cut waste and boost recycling after Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s federal and state governments agreed for the first time to impose mandatory packaging rules on manufacturers and retailers. The agreement, at a meeting of environment ministers in Sydney on Friday, was welcomed by conservationists as a major breakthrough after years of voluntary industry action has failed to reduce waste. The federal environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic agreement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd meant packaging would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153subject to strict new government rules\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A communique released after the meeting said a new regulatory scheme would shift the country towards a circular economy that would minimise waste and lead to materials being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recovered, reused, recycled and reprocessed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It promised compulsory rules for packaging design based on international best practice and that harmful chemicals and contaminants would be regulated out. A roadmap would be developed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153harmonise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd kerbside waste collection across the country and a framework for recycled content traceability would be introduced to give business confidence to use recycled materials, it said. Plibersek said while some in the industry had voluntarily reduced their impact, it had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just not enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. An official review in April found Australia was recycling just 18% of plastic packaging, and would fall well short of a target of 70% by 2025. The minister said the call for regulation had been supported by some major companies including Nestl\u00c3\u00a9, Unilever and Coca-Cola. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to dramatically reduce packaging waste, and the harmful chemicals that destroy our environment. We see packaging in the guts of dead birds, floating in our oceans, destroying nature as it takes generations to degrade,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Put simply, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making too much, using too much, and too much is ending up in landfill.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Boomerang Alliance, a coalition of 55 environment groups, said the agreement was the first \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial and meaningful step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to deal with waste in 20 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is absolutely the right decision, and a key first step to tackle the growing waste and plastic pollution harming the oceans and climate,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the alliance\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, Jeff Angel, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mandatory standards for recycled content and targets are essential to create the economic rationale for new recycling and reprocessing plants. New rules to minimise wasteful packaging will also help tackle the plastic waste and pollution tidal wave projected by the UN.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Angel said the agreement needed to be followed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a comprehensive product stewardship scheme\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that forced industry to pay for collection and recycling programs. He said it must avoid the mistakes of the failed REDcycle scheme, which led to 12,000 tonnes of soft plastics collected at supermarkets being stockpiled in warehouses across three states while consumers were told it was being recycled. Much of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recyclable rubbish was sent overseas until August 2019, when then prime minister Scott Morrison announced a ban on the export of waste plastic, paper, glass and tyres. Coalition and Labor governments subsequently announced hundreds of millions in funding for recycling facilities, but until now resisted rules that ensured they would be viable. The announcement comes amid a global push to cut plastic use. Plibersek attended negotiations in Paris on a proposed global plastic treaty earlier this month. The Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association, representing companies that deal with rubbish and recycling, welcomed an agreement, saying it meant there would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153finally be real action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on packaging. The association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Gayle Sloan, said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a great start\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the first step on the path to creating the level playing field industry desperately needs between virgin and recycled materials\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The environment group World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia said the agreement would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have a major impact on Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plastic pollution crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/09/uk-weather-temperatures-30c-weekend-health-alert-issued", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "UK temperatures could reach 30C this weekend as health alert upgraded", "lead": "Experts warn heat poses threat to wider population, while thunderstorms also forecast", "author": "Jamie Grierson", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T07:53:19Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896812", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dc7d5c244ba1368db134d37b7dd34fabef386cd3/0_78_4353_2613/500.jpg", "body": "UK temperatures could peak at 30C (86F) this weekend as public health experts warn the heat poses a threat to the wellbeing of the wider population.

The shock announcement marked the culmination of a year of disruption, player poaching and heated litigation. It also brought attention to Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing ambitions in sports and raised the possibility that the kingdom will use its seemingly limitless resources to buy into US sporting behemoths such as the NFL and NBA. While US professional sports are highly lucrative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the NFL alone generated $18bn in revenue last year and its most valuable team, the Dallas Cowboys are worth $8bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Saudis are not after short-term profits. Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement with the PGA Tour marks the latest in a series of high-profile investments aiming to transform a controversial kingdom marred with human rights abuses into a tantalizing hub for global sports and entertainment events. These investments are purportedly part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Vision 2030 initiative, which aims to reduce Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavy dependence on oil by developing other industries. Saudi Arabia already hosts a Formula One race, WWE shows, and the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s richest horse race. The country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sovereign wealth fund also financed the purchase of the Premier League\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Newcastle United, and is in the process of tempting high-profile footballers to join Cristiano Ronaldo in the Saudi Pro League \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an effort that could be worth more than $1bn in wages for 20 foreign players. And there are signs that the kingdom is expanding its sports empire in the US. According to documentation acquired by the Guardian in 2019, Saudi Arabia enlisted the services of an international consulting firm to lobby leading commissioners and sports bodies in North America. Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud, the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister of sports, and other Saudi lobbyists went on to meet with several US-based sports leagues. Prince Abdulaziz met with representatives from MLB and the NBA, as well as the commissioners of MLS and the NHL. Princess Reema Bandar al-Saud, who now serves as the Saudi ambassador to the US, also met with Kobe Bryant in 2018 to discuss the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153development of basketball in Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. While the documents do not include any follow-up information regarding the meetings, they shed light on Saudi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious sports strategy and its interest in US sports leagues. The most obvious league for Saudi investment would be the NBA. Basketball is popular in Saudi Arabia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its national league was established in 1976 and its men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team won the Arab Championship in 2018. With the likes of Ronaldo heading to the Saudi Pro League, could an investment in the NBA see ageing stars like LeBron James or Chris Paul fatten their wallets with one final season in the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s league? More significantly, the NBA would offer a chance to widen the soft power that is behind much of Saudi sporting ambitions. The NBA is a true global league, and has tens of millions of fans in Asia, Europe, South America and Africa who cut across a wide range of nationalities, races and religions. The framework is there too. In December 2022, the NBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s board of governors voted to let sovereign wealth funds, pensions and endowments acquire minority stakes in its teams, widening the pool of prospective team owners. Executives from Abu Dhabi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mubadala Investment Co and Qatar Investment Authority have since expressed interest in NBA ownership, and Saudi Arabia is likely to follow suit. There is one more facet of the NBA that will appeal to Saudi Arabia. The free market of the Premier League means it is fairly simple to buy success \u00e2\u20ac\u201c witness how Newcastle have gone from also-rans to the Champions League since Saudi investment in the club. That is much tougher in US pro sports, where salary caps ensure a (mostly) level playing field. However, the NBA has a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd salary cap, meaning teams can go over the cap in return for certain penalties. Another potential target is MLB, which also has a soft salary cap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something that billionaire owners have already been happy to exploit. The league eased its ownership rules in 2019 to allow investment funds to acquire minority stakes in multiple teams. Three years later, MLB awarded its franchises the commercial rights to sign sponsorship deals in foreign markets, a process similar to that undertaken by the NFL. This could lead to sponsorship deals and other partnerships between franchises and the kingdom. Saudi Arabia could also follow in the footsteps of its regional rival, the United Arab Emirates, which established a Dubai-based professional baseball league focused on the Middle East and southwest Asia. This effectively expanded the UAE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence into areas often ignored by the West, although baseball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s global popularity is small compared to the NBA. It is worth noting that Saudi lobbyists did not meet with representatives from the NFL, which has a sole-ownership system and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd salary cap that cannot be crossed. Such limitations greatly reduce Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic power and thus make the NFL a far less likely target for potential partnership or acquisition. For example, French star Karim Benzema is set to make roughly $215m a year to play for Saudi football club Al-Ittihad. In contrast, the salary cap for an entire NFL team in 2023 was $224.8m. The NFL is also notoriously run like an old boys\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 club for very rich old white men. How willing team owners would be to vote Saudis into a league that, as ESPN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bomani Jones once said, is run as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153celebration of masculinity and America\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is debatable. Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan, who is Pakistani American, is the only non-white controlling owner in the NFL. Having said that, the number of people who can afford to buy an NFL team is vanishingly small. When Jerry Jones bought the Dallas Cowboys in 1989 he paid $150m. This year Dan Snyder agreed to sell the Washington Commanders for $6bn, a sum far out of the reach of most of even the richest people in America but chump change for Saudi Arabia. Despite Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ever-growing influence in the world of sports, there are several obstacles that could limit its American ambitions, including US regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anti-trust enforcers. Ron Wyden, who serves as the US senate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finance chair, called the PGA/LIV Golf merger a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shameless cash grab\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and planned to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dive into every nook and cranny of Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a start: US officials need to consider whether a deal will give the Saudi regime improper control or access to US real estate,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wyden said in a statement. Assuming the merger is allowed to go through, it will be interesting to see if US regulators attempt to protect other major sports leagues. Relations between the US and Saudi Arabia have been strained in recent years but the Biden administration has attempted to re-engage with the kingdom amid volatile oil prices. Though Saudi Arabia does not have a storied history in golf, it managed to gain control of one of America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favorite pastimes within a year of launching its own rival entity. Time will tell whether other US sports will be tempted by the allure of the kingdom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unrestricted capital."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/09/anarchy-in-high-wycombe-the-real-story-of-the-sex-pistols-earliest-gigs", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "Anarchy in High Wycombe!

Unbeknown to her and her friends, there was musical entertainment: a band from London no one had heard of. She suspects the group had just phoned up and asked if they could play. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were so bad,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were dancing, having a good laugh. We thought they were a piss-take of a 60s band. Someone said they saw the drummer afterwards and he was crying because they were so terrible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Afterwards, the singer came over and asked Bradley about her clothes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If I dressed like that all the time. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had a difficult childhood and I think I expressed that through my clothes. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d butchered my hair: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tried to use henna and peroxide and it came out wrong \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bright orange. I was wearing ripped fishnets and a holey jumper. I had 11 ear piercings. I asked him what his name was. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcJohnny Rotten.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I was like: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bradley had just seen one of the Sex Pistols\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first gigs and was about to become one of their first fans. She liked them, terrible or not: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was an energy, a sense of humour, a dissatisfaction with the world that fitted mine. I went to see them in Welwyn Garden City, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had a row during soundcheck and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play. They used to give me lifts. It was all quite sweet. We were all teenagers. On Valentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Day, I walked round St Albans with John, hand in hand, wearing a dustbin liner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The story of the Sex Pistols tends to hinge around a handful of legendary gigs in major cities: the Screen on the Green and the 100 Club in London, their horrible last stand at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, and especially their June 1976 show at Manchester\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lesser Free Trade Hall, famously the spark that ignited Joy Division, the Fall and the Smiths among others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Gig That Changed the World, as one subsequent book put it, with very Mancunian self-confidence. But the Sex Pistols played dozens of other shows, many in locations that now seem faintly improbable: way off the map of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s limited touring circuit and peculiar even by the more expansive standards of the time. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard not to look at their 70s gig listings and boggle: what happened when the Sex Pistols played Cromer, Keighley or Dunstable? What was the impact of their appearances in Whitby, Runton and Northallerton? What might have happened had the infamous Anarchy tour been allowed to fetch up, as planned, in Paignton? Depending on who you believe, the weirdness of the Sex Pistols\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 touring schedule was either a brilliant masterplan by manager Malcolm McLaren to reach disaffected youth across Britain or the result of a clueless manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s desperation to get a gig anywhere. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was no strategy involved,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd John Lydon complained in his autobiography Anger Is an Energy, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was all happen-chance, fly by the seat of your pants.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sometimes the results were tragicomic. Peter Smith was 19 in 1976, an inveterate gig-goer from Sunderland. His interest piqued by reading early articles on the Sex Pistols, he drove to Whitby to see them. But the staff at the Royal Ballroom had never heard of the band. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They suggested trying a little place around the back. There was a poster that said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSaturday night disco featuring top band the Sex Pistols.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was empty, bar the band in a corner. Rotten ordered chicken and chips at the bar. Then the disco fans filed in, dancing to Abba before the Pistols got on stage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think they started with Anarchy in the UK. John was wearing a tam and bondage gear, hanging off the microphone, sneering. Me and my girlfriend loved it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the energy, John\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stance, the way he looked, the amateurishness of it, the raw power.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They were in the minority. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There were people with their hands over their ears, and after half an hour at most, the DJ turns their sound off and the disco back on. The Sex Pistols just stood there looking at each other then walked off. People started dancing and I drove home. I met John years later at a book signing and he said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember. He was adamant nobody had ever thrown him offstage, which was quite funny.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a characteristic story. In Pistols mythology, if these gigs are even mentioned, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as provoking hatred, fury and violence. Shanne Bradley recalls a gig in High Wycombe that turned into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit of a bundle \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 there was more of a laddish element. Rotten used to take the piss out of the audience. [The band] started getting a load of abuse, Rotten lent over the stage and somebody jumped on him and thumped him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yet everyone I speak to says the Pistols were met with widespread lack of interest: the most virulent reaction they provoked was confusion. Chris Sullivan had seen them in London, but when they played in his native Wales, at the Stowaway Club in Newport in September 1976, he says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a Monday night, very under the radar. There were maybe 40 people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a load of hippies drinking cider and [future Visage frontman] Steve Strange in a ripped-up rubber T-shirt. People were just bemused.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But at every gig, there was someone who would end up converted. Pauline Murray first encountered the band in Northallerton in May 1976, at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a small nightclub called Sayers at the end of a row of garages. It was the normal clientele, 30 people sat at tables, waiting for the turn. They were in a state of shock. But for me, the energy really hit, in every single way. It was so primitive compared to everything else I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Two nights later, Murray would see them supporting glam band Doctors of Madness in Middlesbrough town hall. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a real turning point, because they absolutely destroyed the Doctors of Madness. It was like they knew that something new had overtaken them. While they were on, the Sex Pistols went through their dressing room and nicked all their stuff.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Murray was absolutely right: something new had overtaken glam. Talking to people who saw the Sex Pistols play, even in unlikely locations, you can plot their astonishing trajectory. Three months after the Newport gig, Chris Sullivan saw them again in Wales, at the Castle Cinema in Caerphilly, and everything had changed. It was two weeks after the band\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s infamous appearance on the Today show, where guitarist Steve Jones called interviewer Bill Grundy a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dirty fucker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a fucking rotter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Seventeen out of 24 gigs on the ensuing Anarchy tour were cancelled, or rather, banned by town councils and university chancellors. The Caerphilly show went ahead, but pubs and shops in the town shuttered early, and it was picketed by religious groups: huge crowds singing hymns, making speeches, trying to block entry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we drove past, we were like: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFucking hell, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going on there?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Sullivan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had to go through a gauntlet of middle-aged women in raincoats with pointy glasses and curlers, singing Onward Christian Soldiers, who were trying to grab us and hit us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He laughs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite uncomfortable when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a 6ft 2in teenager and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re being manhandled by someone who looks like your granny \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what do you do? The gig was great: they were much better than in Newport. But the audience was basically the same \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 bloody hippies and us lot, Steve Strange pogoing at the front.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strange, he says: the people outside were angrier than the Sex Pistols, who were supposed to be overturning Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s moral order in a fit of nihilistic rage. Maybe the pickets were expressing a similar impotent fury in a very different way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In Wales in the 70s, there was no work. The mines were shutting, it was really poor. People were angry and they directed it at us. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just bible-bashers: it was thugs who specifically came to beat people up. When we left, there was a running battle. Somebody could have got killed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Perhaps no band could expect to last long under that kind of scrutiny and pressure, particularly one this combustible. By the time Simon Parker saw them in the Winter Gardens, Penzance, in summer 1977, he says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were nearly finished.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The end-of-the-line town had a thriving punk scene and had already hosted the Ramones, the Damned and the Adverts, but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Pistols gig was almost the end of that, the close of a very brief era\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By now, the band could only avoid having their gigs cancelled by playing under pseudonyms. But in Penzance, the show \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Mystery Band of International Repute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was dangerously crowded. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The local council were the only people who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the secret,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Parker. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were mythic figures by that stage. There was a guy using the telephone box outside, and Sid Vicious knocked on the door because he wanted to use the phone. That seemed very exciting, that they did ordinary things.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153explosive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gig barely lasted 30 minutes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Johnny Rotten came on stage and glared to get the DJ to stop the music. There was a lot of spitting, which I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember at any other gig. A shower of it, really bloody awful. People further back had brought plastic spoons that they were spitting in and wanging it at the band. Maybe it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best gig ever, but it was the best event \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was so much excitement, people queueing up the street.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These might not have been gigs that changed the world or spawned an era-defining scene, but they each had an impact on at least a handful of people. Peter Smith remained a long-haired hippy but says it opened his mind musically. Pauline Murray formed punk band Penetration; Shanne Bradley \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who fell out with the Sex Pistols, and later discovered to her indignation that she was the subject of Satellite, the scathing B-side of Holidays in the Sun \u00e2\u20ac\u201c formed the Nips with Shane MacGowan. Chris Sullivan became a fixture of London clubland, the co-founder of the Wag Club, the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hippest 80s night spot. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing the Sex Pistols and that DIY attitude gave me and Steve Strange the impetus to do what we did,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because we saw that people like us could do it. I think that was the most important thing about those Sex Pistols gigs. It gave you the strength to have a go. You saw punk fail miserably after the Grundy thing, but then you think to yourself: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAt least if you have a go, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go to bed at night saying: I wish I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d tried.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 PZ77 by Simon Parker is out now."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/modern-football-manchester-city-champions-league", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "The dismal story of modern football can be summed up in two words: Manchester City | Phil Mongredien", "lead": "Champions League glory is within the grasp of this team of well-heeled superstars.

I would be lying if I were to claim that I could remember much of the game now. I was so captivated by the spectacle, and particularly the unimaginable noise of 40,000 people shouting vaguely in unison, that I spent much of the time looking anywhere but the pitch. That day marked the start of a ritual for the two of us that would endure until I left home at 18. Every other Saturday Dad would drive us to the ground from our home in Nottingham, with the radio tuned to Birmingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial station, BRMB, which always had a more partisan, Villa-centric take on sports reporting than the BBC. Upon walking the final mile to Villa Park, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d head first to the club car park, where the players and managers of both sides would each have to fight off an army of hangers-on, pre-teen autograph hunters and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once \u00e2\u20ac\u201c gangland enforcers apparently looking to collect a debt from a player. Andy Gray, Brian Little, Martin Peters, Alan Hudson, Bobby Robson \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 reader, you may not know them, but I harassed them all, and still have the written evidence. And what a time to become obsessed with football, and Villa in particular. Masterminded by unsmiling manager Ron Saunders, they were just about to embark on a remarkable renaissance that within seven years would see them win the league for the first time since the Edwardian era and then top that by winning the European Cup. They were halcyon days; certainly they were more egalitarian. At the start of every season there would be seven or eight teams that could legitimately fancy their chances of winning the league. At the time, Liverpool were the best team in the country, but they were far from infallible. In 1975-76, they did come out on top, but only by a single point from QPR, and they only won 55% of their fixtures. Fifty years later, that element of unpredictability seems like a relic from a distant age. Now, Manchester City \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who take on Inter Milan in Istanbul on Saturday in a bid to win the Champions League for the first time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are indisputably the best team in the country. Indeed, they have just won their fifth league title in six years. During those six seasons, they won an astonishing 76% of their league matches. Bookmakers are understandably offering very long odds on any other team usurping them next season. Fans of other clubs now spend their summers wistfully wondering whether they might dare to dream of finishing as runners-up. Yes, each of City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s players is phenomenally talented. Yes, as a team they play absolutely beautiful football of a calibre that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have imagined in the 1970s, as I watched Villa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no-nonsense centre-half Ken McNaught boot the ball out of the ground one more time. But how has this happened? In a word: money. In 2008 the club was bought by a private equity fund owned by Abu Dhabi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s royal family. They proceeded to spend their near limitless petro-funds hoovering up many of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best players, as well as the best coach. Of course, the arrival on the scene of the Abu Dhabi United Group wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the starting point for domestic football\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition from race to parade. The Premier League was seemingly formed in 1992 as a means of concentrating wealth and power among the biggest clubs. But the gradual abandonment of any pretence of there being a level playing field happened rapidly after the takeover of, first, Chelsea (by Roman Abramovich in 2003) and then City. Ultimately such stifling dominance of the game by one team, such a yawn supremacy, is hardly healthy for a game that relies on some degree of competitiveness. This thought came to mind as I watched City demolish Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final last month and heard the commentators and pundits on BT Sport insist that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd would be hoping that they would go on to finally win club football\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest prize. But just who is this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Away from the TV studios, many football fans actively loathe the way that City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial muscle has distorted the English game over the past 15 years. Having succeeded in making the Premier League so boringly predictable, extending that chokehold to Europe by beating Inter on Saturday would hardly be something to celebrate. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before we even get to the more than 100 financial doping charges brought against the club by the Premier League earlier this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which they vociferously deny. As long as this enormous question mark is hanging over whether they reached their position of dominance by effectively cheating, why would any neutral want them to (further) prosper? Hating other teams has always been as much a part of football fandom as supporting your own. These days my personal hierarchy of revulsion is determined by how morally bankrupt a club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners are, rather than more traditional factors such as local rivalries or whether or not Lee Bowyer was playing for them. Indeed, since Newcastle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeover by the sovereign wealth fund belonging to Saudi Arabia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a country that dismembers dissenting journalists, although you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be forgiven for thinking this is less important than Kieran Trippier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free-kick prowess \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they have seized the role of apex supervillains. (Clubs can be rehabilitated: throughout the Abramovich years, I despised Chelsea, now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just funny.) Cheering on foreign opposition against English sides is certainly not any kind of new phenomenon, either \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after all, if you really loathe a club, why should that not extend beyond national boundaries? In the mid-1990s, Arsenal played a cynical, but successful, brand of anti-football, characterised by defensive tactics and gamesmanship. When they were defeated by Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Real Zaragoza in the 1995 Cup Winners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Cup final thanks to a sublime last-minute Nayim goal, it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solely fans in Aragon and Tottenham who were celebrating. And if there was a funnier moment in the whole of 1975 than Dirty Leeds unluckily losing the European Cup final to two late Bayern Munich goals, well, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve forgotten it. Nowadays, the continent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest clubs are effectively interchangeable, aggressively marketed, multinational brands. Almost all of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best players, whatever their nationality, belong to a small cabal of English, French, German, Italian and Spanish clubs. Whereas once an occasional glimpse of a top European side felt like an exotic treat, TV coverage has made the football world much smaller. This season, for instance, UK broadcasters have shown AC Milan more times than Villa. Is it any wonder that matches between English and international clubs have lost any element of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153us v them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? With such familiarity with the top continental leagues, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not even English exceptionalism as a reason to cheer on City on Saturday. Indeed, in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interconnected world it feels curiously parochial and old-fashioned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Brexity, even \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for neutrals to insist on supporting English club sides in European competition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd want Manchester City to win the Champions League?

This slow-moving coup is designed to empower the continent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest clubs, enabling them to exert greater control over the sport. Marshall conveniently highlights various clubs in his article, without recognising that they are, in fact, the dominant forces within their respective countries. The financial windfall from European competitions has led to significant distortions within their domestic leagues. We also should not forget that Marshall was at the ECA in 2019 when it presented an early version of the super league project together with Uefa. Fortunately Uefa realised that it would destroy football after a revolt among clubs and in the media, but Marshall has little credibility when it comes to the future of European football. Furthermore, it is essential to call out the democratic deficit within the ECA, a crucial point that Marshall conveniently glosses over. Of the 330 clubs holding a right to vote, only 140 possess full voting rights, while the remaining 190 have their voting power significantly limited. This disparity in voting rights showcases the undemocratic nature of the ECA, where a minority of clubs holds a disproportionate amount of influence and decision-making power. Such an imbalance undermines the principles of fairness, transparency, and inclusivity that should be the bedrock of any representative organisation. By downplaying the significance of this democratic deficit, Marshall fails to address the concerns raised by many stakeholders within European football. The concentration of power in the hands of a select few clubs not only perpetuates existing inequalities but also stifles the voices and aspirations of other clubs. It is imperative that we acknowledge and rectify this issue to ensure a more equitable and democratic future for European football, which is why I support the nascent Union of European Clubs. The ECA is intensifying the influence of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest clubs while disregarding the interests of aspirational clubs. The lack of a genuine democratic framework within the ECA further exacerbates this issue. To strengthen European football, we must prioritise the domestic leagues as the foundation of the European football pyramid and ensure that Uefa funds flow more equitably to support aspirational clubs. Only through a fair, inclusive and democratic approach can we restore balance and safeguard the future of the beautiful game.

I catch myself on it when running out the door I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lived with Kojo since 2018. We met at university and moved in together after graduating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a good partnership \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a brother to me. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cycle, but Kojo has always had some drama with his bikes in London. He never used to lock them up properly so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve accompanied him to the police station on more than one occasion to make a police report when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been stolen. Then he got Nelson, this fancy bike through a cycle-to-work scheme, and decided to keep it inside. (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called Nelson). I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything against this during Covid, because all rules seemed to go out the window and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want Nelson to get stolen right after Kojo had bought \u00e2\u20ac\u0153him\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But now Nelson is pissing me off. Maybe because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been in this flat for a while and I fancy a change, or maybe because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m working from home more after changing jobs this year. But I just find the concept of a bike constantly in the corridor quite annoying. Bikes are cumbersome and I often catch my elbow or handbag on Nelson when running out of the door. I have suggested that Kojo keep him in the new bike storage hangar at the end of our road. It looks pretty affordable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00c2\u00a360 a year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Kojo says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford it. He gets all dramatic and says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poor Nelson, all the way out there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the hangar is 30 seconds from our house. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small price to pay to have more space in our tiny flat, but Kojo isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coming around to the idea. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to see some compromise. He recently suggested having a mounted bike rack in the kitchen so Nelson can hang up on the wall, but I am even less keen on the idea of a bike next to the space where I cook \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unhygienic and a real eyesore. Kojo and I get on well and this flat has been our home for a while, but it seems there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three of us living here and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign up to share my space with this housemate. Kojo says he and Nelson will be out of the flat more this summer if the weather is nice, but I know when winter comes, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be stuck catching my elbows on the bike again. The defence: Kojo I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already had two bikes stolen, and the thought of leaving this one outside at night makes me a bit sad In London, bike theft is a big issue. Ana\u00c3\u00afs doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really get that because she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never cycled. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been cycling for 12 years now and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had two bikes stolen, which is pretty good in the grand scheme of things. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got friends who stopped cycling because they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to buy any more bikes, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had so many stolen. During 2020 I got a new bike after my old one was stolen at the end of 2019. Then we went into lockdown and cycling was my release, so I was using my bike whenever I could. I got into the habit of bringing my bike into the flat because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite expensive. Ana\u00c3\u00afs first asked me if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider keeping Nelson outside, in the garden, but because he was new I said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather keep him in the house to protect his lovely blue finish. She was cool with it for a long time but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now asking me to take poor Nelson out into the street because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently had one of those pay-monthly bike storage sheds installed nearby. She thinks Nelson will be safe there, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably right, but I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to do it. I would have to walk three minutes to get to the shed every time I need my bike, which is every day, and I also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay the monthly storage fee. Ana\u00c3\u00afs, Nelson and I have lived together in harmony for three years now and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see why we should disrupt it. I allow Ana\u00c3\u00afs to keep five giant suitcases in our shared storage space and kitchen, so why can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t I keep Nelson in the corridor of our flat? He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take up too much space \u00e2\u20ac\u201c less than her suitcases, in fact. I like the idea of a bike storage facility in theory, but leaving him so far away from me at night makes me a little bit sad. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve told Ana\u00c3\u00afs I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m prepared to get a bike rack for the kitchen so Nelson can hang vertically from a rack there, but she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big fan of that idea, saying that bikes don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong in kitchens. What else can I say? Nelson is staying put then. Summer is here now so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be taking Nelson out most evenings and weekends. Ana\u00c3\u00afs won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even notice when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s here. The jury of Guardian readers Should Kojo park his fondness for Nelson and evict him from the flat? Nelson may be beautiful but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the way and potentially unhygienic when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the flat. However if Ana\u00c3\u00afs really wants the bike in storage, she should pay half the fees (at least!). Space is important in a home, but so is compromise. Stephanie, 35 Bike theft is a real worry, and while the hangar is affordable, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reasonable to want to keep a treasured possession in the home. Store it covered in the garden or get creative with a bike rack, but let this one slide, Ana\u00c3\u00afs. A \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brotherly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd housemate is far more valuable. Gautham, 37 The new secure hangar just three minutes away sounds ideal for Kojo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bike. Why create an obstacle in the hallway if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to? That said, Ana\u00c3\u00afs should store the suitcases in her own room. Shared space isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for clutter. Mary, 37 Shared areas are sacred, none more so than the kitchen. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for Nelson to either start sleeping in daddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room or become an adult bike and move in with his roommates three minutes away. Joey, 25 Given that the bike has already been in residence for three years, there is no case to answer. If bike storage was an issue, it should have been raised at the time. But Kojo needs to ask himself if he is willing to put friendship above his bike. Sarah, 50 Now you be the judge In our online poll below, tell us: should Kojo take Nelson off his pedestal?

Justin Welby said there was no justification for supporting the legislation, in a move that highlights deep divisions within the global Anglican church on LGBTQ+ issues. Uganda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Yoweri Museveni, signed the bill into law last month amid condemnation. The UK government said it was appalled by the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply discriminatory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bill. Joe Biden decried the act as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shameful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tragic violation of universal human rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Archbishop Stephen Kaziimba, the leader of the Ugandan church, praised the new law. He said homosexuality was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153currently a challenge in Uganda because it is being forced on us by outside, foreign actors against our will, against our culture, and against our religious beliefs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Welby said he had written to Kaziimba to express his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grief and dismay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the church\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for the law, describing it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a fundamental departure from our commitment to uphold the freedom and dignity of all people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a statement, Welby said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am deeply aware of the history of colonial rule in Uganda, so heroically resisted by its people. But this is not about imposing western values on our Ugandan Anglican sisters and brothers. It is about reminding them of the commitments we have made as Anglicans to treat every person with the care and respect they deserve as children of God. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Within the Anglican communion we continue to disagree over matters of sexuality, but \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 supporting such legislation is a fundamental departure from our commitment to uphold the freedom and dignity of all people. There is no justification for any province of the Anglican communion to support such laws.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He urged Kaziimba and the Ugandan church \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to reconsider their support for this legislation and reject the criminalisation of LGBTQ people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The global Anglican communion, which claims more than 85 million members worldwide, has been divided for decades over sexuality. Broadly speaking, liberal, declining churches in the developed world are more accepting of LGBTQ+ people while conservative, growing churches in sub-Saharan Africa insist on traditional biblical teaching on sex and marriage. Welby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement said the Ugandan church, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153like many Anglican provinces, holds to the traditional Christian teaching on sexuality and marriage set out in resolution i.10 of the 1998 Lambeth conference. That resolution also expressed a commitment to minister pastorally and sensitively to all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c regardless of sexual orientation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to condemn homophobia.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He called on international bodies that represent conservative churches \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to make explicitly and publicly clear that the criminalisation of LGBTQ people is something that no Anglican province can support: that must be stated unequivocally\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/09/afternoon-update-donald-trump-faces-possibility-of-jail-julian-assange-loses-appeal-and-tv-shows-for-succession-withdrawal", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Afternoon Update: Donald Trump faces possibility of jail; Julian Assange loses appeal; and TV shows for Succession withdrawal", "lead": "Latest charges could prove to be the most significant legal peril yet for former president", "author": "Antoun Issa", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T06:53:28Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896836", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5a48db4bb0b548a6724c7e00994cfaaa9247a3b8/0_0_3934_2361/500.jpg", "body": "Happy Friday!

The chancellor hopes to boost investment in the North Sea by agreeing to suspend the windfall tax on oil profits if the market price for Brent crude falls below $71.40 a barrel, and gas prices fall below 54p a therm, for a period of six months. The global oil price is now about $75 a barrel, and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gas price is about 64 p/th. The Treasury has put forward the change a little over six months after raising the energy profits levy from 25% to 35%, on top of the usual 40% rate of tax, and extending the regime by two years until 2028. It is expected to raise tens of billions of pounds to help cover the cost of the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support for energy bills. The government said its levy had raised about \u00c2\u00a32.8bn to date, and it did not expect the new changes to have an impact on the tax receipts based on current forecasts for energy market prices. The levy attracted fierce criticism from the North Sea industry, which claimed it could put the brakes on new investment in oil and gas projects at a time when the government hopes to increase domestic fossil fuel production. Industry critics also said the levy had a disproportionate impact on smaller, UK-based oil and gas producers, which pay most of their tax in the UK while the oil majors including BP and Shell pay only a small part of the global tax bill to the UK. Bumper profits at BP and Shell in recent months have prompted calls for a tougher windfall tax from Labour and campaign groups, who argue that oil and gas companies are benefiting from high energy prices at a time when many households are struggling to pay their bills. Gareth Davies MP, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is right that we recover excess profits resulting from Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war and use the money to help people with their energy bills.

The entry records the arrival of Tony, an indentured servant and the first known east Indian in North America. We know nothing about the real Tony. But Charry, who herself moved from India to the United States as a graduate student, spins a drama of hardship, dislocation and love, set in the struggling English colony of Jamestown in the 1630s. Charry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hero is born near what is now Chennai. His mother is a courtesan and her clients include an East India Company official, who complains about the weather and takes Tony on trips down the coast. When his mother dies, another agent agrees to take him into his service in London. But after only a few months in the city, Tony is kidnapped by thugs and sold into servitude in the New World. There, he acquires a new sequence of masters: an abusive drunkard, a bold backwoodsman, a physician with a secret. This sweeping coming-of-age tale is more than a little Dickensian. But what distinguishes The East Indian is not so much compulsive prose \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Charry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declarative sentences tell the story efficiently, but rarely sparkle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as vivid verisimilitude. As well as publishing several works of fiction in India, Charry is a historian specialising in 17th- and 18th-century cultural encounters, and her novel is packed with intriguing detail. In Virginia, Tony befriends other servants, tends crops in the poor soil, voyages up the James River and labours on the colony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wall \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is there to keep another kind of Indian at bay. Tobacco is sown in seedbeds covered in pine branches, while oak, hemlock and hickory crowd the woods. We are brought into a physician\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s storeroom stacked with jimson weed, quicksilver and chamomile. New arrivals sip watered-down ale and share tales of Lincolnshire, Essex and Italy, of glass-making, Shakespeare and the humble origins of puffed-up overseers. Others sing laments that might \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if the wind is right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be blown across the sea to west Africa. Charry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye for detail doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just add colour; it reveals a world in which commerce and colonialism have uprooted countless men and women. One of Tony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s masters, an adventurer named Archer, describes this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world in motion \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 an unfixed, unsettled place, every man a journeyman\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After he docks, Tony is asked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what manner of moor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153where are you really from\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of his age. This \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black imp\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, this Indian-but-not-Indian, does not fit neatly into the colony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerging social order. His word, he quickly learns, carries little weight in a dispute. Throughout The East Indian, Tony sees that it is brown and Black people who are blown the farthest, beaten the hardest, kept in servitude the longest. An escape bid carries an echo of the real 1640 case of John Punch, an African servant who was placed in lifetime servitude after trying to escape Virginia, and is considered the first enslaved person in the English colonies. At first, the arriving ships bring only a handful of African men and women, but by the 1640s they are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153packed to choking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with captives. The East Indian is no tragedy. Tony falls in love, gains medical knowledge and discovers the value of powdered unicorn horn in a tight spot. But he is swimming against the tide. The dreadful pull of inequality and racism is ever present, and the fear it will drag him under haunts the novel throughout. A greater narrative frames his story: while Tony inches his way out of servitude, colonies are spreading in both North America and the India of his childhood. By bringing a character from history\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s margins and placing him centre stage, Charry shows the human impact of these great forces, in a book of fascinating research and measured rage. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The East Indian by Brinda Charry is published by Scribner (\u00c2\u00a314.99).

On 10 June 1838, with the Myall Creek Station manager away, a dozen stockmen led by John Henry Fleming rounded up and brutally killed at least 28 Wirrayaraay women, children and elderly people while their young men were away helping another settler. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In several editorials published before, during and after two Sydney trials in late 1838 relating to the massacre, the Herald essentially campaigned for the 11 accused mass murderers to escape prosecution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an editorial in Friday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paper said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It also opposed the death sentence eventually handed to seven of the men.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In one editorial published ahead of the trials and amid a public debate about legal protections for Aboriginal people, the Herald proclaimed: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe whole gang of black animals are not worth the money the colonists will have to pay for printing the silly documents on which we have already wasted too much time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The SMH editor, Bevan Shields, says the attitude of the paper cannot be excused by the historical context as it was not necessarily shared by other publications at the time, which had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153much more respectful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd coverage.

The decision by the Nine Entertainment publication to apologise follows the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent series Cotton Capital, which saw the owner of the Guardian, the Scott Trust, apologise for the role the newspaper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founders had in transatlantic slavery. The Scott Trust said it expected to invest more than \u00c2\u00a310m (US$12.3m, A$18.4m), with millions dedicated specifically to descendant communities linked to the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 19th-century founders. The Herald also apologised in 2016 for the hurt and suffering caused by the publication of the names, addresses and professions of 53 people arrested during the 1978 Mardi Gras. The Nine journalist Brooke Boney, a Gamilaroi woman, wrote an accompanying piece about being a descendant of the Myall Creek massacre. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a feeling we have moved on from the massacres,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Today presenter said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But take any of the comments on social media posts about the situation in Alice Springs, or Stan Grant, Tony Armstrong or any time I post anything.

Those doom-laden Ministry of Works signs are making a comeback. Or a sort of comeback, as English Heritage announces plans for new signs that will have a more mindful spin. Instead of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beware open medieval culverts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, visitors might see a sign saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beware, this view will live long in the memory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The idea is to encourage visitors to explore sites with their five senses. That could be listening to the crunch of the gravel at Down House, the same sound Charles Darwin heard on his daily thinking walks. Or feeling the Northumberland wind pummelling your face on Hadrian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wall, as it would have for a Roman sentry 2,000 years ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a bit of a cliche but we do want people to get off their phones,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Samantha Stones, a senior properties curator for English Heritage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The signs are an encouragement for people to take a moment. Why not take your shoes off, feel the grass on your feet? Listen to the sounds of the birds singing. Smell the gorgeous Victorian garden around you. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be calm engagement \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you could take your shoes off and run around on the grass. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to evoke the same experiences some of the people who were there in the past would have had.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Ministry of Works signs, which have their own appreciation society, can still be found at heritage sites but not in the numbers they once were. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A lot of things tended to be forbidden, such as climbing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stones said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We wanted to take that Ministry of Works signage and have a playful interpretation to encourage our visitors to connect more deeply with the properties and the past.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At Mount Grace Priory, just off the busy A19 road in North Yorkshire, the site manager David Hannah thinks the signs are a great idea, although the terrible phone signal helps to keep people off their devices in any event. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fabulous, it adds to the peace and tranquility,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Mount Grace is home to the best-preserved Carthusian priory in England, where hermitic monks spent their days praying and working alone in silence. People today come to take in the scenery but all the senses can be stimulated, Hannah said. Mount Grace\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beware, this view will live long in the memory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign is well placed, pointing out a view up to the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manor house through the Chris Beardshaw-designed garden, a joyful blaze of pulmonaria, Brunnera macrophylla, Primula beesiana, ferns, hostas, foxgloves and acers up to a border of peonies and irises. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is quite something, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hannah said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a view that everyone wants to take a photograph of \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 really, very special.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsewhere, visitors are invited to walk barefoot over a lawn or smell fragrant roses that even in early June are looking bewilderingly beautiful. In addition to the signs at properties, English Heritage has created on its website a \u00e2\u20ac\u015350 ways to explore using your senses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd list. It includes: Sniffing out the animals at some sites, such as the donkeys at Carisbrooke Castle, the horses at Audley End and the Tamworth pigs at Boscobel House. Listening to the sounds of water in gardens, including one of the grandest fountains in Europe, the spectacular Perseus and Andromeda fountain at Witley Court. Feeling the cold of seawater by paddling or swimming as Queen Victoria and her family did at Osborne beach. Taste produce still grown in kitchen gardens, including asparagus, strawberries and potatoes. Look through the same windows at the same views that figures including Charles Darwin, the Duke of Wellington, Queen Victoria and Charles I did. The signs are in place until the end of July and are no more than suggestions, Stones said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re suggesting that people might want to engage a little more and perhaps have a deeper connection with the past,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just about reading information on a panel or looking on your phone.

Sanghera, a journalist and author whose bestselling book Empireland assessed how the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colonial territories still infect contemporary politics and discourse, said he had begun to dread holding book events here. Speaking to the Intelligence Squared podcast, Sanghera, who also explored the legacy of empire in a Channel 4 series, said he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more or less stopped doing events in Britain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because actually, the trolling online is \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so used to it, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really feel real.

And you know, when that happens, it always makes for a good event in the sense that other people stand up for me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it feels like the whole event matters. I sell out my books. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I mean, it probably makes my publisher happy. But it comes at a personal cost to me. I realised I started dreading the moment. I was waiting to be attacked. And I just stopped doing those events. And I just did international ones.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was, he added, much more rewarding to talk to school students rather than encounter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153imperially nostalgic adults who maybe had a very one-sided education\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at book events. Sanghera has previously criticised politicians for inflaming and oversimplifying discussions about UK history and on how to balance pride and acknowledgment of wrongdoing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example with legislation to specifically protect statues. Although other historians of empire such as William Dalrymple have said they do not receive the same abuse, Sanghera said he believed others faced even more: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do feel like black historians get it worse. And women, women of colour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c absolutely the worst.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the wider spread of culture wars in the UK, Sanghera said he was worried about a move to US-style polarisation, as exemplified by Florida under its Republican governor and presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis, whose tenure has seen numerous booked banned from schools. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I spoke to the historical associations gathering of many history teachers last week, and they are full of stories of parents coming, saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy are you teaching my children all this fake history about Enoch Powell, who was right?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What do you say to that as a teacher? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a survey out a few months ago showing that people going to libraries are saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy are you even stocking this book? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s woke nonsense.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 And in Florida, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got books being banned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I feel like whatever happens with the culture wars over there, eventually comes over here.

Settings range from the beige tonal palette of 70s northern England to the blazing hypercolour of the near future, but the preoccupations remain familiar: lives invaded, manipulated, transformed and (who knows?)maybe even enhanced by technology. Once again, the show has attracted some A-list talent: Salma Hayek Pinault, Michael Cera and Aaron Paul are among the stellar names involved. Netflix, from Thursday 15 June *** The Full Monty Writer Simon Beaufoy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1997 film caught the post-Thatcher, downtrodden-but-defiant zeitgeist.

Filmed at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles, Schumer gets plenty of mileage out of the disappointments of marital sex, the problems of baby naming and the pros and cons of chewable Viagra.

Filmed across 204 locations over four years, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a strong emphasis on movement in this series; the mass migrations of everything from crabs to whales feature heavily. Across land and sea, the animals are constantly in motion and there are bittersweet moments as their travels take them through zones compromised by human activity.

This Star Trek expansion (a prequel of sorts) takes a different approach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bright and breezy and a quip is never far away. That said, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some serious business in this second season as the crew look death in the eye in order to save a civilisation. However, the emphasis remains on exploration and the interpersonal relationships between Pike, Spock, Uhura and the rest of the gang.

Maybe not, but just hope you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet a real vampire on your way home.

He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an outsider, but when he runs into vampire Jaime Winston and learns that the undead aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just a costume, he acquires a potentially liberating third identity. Vampirism is a slightly clunky metaphor for other forms of cultural alienation, but Nik is a persuasively bumbling lead.

The latest of his working stag trips with his old pals Richard Hammond and James May sees them travelling through Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia in search of automotive curios and vigorous male bonding.

I am deep in rural Cheshire, roughly halfway between Crewe and Chester. The pub sits high on the Sandstone Ridge, a distinctive feature in an otherwise level landscape \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one that is being considered for an area of outstanding natural beauty status (AONB) by Natural England. The Sandstone Trail runs past the pub, on its way from the market town of Frodsham on the Mersey estuary south to Whitchurch in north Shropshire. Two of the trail\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most impressive castles are close to the pub, linked by a five-mile ramble from the door. I set off around midday along country lanes, past old ivy-covered barns and mossy walls sprouting ferns. A cobbled track takes me under a stone archway, flanked by silver birches and bronzed oaks, bright holly trees and conifers. Coming out of the woods, huge views appear ahead. I am looking eastwards now across gently sloping wintry fields to the village of Bunbury. A white disc on the misty horizon is Jodrell Bank. The Unesco-listed site has been scanning space since the 1950s and has what is still one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest radio telescopes. Its First Light Pavilion opened in summer 2022. I reflect it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where the Vogons arrived in the Hitchhiker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guide to the Galaxy. The walk goes on, under wide skies, through fields of red soil. The turreted pink gatehouse of Victorian Peckforton Castle (a Doctor Who location to continue the sci-fi theme) stands by the lane. Architect Anthony Salvin, who worked on historic buildings such as Windsor Castle and Alnwick Castle, designed this mock-medieval fantasy in the 1840s for landowner and Tory MP John Tollemache. Complete with arrow slits and arches, an octagonal library tower and an oak-panelled long gallery, Historic England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Grade I listing describes it as: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last serious fortified home built in England.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Leaving the road again, I walk past Peckforton Mere. This watery area is all that is left of a much larger area of mossland, drained for farming in the 1800s. Cheshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 60-odd mosses and meres are endangered habitats, supporting flowers like bog asphodel and dragonflies like the white-faced darter. Peckforton Mere has been restored to boggy glory; reed buntings and moorhens are busy in a fringe of flourishing sedge grass. Beyond the mere, the birch branches are studded with twiggy clumps known as witches\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 brooms while a nuthatch circles a smooth trunk nearby. Looking the other way, there are views of both Peckforton and the much older Beeston Castle, topping the wooded crag that rises improbably from a sea of fields and farm cottages. Lit by low golden light, it feels more like a Disney image of medieval countryside than something you might see on a walk in Cheshire. The Pennines and Wales are clearly visible on a good day from the fortified walls of Beeston Castle. Ranulf de Blondeville, sixth earl of Chester, built this formidable, status\u00e2\u20ac\u2018conscious fortress in the early 13th century, including banks and ditches from an iron age hillfort. Henry III took it over soon after and, centuries later, it was a royalist stronghold in the civil war. Beeston surrendered (and was partly destroyed) after the Battle of Rowton Heath in 1645, having reached the cat-eating stage of a long siege. The triumphant parliamentarians seized the castle to find \u00e2\u20ac\u0153neither meate, Ale nor Beere \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 save only a peece of Turkey pye, Twoe Bisketts, a lyve Peacock and a peahen\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Visitors today have more palatable options. English Heritage has an outdoor cafe and, a mile away, near the Shropshire Union Canal, the eco-friendly Lockgate Coffee House does breakfasts, brunches and luxurious home-baked cakes. Arriving in Beeston on a winter weekday, the castle and onsite cafe are shut, but I sit at one of the picnic tables near the impressive gateway and share my sandwich with a tame robin before following the Sandstone trail back towards the Pheasant. The trail, with its cheerful footprint waymarks, crams history, wildlife and swirling coral-pink sandstone into its mostly ridge-top 34 miles. As well as castles, there are churches, half-timbered cottages, iron age hillforts and legend-rich landmarks with names like Whistlebitch Well and Mad Allen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hole. The walls and rocks around Beeston Crag are hung with curtains of round green pennywort, sunny winter wallflowers and ivy-leaved toadflax. On the banks of a hollow way through the woods, the bright green stars of sphagnum moss spread like a miniature pine forest. The deep birdsong-rich peace is broken only by squawking pheasants. Peckforton Estate is prime pheasant territory and shooting season runs from October to February. Here in the quiet woods, the birds startle noisily out of the arching holly bushes or pick their way down the wooded slopes, their feathers matching perfectly the shining bronze and green of the old and new bracken. The pub is soon in sight, at the end of the lane. For a longer ramble, the pub has a leaflet that suggests three walks through the nearby countryside and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to combine this one with the three-mile-loop up Bulkeley Hill. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a smell of cooking towards late afternoon; some of the pheasants have wound up as crispy cordon bleu parcels. With a pint of locally brewed Pheasant Gold, they are an obvious choice. The evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s post-walk idyll closes with a cherry-pistachio frangipane tart and a tangy wild cherry sorbet from the farm down the road.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great contrast with today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upmarket inn, styling itself as a country retreat and foodie destination, gleaming with copper pans and horse brasses.

Outside, the original sandstone walls and half-timbering survive while the decor inside aims for classic contemporary: exposed stonework and muted tones. Newly renovated rooms in the big barn conversion have views across the Cheshire Plains and are named after local castles. Names of rooms in the creeper-covered stable wing favour forests and hills like Delamere and Rawhead, the highest point on the Sandstone Trail.

Recent downpours have turned the landscape green and produced enough grass for grazing animals. But they have come too late for 89-year-old Saku Shuna, who lies in an airless tent, cradled by her daughter Loko. Like the other 28,000 people in this camp for the displaced outside the town of Dubuluk, she was a herder who relied on cattle. She came here after thirst, hunger and disease claimed her herd a year ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My mother was a strong and vibrant woman,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Loko. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She walked everywhere and drank milk whenever she liked.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now Saku is so weak from hunger that she cannot sit up or even speak. She gets a few kilos of cornmeal a month as aid from an NGO, but it is too tough for her to digest. The only thing her stomach can handle is milk, but Loko has run out of money to buy it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel helpless,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Loko says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am just waiting for her to die.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The drought in the Horn of Africa is the worst in four decades. It could not have happened without the human-induced climate crisis, which has disrupted weather patterns and caused the failure of five consecutive rainy seasons, according to a recent study. Some 22 million people are at risk of starvation in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia. Older people such as Saku are among the most acutely affected. In Borena, half of those over 60 are malnourished. This is the highest rate ever recorded among old people in the area, according to HelpAge International, an NGO, and far above the local malnutrition rate of 19% among children. Yet there is little help for old people from aid agencies, which prioritise the targeting of children and mothers, says Samson Yigezu from HelpAge. The Ethiopian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drought response plan contains no measures for the elderly, for example. This is despite the fact that old people experiencing hunger need special interventions, such as nutrient-rich, easy-to-swallow food. This is sometimes distributed at the displacement camp where Saku lives, but only to mothers with young children. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The old people here are in a terrible condition,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Gondana Kanchora, a camp community leader. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are pastoralists who are used to drinking milk, but now their animals are dead. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have strong teeth and they cannot eat normal food given by the NGOs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd HelpAge International is the only organisation specifically helping old people hit by the drought in Borena. It works with local partners to distribute emergency supplies, cash and water to people over 60 and their families. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Older people are the group with the highest level of malnutrition,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Yigezu. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yet they are completely overlooked by everybody \u00e2\u20ac\u201c aid agencies, the government, even the community itself. It is a huge failure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some are trying to address this. Fitsum Degama, a local official, says he has raised the plight of old people in Borena with the government, but without success. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are forgotten,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Degama says. Putting old people at even greater risk in Borena is a local custom that says elders should not eat until the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s children are fed. Duba Galgalo, 78, explains that this practice is closely followed when times are lean. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the drought started, I always eat last,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Galgalo, who has 12 grandchildren. The family share one meal a day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there is nothing left after they have eaten, I will pass the evening without food. But at least I feel relieved that the children have eaten.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Old people are also vulnerable to exploitation during droughts. Sitting outside his tent in the camp and wrapped in a ragged white shawl, Kiro Godana, who is in his 90s, says he has seen many droughts but that this one is the worst. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the past, it might not get rainfall for one season. We might lose one to two cows and the others would survive. We had ways of coping. But this one is much longer. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why our cows didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t survive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Godana is partially deaf so questions have to be shouted loudly into his ear. He responds in a hoarse whisper. The toll malnutrition has taken on his body is clearly visible: his ribs protrude through his skin and weeping wounds run down his stick-thin legs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My life was normal and good when I had my cows,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everything changed when I lost them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Conditions are even tougher in the villages outside the camp, which are hard for aid agencies to reach. In Higo, a collection of grass and stick huts about an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drive away, all the young men have left in search of work, leaving behind children, women and the elderly. Boru Dido, who estimates he is 85, says the drought has left his family with nothing. He has little hope they will be able to replenish their livestock. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is good the rain has come back, but our animals are already dead,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no way of bringing them back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/china-plans-new-rules-to-regulate-file-sharing-services-like-airdrop-and-bluetooth", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "China plans new rules to regulate file sharing services like Airdrop and Bluetooth", "lead": "Under the proposal, service providers would have to prevent the dissemination of harmful and illegal information, save records and report their discoveries", "author": "Rachel Cheung in Hong Kong", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T05:56:59Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896869", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c9af79a8e6d0d4ca1d57e9d25a4dd28911a7f229/0_525_7868_4723/500.jpg", "body": "China is planning to restrict and scrutinise the use of wireless filesharing services between mobile devices, such as airdrop and Bluetooth, after they were used by protesters to evade censorship and spread protest messages.

Under the proposed rules, service providers would have to prevent the dissemination of harmful and illegal information, save relevant records and report their discovery to regulators. Service providers would also have to provide data and technical assistance to the relevant authorities, including internet regulators and the police, when they conduct inspections. Users must also register with their real names. In addition, features and technologies that have the capability to mobilise public opinion must undergo a security assessment before they could be introduced. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The new draft regulations would bring airdrop and similar services firmly into China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online content control apparatus,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tom Nunlist, a senior analyst at the consulting firm Trivium China, told the Guardian. Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Android and other Chinese phone manufacturers, such as Xiaomi and Oppo, also offer similar functions that are compatible among their own devices. But Apple, in particular, came under the spotlight after some Chinese protesters used airdrop in 2022 to bypass surveillance and circulate messages critical of the regime by sending them to strangers on public transport. The tool was a relatively untraceable method for sharing files in China, where most social media and messaging platforms are tightly monitored. Shortly later, Apple limited the use of airdrop on iPhones in China, allowing Chinese users to receive files from non-contacts for only ten minutes at a time. The proposed rules will take control of similar functions up a notch, requiring the receiving of files and preview of thumbnails to be disabled by default. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is mainly about cybersecurity, and the core aim is to ensure all the information transmission can be traced in case problematic things happen,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gao Fuping, a law professor at the East China University of Political Science and Law in Shanghai, told the South China Morning Post. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Apple has faced criticism in the past for its compliance practices in China,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nunlist, the senior analyst, added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Implementation of airdrop controls could easily lead to blowback at home in the US.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/first-edition-saudi-arabia-liv-golf-pga-tour", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Friday briefing: The next phase of Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsportswashing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 project?

First up, some breaking news: Donald Trump has been charged over his retention of national security documents and obstructing the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to retrieve them. Prosecutors have summoned the former president to surrender himself to authorities in Miami next Tuesday. The charges against Trump relate to alleged violations of the Espionage Act after classified documents were found at his Mar-a-Lago resort. More on that in the headlines \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 now on with our (somewhat fitting given the above) deep-dive topic for today. Some people find golf gripping. Others struggle to see the appeal of hitting a small ball as far as you can, and then walking a long way after it. And then there are some who find golf so appealing that they will spend many billions of dollars to own it outright. This week, Saudi Arabia bought professional golf. The shock establishment of a new body to run the US and European golf tours, solely funded by the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vast sovereign wealth fund and ultimately headed by a Saudi businessman, follows months of bitter division within the sport, but is unlikely to resolve the drama anytime soon. So why have they done it? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no reason for Saudi Arabia to have any interest in the sport of golf,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s golf correspondent Ewan Murray. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the word we all use \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sportswashing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Whether you are a fan of golf or couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell a mulligan from a divot, this matters, he says.

Five big stories US | Donald Trump just became the first former president in American history to face federal criminal charges, and he really might be going to jail, our Washington bureau chief, David Smith, has written overnight. Now that Trump has been criminally charged over his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of what the case is about and why it is significant. France | Four children and an adult have been injured in a knife attack in Annecy, in the French Alps. At least three were in a critical condition in hospital. A British national was among the children injured, the UK foreign secretary James Cleverly said. Health | NHS leaders have blamed staff shortages on huge waiting lists which have reached another record high. Some 7.4 million people in England are waiting to start treatment as of the end of April. One leader urged the government to speed up publication of its long-awaited workforce plan, which has been repeatedly postponed. Unions | The GMB union has reluctantly withdrawn its attempt to win formal union recognition at Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Coventry warehouse, after it did not gain enough new members to take it past the necessary threshold of support. The union has accused Amazon of drafting in more than 1,000 extra workers to skew the decision. UK news | The UK government has rejected a request by Royal Mail to end Saturday deliveries. The postal company has said that a six-day service is financially unsustainable, and is struggling after an annual loss of \u00c2\u00a31bn driven by postal worker strikes and the longer-run drop in profitability of letter deliveries. In depth: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe truth is, with bottomless pots of money, they can do what they like\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why is [Saudi Arabia] spending so much money, billions of dollars, recruiting players and chasing a concept with no possibility of a return?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jay Monahan, head of the PGA Tour, US golf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s organising body, asked last year. The answer was obvious, he implied: the country, which Monahan explicitly linked to 9/11, was obviously trying to distract everyone from its woeful human rights record by establishing LIV Golf, a new, breakaway league. Well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what do you know. On Tuesday, Monahan was revealed as the head of a new body which will oversee elite golf in the US and Europe, incorporating the PGA and European tours and LIV, with one sole investor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Public Investment Fund. Though Monahan is nominally the boss, he will answer to the Saudi chair of the fund, Yasir al-Rumayyan. The alphabet soup of golf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international governing bodies, and the intricacies of how they ran the sport, were of limited interest to non-obsessives until 2021, when the Saudi-backed LIV tour was launched. The country had been trying to get involved in the sport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainstream but were rebuffed, says Ewan, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so they said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcStuff you, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll set up our own thing.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Then they threw hundreds of millions of dollars at it, and took some of the best players in the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of the defectors, six-time major winner Phil Mickelson, acknowledged the Saudis were problematical masters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re scary motherfuckers to get involved with,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know they killed [Washington Post reporter Jamal] Khashoggi and have a horrible record on human rights. They execute people over there for being gay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And yet, he signed up anyway. His new bosses might not be nice but the money \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hundreds of millions of dollars in his case \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sure was. Defectors were expelled from the sport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mainstream, however, and for months the world of golf has been riven by acrimony, bitter litigation and fractured relationships. *** So how did this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deal happen? It certainly came as a shock, says Ewan, not least to Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods, the highest profile LIV refuseniks. The group of those in the know was kept so small, he says, that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153five or six people have reshaped the future of elite golf\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ultimately, he says, the established tours realised that given the Saudis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seemingly bottomless pockets, they could never hope to compete with them, and decided they had no alternative but to join them. Or as an understandably miffed McIlroy put it at a press conference in Canada, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Honestly I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just resigned myself to the fact that this is what is going to happen. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very hard to keep up with people that have more money than anyone else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd *** So what happens next? A deal might be in place but do not expect harmony on the manicured fairways just yet, says Ewan. From the technicalities of scheduling tournaments to the toxic subject of how defectors might be readmitted, the practicalities of how the two sides can be merged are far from clear. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There still has to be consequences to actions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said an otherwise phlegmatic McIlroy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The people who left the PGA Tour irreparably harmed this tour, started litigation against it. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just welcome them back in.

No doubt plenty more investment in sport. The country is already making significant inroads into football, buying Newcastle United in 2021, taking 75% control of the four biggest clubs in its home territory on Monday, and setting its sights on some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best players. Cristiano Ronaldo moved to the Saudi Pro League in January, and this week French stars Karim Benzema and N\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Golo Kant\u00c3\u00a9 have been persuaded to move there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Lionel Messi turned down Saudi overtures and this week signed with David Beckham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inter Miami.

It has won a place in the Formula One calendar, hosts major boxing bouts and wrestling events by the WWE \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and is even moving into esports. On Tuesday, Andy Murray said he fully expected Saudi Arabia to set its sights on tennis.

Cartoon of the day | Ben Jennings The Upside A bit of good news to remind you that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all bad After her relationship broke down in 2020 after a bad bout of Covid, Adelina joined a dating app where she met Alan, from nearby Milton Keynes. The pair exchanged messages for a few weeks, eventually agreeing to meet for a walk. There was an instant connection. They continued seeing each other through the rest of the year, going on more walks and even spending Christmas together. After Alan returned home though, Adelina began to feel extremely unwell again. As her symptoms progressively worsened she spent more and more time in and out of hospital - her doctor would eventually tell her that she had long Covid. Even though Alan and Adelina had only known each other for a month, Alan continued to visit regularly and after a while basically moved in to care for her. His kindness surprised Adelina - she had expected him to leave but Alan says he loved their time together, especially on Adelina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good days. Adelina has since gotten much better and recently proposed to Alan on a beach in France. The couple plan to move in together soon.

The US embassy in Canberra moved to clear up unanswered questions about the issue on Friday, insisting that the Australian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions to address the allegations had allayed any concerns. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Last week the chief of the Australian defence force, Gen Angus Campbell, revealed for the first time that the Brereton inquiry report had triggered discussions with the two countries, and that one army member\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment arrangements were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adjusted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help allay the US concerns. It prompted the Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie to claim that the US was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dictating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd what would happen to Australian personnel. The talks were triggered by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Leahy laws\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c provisions that ban the US from using funds to train units of foreign security forces \u00e2\u20ac\u0153where there is credible information implicating that unit in the commission of gross violations of human rights\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A US embassy spokesperson told Guardian Australia on Friday that defence and security ties between the two countries \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have been and continue to be exceptionally close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Following the release of the Afghanistan Inquiry Report of the Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force, the Australian government took action to address the allegations in the report,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the spokesperson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The US conducted a bilateral training review in accordance with US law and determined that no Leahy law restrictions are warranted for Australian security forces at this time. Funding for bilateral security cooperation was never suspended and training activities were not impacted by this review.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The embassy spokesperson pointed to continued cooperation between the two countries, including annual rotations of Marines to Darwin, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enhanced rotations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of US air force aircraft to Australia, and the Aukus partnership that also included the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our defence and security cooperation is essential for security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maj Gen Paul Brereton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four-year inquiry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose report was released in late 2020 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153credible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd information to implicate 25 current or former Australian special forces personnel in the alleged unlawful killing of 39 individuals and the cruel treatment of two others in Afghanistan. Last week Campbell told a Senate estimates hearing that he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153received a letter from the United States defence attach\u00c3\u00a9 here in Canberra\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in March 2021. Campbell recounted that the letter said the Brereton report \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may trigger Leahy law consideration with regard to the relationship between the United States armed forces and a partner unit or organisation, in this case either being Special Operations Command or the Special Air Service (SAS) regiment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Guardian Australia understands the then chief of the army, Lt Gen Rick Burr, subsequently wrote to a special forces member in February 2022 to say that while the person continued to serve in the special forces, there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no path\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to alleviate the concerns of the US. The person was informed that they would not be posted to support the SAS regiment or Special Operations Command, and would also not be able to join operations or exercises that involved the US. At the Senate committee, Campbell said he knew \u00e2\u20ac\u0153of one member of the army whose employment arrangements \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as in posted position \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was adjusted based on consideration of the question in part of whether Leahy law issues may emerge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said it was important to ensure \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there is no uncertainty about the continuing relationship between Australian and United States special forces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the change was made with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153due care\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153circumstances and opportunities and professional development\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The opposition is continuing to press Gallagher for an explanation of her evidence to Senate estimates, which has come under question due to the release of text messages between Higgins and her partner, David Sharaz, suggesting contact with Gallagher four days before the story broke. News of Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 allegation, which former staffer Bruce Lehrmann has vehemently denied, broke on 15 February 2021 in a news.com.au article and an interview aired later that evening on Channel 10\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Project. The initial trial was aborted last year due to jury misconduct and prosecutors dropped the charges against Lehrmann earlier this year amid concerns about the impact a second trial could have on Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mental health. In a heated exchange on 4 June 2021 under questioning from Gallagher and Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Penny Wong about her office\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of the alleged rape, the then minister for government services, Linda Reynolds, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know where this started.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked to explain, Reynolds said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was told by one of your senators two weeks before about what you were intending to do with the story in my office.

Gallagher said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one had any knowledge. How dare you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about protecting yourself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reynolds later told estimates that she had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very respectful discussion during the dinner break\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Wong and Gallagher \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve assured me they were not involved in that matter becoming public\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s angry and wants to help. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the context. Says they knew something was wrong because they fired Bruce and not you.

But medical organisations in the area are warning that the backlog means many cancer patients remain in limbo and some could die as a result. Sanjana Quazi, the head of the UN humanitarian affairs agency (Ocha) in Turkey, said cross-border referrals into Turkish hospitals officially resumed this week via Bab al-Hawa, the border crossing 50km west of Aleppo. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As of yesterday, the number of referrals has reached 80, comprising new and old cases,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Quazi said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are grateful to the government of Turkey and are very much encouraged by the resumption of cross-border referrals \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 because this will undoubtedly save lives.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At least 4,300 cancer patients are believed to be in north-west Syria, which is outside the control of the Syrian government and has no state services. Cancer care was already eroded before February\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earthquake, according to Relief International (RI) and the Syrian American Medical Society (Sams), who have staff in the area. A jointly authored report by the organisations published in May, highlighted the plight of patients in the region where up to 3,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed annually with just three oncologists for a population of 4.1 million. Dr Ahmad Hijjo, working for Relief International at the Binnish hospital near Idlib, said that the protracted conflict has taken its toll. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are living in extreme poverty and the priority for most is simply surviving one day to the next. This, coupled with Syria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crippled healthcare system, means that by the time people attend a checkup, it is more likely their illness has progressed and requires advanced treatment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that some surgeries are available through NGOs but not radiotherapy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A cancer diagnosis can already be extremely difficult to deal with, and the fact that patients are facing huge barriers to treatment on top of this is heartbreaking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hijjo said the cost of travel prevented many patients going back to Turkey for follow-up assessments. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They should be able to access the healthcare and cancer treatment they need free of charge inside north-west Syria,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Jamil Eddebel, an oncologist working at Sams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Idlib centre, said a lack of drugs was leading to scams where fake medications are being sold by criminals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, such medications are not available at our centres, and the majority of patients cannot afford to purchase them independently,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To make matters worse, being in a conflict zone means there is no effective supervision over imported drugs. This has led to the proliferation of fake oncology medicines on the black market, exploiting the desperation of patients who are in urgent need of legitimate treatment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Half of all health facilities in Syria have been destroyed or damaged since the war began and many specialised medical personnel have left. Only 35 oncologists remain in the country. Many Syrians have, the report said, adopted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative coping mechanisms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such as smoking and substance abuse, increasing the risk of cancers. Alifet Aref Shaar, 36, a mother of four from Idlib, developed breast cancer during her pregnancy. Doctors at the Sams centre began chemotherapy followed by surgery, but she was referred to Turkey for radiotherapy. It took seven months before she could get there, and then treatment was suspended. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately during that time, another mass appeared, and I was devastated to learn that the cancer had spread to my bones. Although the treatment eventually started, it has now been suspended due to the earthquake,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every time I have to travel for treatment, my children are left crying until I am back. The emotional and psychological toll on me is so hard. We are burdened with over $10,000 of debt due to the treatment costs, and now I am required to pay $400 every 21 days for three different immune medications. I really wish we had access to this therapy here in Syria, and to keep close to my family and children. The cost is way over our ability to afford.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Quazi said 90% of the people in north-west Syria rely on aid, but the UN 2023 humanitarian response plan, which has asked for $5.4bn, is only 11% funded. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All have been affected by the earthquakes in some way. Nearly a third of all health facilities in north-west Syria are reportedly non-functional.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/russian-armed-forces-infighting-yevgeny-prigozhin", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "As Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armed forces fight among themselves, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to know who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in control | Samantha de Bendern", "lead": "Yevgeny Prigozhin has launched another diatribe against the Russian army.

It was his most explosive yet. Dressed in a khaki sweatshirt and trousers, in the middle of a forest in a Wagner training camp, Prigozhin, the commander of an army of contract fighters known as the Wagner group, accuses the Russian army of lying about events in the Belgorod region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where anti-Putin Russian partisans have been conducting cross-border raids from Ukraine since late May \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and warns of the risk of civil war. He calls for the Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu to be put on trial for facilitating \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the genocide of the Russian population\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by being totally unprepared for the war in Ukraine, and more than once suggests that Shoigu and other senior military command should be shot. Prigozhin also claims that inhabitants of the Belgorod region have been writing to him, suggesting a Chile-type solution. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Chile means Pinochet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains Prigozhin. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Russian elite in a stadium surrounded by armed men with machine guns.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prigozhin even plays the nuclear card, initially saying that it would be counterproductive to use it now and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the button should have been pressed earlier \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 even though it would have been the act of a fucked-up psychopath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Later in the interview he suggests that Russians would be capable of using a nuclear weapon on their own territory. This comes with the comforting caveat that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unsure how well nuclear weapons would work if they are as badly maintained as the rest of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaponry. Th\u011e\u00b5 hour-long interview follows Prigozhin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tour of Russian cities during which he spoke of the need to open a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153second front\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in the information sphere, to tell the population the truth about what is happening on the front lines and recommended the creation of a territorial army specifically to protect Russia. Even though he denies having any political ambitions, all these elements together look very much like a politician preparing either for an electoral campaign or an armed coup. The question remains whether Prigozhin is controlled by the Kremlin, or is a loose cannon posing a serious threat to the regime. Since in Russia nothing is ever as it seems, this either/or question is probably far too simple. Some things however seem clearer than others. Prigozhin would not be able to travel around Russia holding court without support and protection at the highest level. Moreover, as he vilifies what he calls the corrupt elites and calls with impunity for them to be executed, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most famous anti-corruption campaigner, Alexei Navalny, is rotting away in a penal colony and faces a potential 30-year prison sentence. Those with protection in the right places can say what they want. After taking Bakhmut, Prigozhin decided to withdraw his forces, leaving the regular Russian army to hold the city. Was he allowed to do this in the knowledge that Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip on Bakhmut was threatened by the Ukrainian armed forces who have regained control of parts of the surrounding countryside? If in the coming weeks the Russians lose the city, the regular army will be blamed, and Prigozhin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bakhmut victory will be intact. Again, this points to patronage at the highest level allowing him to save face. By suggesting the creation of a territorial defence and opening what he calls his second Wagner front domestically, Prigozhin appears to be positioning himself to play a mix of policing, security and information/propaganda roles inside Russia. This is vastly different from being a proxy foreign policy tool and private army operating abroad, particularly considering that Wagner, like most other private military companies (apart from those created to protect critical infrastructure), is still officially illegal. Without high-up support it seems hard to imagine how long this ambition will go unchallenged. Another thing that is becoming clearer is intra-Russian chaos and animosity, if not outright armed conflict. In the last week, Wagner forces detained an officer of the Russian federal army whom they accused of mining their retreat and shooting at them while drunk; anti-Putin Russian partisans captured Russian regular forces and invited the governor of the Belgorod region to negotiate their freedom; and a high-ranking Chechen fighter openly criticised Yevgeny Prigozhin, highlighting the rivalry between the Chechen forces and Wagner. Without counting the mounting jealousies between the growing number of Russian private armies, the above describes at least four factions of armed Russians (including one fighting on the Ukrainian side) in conflict with each other. If one accepts that Prigozhin is protected by the Kremlin, to what extent does the Kremlin actually mean Putin? So far Prigozhin has refrained from direct attacks on the president and has even said that he respects him. However, by mocking Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear decision-making and capabilities in his recent harangue, he appears to be undermining the very concept of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear deterrent. It is hard not to see this as a criticism of Putin who is the ultimate arbiter of nuclear use. Double, triple bluff? Prigozhin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest rant looks more and more like the tip of an iceberg that betrays growing fractures inside Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top power structure. In a country that cannot even defend a small sliver of its border from incursions and allows drones to hit the centre of power, it is difficult to imagine a master in the Kremlin who has the absolute control, foresight and planning capacity necessary to manage all this chaos and pull Prigozhin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s puppet strings. In February 2022, two days before the invasion of Ukraine, senior members of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security council cowered in submission before a seemingly omnipotent Putin. As the war grinds on, these same men may be the ones planning to take control from a president who seems increasingly divorced from the realities of the front line. They will need a scapegoat for the disastrous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special military operation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With his frequent diatribes against the regular army, Prigozhin is handing them the heads of the Russian armed forces on a plate. Perhaps he is also promising to be their front man and guarantor of immunity as he helps navigate the chaos to come. Whether or not this includes Putin is anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guess.

With almost one in five pupils aged seven to 16 now thought to have a mental health disorder, specialist support teams were set up to work with children in schools, addressing early symptoms and reducing pressure on overstretched NHS services. According to new figures shared exclusively with the Guardian, however, pupils in almost three-quarters (73.4%) of primary schools in England will have had no access to the new mental health support teams (MHSTs) by the end of 2024. Older pupils fare slightly better, with MHSTs expected to be in place in about half (53.5%) of secondary schools by the end of 2024, according to figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats. The government is yet to confirm future funding plans. The research follows reports that a quarter of a million children in the UK with mental health problems have been denied help by the NHS, with some trusts failing to offer treatment to 60% of those referred by GPs. The former children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commissioner for England Anne Longfield said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These shocking figures show the scale of the crisis in unmet mental health need that our children are now facing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Poor mental health, self-harm and in some cases suicide attempts have become part and parcel of growing up for many children, yet children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental health services are unable to meet the overwhelming demand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd MHSTs were widely welcomed when first announced by the government in 2018, promising early intervention in a school-based setting for children aged five to 18 with mild to moderate mental health problems, before they develop into a crisis. School leaders say the MHSTS are having a positive effect, but the rollout has not gone fast enough or far enough, leaving tens of thousands of children without adequate support either in school or from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). There are also concerns that the teams are struggling to meet the needs of children with more complex conditions, who do not reach the high threshold set for a CAMHS referral but need more support than MHSTs can offer. The Lib Dems sent freedom of information requests to every NHS integrated care board (ICB) in England, asking for details about MHSTs already operating in their area, or due to be operational by the end of 2024. Thirty-one of the 42 ICBs responded with data. The responses revealed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a huge postcode lottery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the rollout and wide geographical variation in spending per pupil on MHSTs, ranging from \u00c2\u00a387 in the area covered by NHS Surrey Heartlands ICB, down to \u00c2\u00a324 in North East and North Cumbria ICB and \u00c2\u00a334 in Hertfordshire and West Essex. The Liberal Democrats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is letting down our children and young people. Our children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental health services were in crisis before the pandemic, but Conservative ministers have failed completely to grasp the scale of the tidal wave in mental ill health that has emerged since. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under the Tories, a school that sees an NHS mental health professional for a day a week is one of the lucky ones. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of children are left waiting to see if mental health support will be rolled out at their school or sacrificed to pay for the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic incompetence. Yet failing to roll out the programme will simply make waiting times for acute CAMHS even worse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In some areas, the Lib Dem data shows, MHSTs do not cover secondary schools at all. Data for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly show that the MHSTs cover only primary schools, with a remit to prioritise pupils \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in reception year and [in] the transition into year 7\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but even then only 47% of primary schools in the area are covered. Surrey Heartlands ICB, which covers most of the county, operates MHSTs in four out of 10 secondary schools but in fewer than one in 10 primaries. Four more MHSTs are due to become operational by the end of next year. The Lib Dems say Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and West Berkshire ICB have seen the slowest rollouts, with existing or planned teams covering just one in five secondary schools and one in 10 primaries. According to the government, the rollout of MHSTs is ahead of schedule, and it has promised to increase the number from nearly 400 in April 2023, covering 35% of pupils and learners in England, to more than 500 covering about 44% by the same time next year. Barnardo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which delivers 12 MHSTs across England, launched a petition earlier this year calling on the government to roll out MHSTs to cover every school and college throughout England. The charity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior policy adviser, Becky Rice, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Children of all ages across both primary and secondary schools are struggling with their mental health \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just something which is impacting those in their teenage years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to ensure children of all ages struggling with issues such as low mood, anxiety or emotional regulation get the help and support to manage so they are able to happily progress through the rest of their childhood years without reaching crisis point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Schools are dealing with growing numbers of children with special educational needs. Government data published on Thursday showed that the number of children with education, health and care plans in 2023 rose to 517,000, 9% more than last year. Margaret Mulholland, a special needs and inclusion specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a growing mental health crisis among children and young people. MHSTs can have a really positive impact in tackling this, but not all schools are currently able to access these services. The scheme must be rolled out to all parts of the country as soon as possible to ensure all children and young people are able to benefit from it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A government spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These teams represent just one of the ways we are supporting schoolchildren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental health, and come on top of our annual \u00c2\u00a32.3bn investment into mental health services. This means an additional 345,000 children and young people will be able to access the NHS-funded mental health support they need.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt is an ongoing challenge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hannah Savory works for Barnardo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental health support teams in schools across Swindon \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a challenging, diverse and rewarding role, but an increasing number of children need support. The first quarter of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s referrals are up by 185% compared with 2021. I see the positive difference mental health support teams are making and I just wish there were more teams like us throughout the country to meet the level of need. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My day starts with a session with a 14-year-old boy. When I first met him, he was feeling very low \u00e2\u20ac\u201c withdrawing from school, hobbies and friends. We have spent our sessions together building up his motivation and reintroducing activities back into his routine that will support his mental health. As he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s talking to me, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen the light come back on in his eyes. He describes a time with his friends and the joy it made him feel. This moment makes me so grateful for the role I have with Barnardo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without these sessions, he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in the good place he is now. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My next session is with a girl in year 11 experiencing anxiety. Her GCSEs have started, and she tells me her panic attacks have increased. She says she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is something that unfortunately a lot of young people can relate to. We use the session to challenge these thoughts and practise mindfulness exercises, so she can go into her exams feeling calmer and more confident. When our sessions end, I know she is someone who would benefit from further specialist counselling for low self-esteem. Barnardo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is calling for an MHST+ model which will include a school counsellor to help children with more specific needs, which would be a dream to have for children like her. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My role includes working closely with teachers, so, in the afternoon, I am training staff on how they can support students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mental health. As a mental health professional, I can help school staff to offer more effective support to promote the wellbeing of their students. They tell me the session leaves them with a better understanding of mental health and some good practical strategies. We all agree that children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s academic success must be built on a strong sense of wellbeing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My day finishes with a meeting to discuss waiting list management. Our service has seen a huge increase in demand and it is an ongoing challenge for me and the team to make sure children and young people get help in a timely manner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/09/country-diary-far-from-roar-of-the-tt-i-find-wildlife-bliss", "primaryCategory": "environment", "title": "Country diary: Far from roar of the TT, I find wildlife bliss | David Bellamy", "lead": "<strong>Lezayre, Isle of Man:</strong> The island is bursting into life \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least here, on this farm, which is reaping the rewards of traditional haymaking", "author": "David Bellamy", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T04:30:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896898", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ae9eb20c2328398ba6941fe799fcd044aeb22c36/0_209_4032_2418/500.jpg", "body": "It is hard to escape the noise of the TT festival. On a small, quiet island the sudden arrival of tens of thousands of visitors on their motorbikes is a shock to the system. Many residents look forward to June when the island bursts into life. The pubs probably make more in a fortnight than the rest of the year. But many islanders loathe the chaos and inconvenience. This is the only time you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll find yourself in a Manx traffic jam. Having no interest in the bikes myself, the TT means something altogether different, for it coincides with one of the greatest wildlife phenomena to be found in the British Isles: the flowering of our traditional hay meadows. Haymaking is among the most ancient forms of agriculture. Dry grass cut in late summer will preserve itself and get a flock or herd through the winter. Crucially, this late cut, compared with spring-cut silage, which is preserved in plastic wrap, also allows birds to raise their chicks and plants to flower and set seed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c resulting in wildlife bliss. Undertaking some TT escapism, my refuge is a most wondrous meadow. Among a sea of thousands of flowers are five species of orchid, including the rare greater butterfly orchid, which can only truly be appreciated by lying down on your belly. It is among the most striking of all the 500 or so plant species that call our island home. Any meadow hosting them should be worshipped. Upliftingly, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not on a nature reserve. This is an ordinary farm with an extraordinary farmer. Long ago, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need nature reserves when so much farmland looked like this. My refuge is interrupted by the monotonous throb of a helicopter, signifying that the race leader is approaching. The course is a mile away, yet the clamour of roaring bikes is undiminished. Peace does not return until they have beasted their way up over the mountain. The din subsides, yet the meadow is still alive with a frenzy of butterflies, hoverflies, bees. A hay meadow in June is a microcosm of the island during TT; beautiful yet chaotic. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Country diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2023/jun/08/trump-indicted-mar-a-lago-documents-updates-live", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Trump indicted over alleged retention of documents at Mar-a-Lago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "This blog is closed", "author": "Tess McClure (now) and Gabrielle Canon (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T04:28:29Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896901", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f627096eb8908ca59944f5e71ec8218da1b5eb44/0_195_3900_2340/500.jpg", "body": "It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now just after midnight in New Jersey, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wrapping our live coverage of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indictment. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where things stand: Trump was criminally indicted after federal prosecutors spent more than a year investigating whether he illegally retained classified documents at his home in Mar-a-Lago and intentionally misled federal officials in an attempt to keep them. The investigation is headed by special counsel Jack Smith, a former chief prosecutor of the Hague, who was charged with both this probe and a separate one focused on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement in the January 6 attack. These charges only reflect the results of the first investigation. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer Jim Trusty has said the summons refers to around seven charges which broadly fall under the Espionage Act, and include false statements, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and illegally retaining classified documents. The former president will appear in person on Tuesday at the courtroom to meet the indictment, his lawyers said. The problem began back in May 2021, when the National Archives and Records Administration began requesting missing documents from the former president. After some initial pushback, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorneys returned 15 boxes of records that included classified documents. After the Trump team told federal investigators that all classified materials had been returned, the FBI conducted a raid on Mar-a-Lago last August and found more than 100 documents. Included in the evidence is a recording of Trump where he talks about a classified document in his possession. This is important because it refutes his claim that he declassified the materials in his possession while he was president. Trump continues to insist the investigation and resulting indictment are politically motivated and has used the charges to rally his base and rake in fundraising dollars for his campaign to retake the White House. But some polls show non-Republican voters aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as easily convinced. Political allies have voiced their support, with US House speaker Kevin McCarthy promising to use his position to come to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defense. Calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the country, the top Republican in the House tweeted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House Republicans will hold this brazen weaponization of power accountable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd You can continue to follow The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coverage and analysis of the indictment and Donald Trump here. While the indictment is historic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marking the first time a former president will face criminal charges \u00e2\u20ac\u201c neither the indictment itself nor a conviction would prevent Trump from running for or winning the presidency in 2024. Polling has also shown that the indictment is unlikely to turn his existing supporters off \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and may even galvanise their support. Surveyed in a USA Today/Suffolk poll in April, two-thirds of his supporters said an indictment would not make a difference to their view of Trump. Almost all of the remaining third said the indictments would make them more likely to support him, not less likely: 27% compared to 4%. According to Pew Research surveying conducted last year, just 7% of Republican supporters say investigations into Donald Trump and his administration are very important to their vote in the coming election. Within 20 minutes of his announcement that he had been indicted, Trump began fundraising off it for his 2024 presidential campaign. The former president sent out an email to supporters immediately after his announcement on Thursday afternoon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Biden-appointed Special Counsel has INDICTED me in yet another witch hunt regarding documents that I had the RIGHT to declassify as President of the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said, and asked supporters to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please make a contribution to peacefully stand with me today and prove that YOU will NEVER surrender our country to the radical Left \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for 1,500% impact.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Californian congressman Ted Lieu has hit back at House speaker Kevin McCarthy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments, saying he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intentionally misleading the public\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by implying the indictment had been issued by Presiden Biden. Donald Trump will attend the summons personally on Tuesday, his lawyers say. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gonna show up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said lawyer Jim Trusty, speaking to CNN on Thursday evening. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disappointed that this is where we are as a country and this is where the Department of Justice is, but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not - you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to see him, you know, hide in Scotland.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trusty would not confirm which members of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal team would be present at the hearing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there have been months of distrust and turmoil among the lawyers representing the former president. Correspondent Hugo Lowell has an exclusive report on that here: Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer Jim Trusty has said the charges fall under the Espionage Act, and include false statements, obstruction of justice, and illegally retaining classified documents. Speaking to CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kaitlan Collins on Thursday night, Trusty said Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorneys received a summons via email from the Justice Department on Thursday listing the charges, but haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seen the indictment yet. Trusty said that because the document was a summons rather than an indictment, the number of charges was not entirely clear, but there appeared to be seven, all broadly falling under the Espionage Act. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It does have some language in it that suggests what the seven charges would be. [It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] not 100% clear that all of those are separate charges, but they basically break out from an Espionage Act charge,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, and said those included several obstruction-based charges, false statement charges, and a potential conspiracy charge. Trusty said he expects to see the indictment between now and Tuesday, and had been summoned to appear at the courthouse at three o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock on Tuesday. We will continue to bring you the latest on the federal criminal charges brought against former president Donald Trump. But for now, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of where things stand: Trump was criminally indicted after federal prosecutors spent more than a year investigating whether he illegally retained classified documents at his home in Mar-a-Lago and intentionally misled federal officials in an attempt to keep them. The investigation is headed by special counsel Jack Smith, a former chief prosecutor of the Hague, who was charged with both this probe and a separate one focused on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s involvement in the January 6 attack. These charges only reflect the results of the first investigation.

After some initial pushback, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorneys returned 15 boxes of records that included classified documents. After the Trump team told federal investigators that all classified materials had been returned, the FBI conducted a raid on Mar-a-Lago last August and found more than 100 documents. Included in the evidence is a recording of Trump where he talks about a classified document in his possession. This is important because it refutes his claim that he declassified the materials in his possession while he was president. Trump continues to insist the investigation and resulting indictment are politically motivated and has used the charges to rally his base and rake in fundraising dollars for his campaign to retake the White House. But some polls show non-Republican voters aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as easily convinced. You can continue to follow our ongoing coverage and analysis here. Governor Ron DeSantis, a GOP presidential hopeful and key Trump challenger for the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nomination, has responded in support of the former president, saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the weaponization of federal law enforcement represents a mortal threat to a free society\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a tweet he repeated sentiments shared by other top Republicans, insisting the charges were politically motivated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have for years witnessed an uneven application of the law depending upon political affiliation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, before bringing focus back to his campaign. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The DeSantis administration will bring accountability to the DOJ, excise political bias and end weaponization once and for all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not alone. Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican entrepreneur hoping to be the next president, also voiced his support for Trump and promised him a pardon should the Ramaswamy campaign succeed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be much easier for me to win this election if Trump weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the race, but I stand for principles over politics,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I commit to pardon Trump promptly on January 20, 2025, and to restore the rule of law in our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US House speaker Kevin McCarthy has promised to use his position to come to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defense, echoing the former president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims that the indictment was politically motivated. Calling it a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the country, the top Republican in the House tweeted, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is unconscionable for a President to indict the leading candidate opposing him\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Claiming that Biden also kept classified documents, he added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House Republicans will hold this brazen weaponization of power accountable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Not all Republicans agree with the characterization, however. Former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, who is challenging Trump for the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential nomination, called on him to end his campaign. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from his willful disregard for the constitution to his disrespect for the rule of law \u00e2\u20ac\u201c should not define our nation or the Republican party,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a sad day for our country.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steel agreed, rebutting the claims that Trump is being targeted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Remember: he is in this position because of his own actions; there was no \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwitch-hunt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122; a federal judge ruled there was probable cause Trump committed a crime.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Steele tweeted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153HE owns this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The charges have done little to slow the Trump campaign down. Reportedly emboldened by the indictment, he is still planning to go ahead with campaign stops in Georgia and North Carolina this weekend and will likely use the charges to rally his base around him. CNN reports someone close to the team said that he and his advisers are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very jacked up right now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ready to fight back\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But even if they can frame the charges in an advantageous way for supporters, significant challenges remain. More from CNN: Despite possibly giving Trump a boost in polls and fundraising that could help him in the Republican primary, several top advisers know the risk associated with a federal indictment and believe it will hurt Trump in the long term. Trump and his team had been bracing for a potential indictment in the investigation into his handling of classified documents. However, many of them were shocked to learn of the actual indictment earlier tonight. Multiple sources told CNN they are still trying to figure out what exactly the charges are.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The charges are historic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marking the first time a former president has been indicted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but also come as he remains a Republican frontrunner in his bid to retake the White House. His base is expected to rally around him and already Republican supporters have echoed his claims that the investigation is politically motivated. Texas congressman Troy Nehls tweeted Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Truth Social post stating, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Trump has been indicted. We live in a Banana Republic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Senator Chuck Grassley and congressman Wesley Hunt both tied the news to unproven allegations that Biden was involved in a foreign bribery scheme. (NBC reports Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response about the document was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bunch of malarkey.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) But according to a Yahoo-YouGov poll taken late last month, non-Republican voters think the allegations against Trump are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The poll reports that 66% of registered voters expressed that view. Meanwhile, only 42% of registered Republicans called the crime serious. The news also altered some American perceptions of the former president, with 34% responding that the allegations caused them to view him more negatively, with 43% saying their view did not change. The justice department investigation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c launched in 2022 after the National Archives discovered classified materials in 15 boxes of documents Trump wrongfully kept after he left office \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has focused on three statutes under title 18 of the US criminal code: willful retention of national defense information, obstruction of justice and the retention of government documents. Prosecutors also looked into whether Trump showed others classified national security materials that were found in his Mar-a-Lago office. My colleague Hugo Lowell reports: The investigation into the obstruction, meanwhile, has focused on whether the failure by Trump to fully comply with the subpoena last year was a deliberate act of obstruction because he wanted to retain the classified documents even after he had left office, the people said. Last June, the since-recused Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran found 38 classified documents in the storage room at Mar-a-Lago and told the justice department that no further materials remained there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which came into question when the FBI seized 101 more classified documents months later. Corcoran later told associates he felt misled because he had asked whether he should search elsewhere at Mar-a-Lago, such as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, but was waved off, the Guardian first reported. Corcoran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notes also showed he told Trump he had to return all classified documents in his possession. The White House has not issued a statement or commented on the indictment, aside from emphasizing that the justice department investigation is independent and not reporting to the Biden administration. One official told CNN that the president learned of the charges along with the public from this evening\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news coverage. In a 4-minute video posted to Truth Social, Trump argued that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innocent and that this is a politically motivated attack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a rallying cry he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s used through the years to bolster his base and deny the many accusations made against him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an innocent man. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an innocent person,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, calling the investigation \u00e2\u20ac\u0153election interference at the highest level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He used the video to frame his presidency in a favorable light before saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our country is going to hell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a failing nation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And this is what they do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of background on the case and what we know so far: Trump shared the news on Truth Social, telling his followers that he must appear at the federal courthouse in Miami on Tuesday. This is the first time the former president has been charged with federal criminal charges by the justice department, but are only one part of his mounting legal troubles. He was also indicted by a Manhattan grand jury in March, faces state criminal charges in New York and is being investigated by the district attorney in Fulton county, Georgia, over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. The justice department inquiry, headed by special counsel Jack Smith, has been investigating whether Trump illegally handled documents and this indictment signifies their case is a strong one. As my colleague Sam Levine points out: The justice department is generally extremely careful when they choose to bring cases and so the fact that prosecutors felt confident enough to indict Trump, knowing the political maelstrom that would result, is a signal of the strength of the case against him. Among the evidence against Trump is a 2021 recording, where he can be heard discussing one of the classified documents.

Before visiting the flood-affected areas on Thursday, he used his nightly address to say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Large-scale efforts are needed. We need international organisations, such as the International Committee on Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help the people in the occupied part of Kherson region. Each person that dies there is a verdict on the existing international architecture and international organisations that have forgotten how to save lives. If there is no international organisation in the area of this disaster now, it means it does not exist at all and that it is incapable of functioning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He told the German newspaper Der Bild that the UN and the ICRC \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are not there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His remarks reflect his anger that the UN \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and much international reporting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not yet rebutting Russian claims of innocence over the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destruction, or focusing on the Russian failure to help those on the occupied left bank to which the UN and the ICRC says they have been denied access by Moscow. But his criticism is only his latest salvo in his savaging of the performance of the ICRC in Ukraine, as opposed to Red Cross Ukraine. Zelenskiy and his circle believe the Geneva-based organisation has used the cover of neutrality, international law and confidentiality to mask a moral weakness. Dmytro Lubinets, the Ukrainian ombudsman for human rights, said last month that every day he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153faced with the fact that the Red Cross does not want to perform its functions. But worst of all, the Red Cross has a monopoly and does not allow other organisations to appear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One organisation uses its history its name to get in the way of doing something impactful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lubinets added Ukraine wanted a second organisation to be established with co-responsibility for accessing political prisoners, arguing that competition might spur the ICRC to be more proactive. One bone of contention has been the ICRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to combatants. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s anger was sparked by the ICRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to access Olenivka, a notorious camp in eastern Ukraine where dozens of Ukrainian PoWs died in an explosion and fire in July. In his nightly address on 13 October, Zelenskiy said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe the International Committee of the Red Cross is not a club with privileges where one receives a salary and enjoys life. The Red Cross has obligations, primarily of a moral nature. The mandate of the Red Cross must be fulfilled.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The following month, apparently fed up with the perceived inaction, the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office announced the creation of a human rights information staff, saying the ICRC seemed incapable of calling out, or investigating, Russian human rights abuses. In his address later that month to the G20 in Bali, Zelenskiy let rip again, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u015311,000 children [who were forcibly deported to Russia], hundreds of thousands of deported adults, and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we have not found support in the International Committee of the Red Cross. We do not see that they are fully fighting for access to the camps where Ukrainian prisoners and political prisoners are held, or that they are helping to find deported Ukrainians.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy questioned whether the ICRC could any longer claim the legal and moral right to be the upholders of international humanitarian law: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And such self-elimination is the self-destruction of the Red Cross as an organisation that was once respected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd By contrast, Zelenskiy has expressed admiration for the more pugnacious style of Rafael Grossi, the director of the UN International Atomic Energy Agency, which has visited both Russia and Ukraine to uphold safety at the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. The natural style of the relatively new head of the ICRC, a former Swiss diplomat, Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, is one of discretion. She says the mandate of the ICRC means that it is not an advocacy group or a body capable of mounting inquiries. Faced by a world in which the post-1945 respect for an agreed rules-based order has eroded, she cannot unilaterally enter prison camps or order cooperation from the countries with which she has to deal. Accumulated trust, neutrality and confidentiality are critical components of success for the ICRC, she believes. She has 1,000 staff in Ukraine, and recently said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The closer you come to the front line, the more people know how important neutrality is because it protects you. We have very little means of assuring safety and security for our staff other than our strict 160-year-old neutrality and impartiality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She is also facing budget cuts. The ICRC recently announced that it would have to cut 1,800 jobs to save $440m (\u00c2\u00a3350m) from its $3.2bn budget. Efforts were clearly under way on Thursday to patch up relations with meetings between UN and Ukrainian officials in Kherson. The Ukrainian Red Cross was also stressing that it was active on the ground. The ICRC rejected the criticism saying the response from the Ukraine Red Cross \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was immediate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and its teams had already evacuated hundreds of people. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ICRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primary focus is on access to water. Our experts work with the National Red Cross Society and local authorities, and we will supply goods and equipment over the coming days,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a statement said. The organisation added its work with political prisoners had given more than 5,500 families on both sides news of their loved ones since February 202. In a statement, UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s humanitarian body said it had organised water trucking and delivered more than 100,000 bottles of drinking water, water purification tablets and jerrycans to affected communities in the Kherson region. The UN coordinator on humanitarian affairs, Martin Griffiths, a hugely experienced British diplomat, insists his teams are already active on the ground, and he was working to gain access to Russian-controlled areas."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/09/childrens-commissioner-england-crackdown-vape-marketing", "primaryCategory": "society", "title": "Ministers urged to restrict marketing of vapes to children in England", "lead": "Rachel de Souza points to research showing evidence about pressure to vape and its subsequent effects", "author": "Rachel Hall", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T04:00:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896907", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7ff90f83f65363bf2ba0fd339208f3498f8904c1/0_194_8032_4821/500.jpg", "body": "The children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commissioner for England has urged ministers to crack down on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153insidious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd marketing of vapes to young people, which is leaving them so addicted to nicotine they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t concentrate on lessons. Rachel de Souza said the government would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failing a generation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153highly addictive and sometimes dangerous products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were allowed to become mainstream. Her comments are underpinned by research into the experiences of 3,500 young people across the UK, which found \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply worrying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd evidence that children feel pressured to vape, with addictions preventing some from concentrating for whole lessons, while others are avoiding school toilets for fear of peer pressure to vape. The findings have spurred De Souza to call for the government to ban disposable vapes, which are popular among children, and for regulation to mirror that of tobacco, including plain packaging and age-of-sale signage. She also called for a ban on nicotine-free vapes, which are seen as a gateway to vapes with nicotine. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We urgently need stricter regulation of this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwild west\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 market. It is insidious that these products are intentionally marketed and promoted to children, both online and offline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many children who are addicted to vaping have never even smoked tobacco, with vaping acting as a gateway rather than a quitting strategy. Children deserve to lead long, happy, healthy lives, which is why I am unequivocal in my view that no child should be smoking or vaping.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The research found that children and parents wanted more information about vaping\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harms and tighter regulation. De Souza said school leaders had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153horrified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to find that vapes confiscated from students contained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerously high levels of chemicals like nickel and lead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, exposure to which can affect the central nervous system and brain development. While she welcomed the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent move to close the loophole that allows companies to give free vaping samples to children, and the announcement of a new illicit vape enforcement squad, she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we need stricter regulation now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, along with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153swift and non-judgmental health support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to children who are already addicted. The Department of Health and Social Care\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s consultation on youth vaping, which closed on 6 June, should be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the catalyst for change that is so urgently needed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, De Souza urged. Ministers are considering \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on vaping to deter their sale to children after the call for evidence, which are understood to include banning colourful branding or flavours. On Tuesday, the Royal College of Paediatricians and Child Health called for a ban on disposable vapes, which would bring the UK more closely in line with comparable countries. Australia has made vaping prescription-only, while New Zealand banned most disposable vapes this week and will no longer allow new vape shops near schools. Scotland, France, Germany and Ireland all also have tougher rules. De Souza\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call draws on data gathered from nearly 500,000 children as part of a wide-ranging survey looking into happiness and wellbeing in England. Children were asked what they thought would stop them from achieving what they wanted to when the grew up, to which many responded that vaping would. Their concerns focused on the lack of parental support to stop vaping, peer pressure from other children, and the influence of social media. Asked what the government should do to make children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives better, children and adults mentioned the need to prevent children from vaping, such as enforcing bans. Parents also raised concerns about child-friendly packaging and flavourings. The research also showed that vulnerable children, such as those regularly seen by a social worker or those who had a disabled parent, might be more likely to vape than those who did not. The analysis suggested that children who had vaped were less likely to believe that vapes were harmful than those who had not. One child who responded to the research said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the toilets at school because everyone is vaping in there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also noticed how some of the popular kids in my school have found their interest in vapes [and] drugs and that speaks for itself and most of us are only 13!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One 12-year-old girl said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe many children are being influenced to do wrong things because social media is promoting them such as drugs, teen pregnancy, smoking and vaping etc.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is illegal to sell nicotine vapes to children and we are concerned about the recent rises in youth vaping \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly because of the unknown long-term harms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are taking bold action to crack down on youth vaping through the \u00c2\u00a33m illicit vapes enforcement squad to tackle underage sales to children.

The number of live radio programs will be reduced over the next few years because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technology is changing media\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the managing director, David Anderson, said. The ABC has 60 local radio stations as well as national networks including News Radio, Radio National, Triple J, Classic and Radio Australia. Asked in an interview if radio was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153under threat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anderson told ABC Radio Perth it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inevitable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that audiences for some programs will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so small\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rationalised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because most of the audience will have moved to digital delivery.

More people are consuming video via on demand and streaming services than they are for broadcast and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s similar for audio.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Anderson said the percentage of 65 to 75 year olds who regularly watch TV on demand is now 65% and will increase to 88% in three years. However, local radio, which has always been the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the ABC, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will not change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he said. Anderson said ABC Radio networks reached five million people every week and one million that listened to audio via a digital service but online listening was growing. The digital-first approach will be applied to commissioning, producing and distributing content, which means programming for the traditional TV schedule will become less important, Anderson said. The corporation is undergoing a major restructure by 1 July which will see the abolition of the separate regional and radio division and lead to redundancies of management and staff. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This story was updated on 9 June 2023.

Sushiro, Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest operator of revolving sushi restaurants, filed the suit with a court in Osaka, according to the Kyodo news agency, arguing that it had suffered financial losses after the incident triggered public fears over food hygiene. The teenager, who has not been named, allegedly licked the soy sauce bottle and the rim of a teacup before placing it back on a shelf, then wiped saliva on a plate of passing sushi destined for other diners, during a visit to a Sushiro outlet in January. A video of the incident filmed by a second person went viral, forcing restaurant chains to take drastic measures to reassure nervous customers. In March, police arrested three people on suspicion of forcible obstruction of business, including a 21-year-old who allegedly drank from a communal soy sauce bottle at a kaitenzushi restaurant run by Kura Sushi. The firm said at the time: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sincerely hope that society widely acknowledges antisocial acts are crimes, and that these kinds of actions are not committed in future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The arrests \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first involving customers suspected of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unhygienic and harassing behaviour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c came amid reports of other acts of sabotage involving food in the multibillion-dollar budget dining sector. In April, a man in his 30s was indicted on similar charges after he was filmed using his own chopsticks to remove pickled ginger from a container intended for all diners at a beef bowl restaurant. The pranks forced several chains to take action. One halted its conveyor belts, and another started delivering sushi via an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153express lane\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to customers who order via touch-screen devices, making it harder for other diners to tamper with food. In its suit against the teenager, Sushiro said it had experienced a sharp drop in diners after the incident, adding that its parent company had suffered a \u00c2\u00a516bn fall in market capitalisation at the end of January, Kyodo reported. The news agency said the firm could seek additional damages after it was forced to spend \u00c2\u00a590m on extra hygiene measures, including installing plastic barriers at more than 600 restaurants. The teenager has admitted licking communal items and expressed remorse for his actions. His lawyers have said that he did not intend for the video to be posted online, adding that fierce competition in the budget sushi sector \u00e2\u20ac\u201c worth an estimated \u00c2\u00a5740bn \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meant it was impossible to blame the drop in Sushiro customers on his actions."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/09/tanz-review-nudity-vomit-and-walkouts-yet-this-bloody-ballet-is-beautiful-too", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Tanz review: nudity, vomit and walkouts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet this bloody ballet is beautiful, too", "lead": "Austrian performance artist Florentina Holzinger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exploration of ballet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dark side is not just provocative but surprisingly thoughtful and hilarious", "author": "Tim Byrne", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T03:17:08Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896917", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/4aef0e9a92bddba6f274e3af67d90c0607428549/531_426_5229_3137/500.jpg", "body": "Reclamation is a powerful thing. When you take what oppresses you and weaponise it you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just neutralise your enemy, you take a step closer to some kind of equanimity. In Tanz, playing briefly at Melbourne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rising festival, the Austrian performance artist and choreographer Florentina Holzinger seizes on the pointe shoe, ballet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deeply troubling symbol of beauty through physical pain and makes of it a totem, bloody and brutal. Not that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first artist to see ballet as a form of torture. Darren Aronofsky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Swan explored the prima ballerina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career through the prism of body horror; Powell and Pressburger spun a nightmarish vision out of the creative urge with The Red Shoes, transforming it into a literal dance of death. Even Luca Guadagnino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2018 remake of Suspiria exploited the idea of dance as a manifestation of witchcraft, an act of violence against the self and the other. Holzinger seems perfectly aware of these antecedents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for nothing that her dancers wear red pointe shoes, nor that she includes a scene of atrocity via the art of telekinesis in an overt reference to Guadagnino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s film \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but she is also determined to carve her own distinctly feminist path, even if it requires a chainsaw and some meat hooks. Tanz takes those previous investigations into ballet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dark side, rolls them up into a spit ball and shoots it straight into the audience\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye. The show opens with an ordinary ballet class, presided over by the real-life German ballet legend Beatrice \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trixie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cordua. Everything is perfectly credible save the fact Cordua is stark naked and keen to get her students de-robed as soon as possible. Incredibly inappropriate sexualisation occurs, along with increasingly surreal divertissements, until Holzinger herself comes downstage and explains a few things. What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve witnessed is the naturalistic first act; what will follow is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the freaky shit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

Tanz includes scenes of mutilation, gynaecological examination, vomiting. Performers mount aerial motorbikes, lift themselves up by their hair, impale someone on a metal rod. At one point, a woman in her 80s gives birth to a rat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just provocative, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a deliberate affront. It is also, in the most surprising way, thoughtful, hilarious and occasionally very beautiful. It takes a serious artist to navigate so many modes and keep the audience on side. Admittedly, not everyone is on side all of the time and even those most inclined to Holzinger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perspective will find something confronting in it. Some people on opening night walked out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a couple of men in the front few rows rather ostentatiously exited before things got remotely degrading \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but those who remained may have felt as though they had passed through a ritual of some kind, eldritch and unholy. Tanz takes what have become theatrical cliches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sudden piercingly loud sound effects, Artaud-inspired acts of occultism, a stage increasingly awash with debris and destruction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and gathers them into a funny and furious howl of resistance. The work flirts with pure silliness but it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remotely spurious or glib. The program notes list two dramaturgs (Ren\u00c3\u00a9e Copraij and Sara Ostertag), a theorist and researcher (Anne Leon) and even \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outside eyes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Michele Rizzo and Fernando Belfiore). They bring an intellectual heft that animates everything on stage. Technically, what looks like theatrical carnage is often ingenious and supple. Stefan Schneider\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sound composition swirls and surges, lifts into ethereal harmonies and pitches into guttural screaming. The video design (Josefin Arnell and Jessyca R Hauser) is striking, and even \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a show where everyone is naked most of the time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the costumes (advised by Mael Blau) are powerfully effective, with their fairytale wolves and witches, their nods to Swan Lake and La Sylphide. Holzinger draws on a range of resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from Bruno Bettelheim to Ghostbusters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in a freewheeling exploration of female bodies and the history of romantic ballet, her eye firmly on the horrors and violence inflicted on women in the pursuit of beauty. Tanz is angry and goading but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also funny and, in the end, strangely rapturous. It is perfect festival fare, boundary-pushing and unforgettable. An act of theatrical reclamation that should by rights produce a bonfire of ballet shoes everywhere. Tanz is on as part of Melbourne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rising festival until 10 June; Florentina Holzinger is also performing her show A Divine Comedy at Dark Mofo in Hobart 16-18 June"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/09/julian-assange-dangerously-close-to-us-extradition-after-losing-latest-legal-appeal", "primaryCategory": "media", "title": "Julian Assange \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdangerously close\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to US extradition after losing latest legal appeal", "lead": "Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father, John Shipton, said his son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grounds for a further hearing were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcclear, firm and just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122", "author": "Ben Doherty", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T02:55:54Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896920", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d7b17f37fa5d97dddfd64f9f4382dcbc6231a558/0_285_4381_2630/500.jpg", "body": "Julian Assange is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerously close\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to being extradited to the US after losing his latest legal appeal, his family and observers of his long-running legal challenge say. His lawyers say they will appeal again to the same court, amid growing fears he could spend the rest of his life in prison for publishing thousands of classified military and diplomatic documents. In a three-page judgment handed down on Tuesday, UK high court judge Justice Jonathan Swift rejected all eight grounds of Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal against the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extradition order, signed by then UK home secretary Priti Patel in June last year. But Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, Stella Assange, said her husband would make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153renewed application for appeal to the high court\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd next week. The matter would then be heard before two new judges in a public hearing, Stella Assange said.

Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal argued that Patel, as home secretary, erred in her decision to approve the extradition order because the request violated the US-UK extradition treaty which states \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extradition shall not be granted if the offence for which extradition is requested is a political offence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His legal team has consistently maintained that the US desire to try Assange is politically motivated. The appeal also argued Assange was being prosecuted for protected speech, and that the extradition request itself was an abuse of process. Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal team has also said the US government has consistently misrepresented the core facts of the case to the British courts. Swift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rejection of the appeal grounds leaves only one final step in the UK courts: the defence has five working days to submit an appeal of 20 pages to a panel of two judges, who will convene a public hearing. There are no further appeal avenues at the domestic level. Assange could still fight the extradition at the European court of human rights, which last December confirmed that an application from Assange had been received. Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother, Gabriel Shipton, told the Guardian the high court rejection of his appeal was a serious development, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that leaves him dangerously close now to extradition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Shipton said the moments of setback were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the toughest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his brother. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These times are always very hard for Julian in the prison. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously focused on this next appeal \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not doing well. This saga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been going on 13 years and it is taking its toll on his body and on his mind. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But he still has a fighting spirit, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just hoping he makes it through this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shipton said the Australian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public statements it was advocating for Assange\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release were insufficient. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been hearing this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenough is enough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for over a year, it rings hollow now, these strange platitudes from the government about \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmaking representations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. What has that achieved? Nothing has changed, and the Australian government can certainly be doing more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rebecca Vincent, director of campaigns with Reporters Sans Frontieres said RSF was deeply concerned by the high court judgment \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is absurd that a single judge can issue a three-page decision that could land Julian Assange in prison for the rest of his life and permanently impact the climate for journalism around the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The historical weight of what happens next cannot be overstated; it is time to put a stop to this relentless targeting of Assange and act instead to protect journalism and press freedom. Our call on President Biden is now more urgent than ever: drop these charges, close the case against Assange, and allow for his release without further delay.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Assange faces 18 charges over WikiLeaks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 publication of classified documents, largely the result of a leak by the former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison but released after President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017. If convicted, Assange faces a combined total sentence of up to 175 years in prison. He has been held, in deteriorating health, in Belmarsh prison for more than four years, as he has contested the US extradition order."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2023/jun/09/sun-sets-on-david-kochs-21-years-of-breakfast-television-with-farewell-extravaganza", "primaryCategory": "media", "title": "Sun sets on David Koch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21 years of breakfast television with farewell extravaganza | Weekly Beast", "lead": "Anthony Albanese, Kevin Rudd and the Beaconsfield mine disaster survivors among huge cast as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcKochie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 signs off.

Gender furore The relationship between the Age and one of its columnists, Julie Szego, has imploded over a freelance article which was commissioned by the former Age editor Gay Alcorn over a year ago. Szego, who also wrote a regular opinion column for the Melbourne newspaper, went public with her disappointment when the piece she submitted when Alcorn was still at the helm was not published. The lengthy piece is about youth gender transition, a topic Szego has been interested in for some time now.

Smithy remembered One of the greats of sports reporting, Wayne Smith, died suddenly aged 69 this week. Smith had a stellar 50-year career reporting on Queensland rugby, Australian swimming and Test cricket before retiring from News Corp in 2021. Writing in the Australian, Peter Lalor said the news had hit the sporting community hard: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Journalists paused at The Oval in London before the World Test Championship to process the loss. English rugby reporters, Olympic veterans and the swimming fraternity all expressing their sadness at the passing of a legendary colleague and competitor.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There is one non-sporting incident for which \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Smithy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will also be remembered and it came when he was an assistant editor of the Courier-Mail in the 1990s under the editorship of the culture warrior Chris Mitchell. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the quirkier tasks in which Smithy was conscripted, in fact, was that antediluvian culture war crusade about Manning Clark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Order of Lenin,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the cricket writer Gideon Haigh wrote in the Australian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One night on tour in Hobart, Peter Lalor, Andrew Faulkner and I cajoled Smithy into narrating it, and the tale could not have been outdone by Robert Harris; we laughed until we were sore.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Haigh is referring to a notorious incident in 1999 when the Courier-Mail, under Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s byline, claimed Clark was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Soviet agent of influence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who had been awarded the Order of Lenin, the highest civilian decoration bestowed by the Soviet Union. It soon emerged there was no evidence for the claim and an investigation by the Australian Press Council found the allegation to be false, but Mitchell never retracted the story or apologised. Army flaks keep their heads down Now that Ben Roberts-Smith has lost his defamation case and been found by a federal court judge on the balance of probabilities to have murdered unarmed civilians while serving in the military in Afghanistan, even Army PR is feeling vulnerable as some members of the armed forces push back against the media. The Australian Army Public Relations Service Association has warned its members that they may feel that pressure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a perception in army that we are \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmedia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the association told members in a post seen by the Weekly Beast. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There may be a slight blowback internally in you doing your job.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The damage to army has been great and potential damage from criminal proceedings even greater,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the post said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the light of these current and future problems, the focus will be on army reputation and minimising harm our corp has a huge role in this moving forward.

The exact nature of the indictment, filed in federal district court in Miami, is unclear because it remains under seal and the justice department had no immediate comment. Trump confirmed the indictment on his Truth Social social media platform on Thursday afternoon, shortly after his lawyers received an email from prosecutors in the office of special counsel Jack Smith that outlined the charges and summoned the former president to surrender himself to authorities in Miami next Tuesday. The charges listed in the summons included: wilful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document, corruptly concealing a document, concealing a document in a federal investigation, engaging in a scheme to conceal and false statements, people familiar with the matter said. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer Jim Trusty confirmed in an appearance on CNN that prosecutors had listed seven charges on the summons paper. Trusty said he had not seen a copy of the indictment but added he was hopeful that it might be unsealed before Trump makes his initial appearance in court. From his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey, Trump lashed out at the indictment in a series of posts on Truth Social. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never thought it possible that such a thing could happen to a former President of the United States,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I AM AN INNOCENT MAN!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The former president was said to be resigned to the fact that he would probably be indicted after prosecutors impaneled a new grand jury in Florida to take evidence in the case last month, which his advisers saw as a sign that the case had been moved from Washington for its final stages. But even though Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers were told last week that the former president had been designated a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153target\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the criminal investigation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the clearest indication that charges were forthcoming \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the news of the indictment appears to have taken Trump and his inner circle by surprise. Trump spent the early part of the evening calling allies on Capitol Hill to rally support and watching who was defending him on cable news, a person close to the former president said. He then went for dinner at the golf club and played DJ, selecting songs to play over its loudspeakers. The former president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team also later released a short video, recorded a day beforehand, in which he again proclaimed his innocence. In Washington, the House speaker, Kevin McCarthy, called the charges a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dark day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a post on Twitter that falsely suggested the Biden administration, rather than a grand jury, had returned the indictment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153House Republicans will hold this brazen weaponization of power accountable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. Criminal charges in the Mar-a-Lago documents case deepen the legal peril for Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, after he was indicted earlier this year on state charges in New York by the Manhattan district attorney over his role in hush-money payments to an adult film star. Trump also remains under criminal investigation for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. For more than a year, prosecutors have examined whether Trump knowingly retained classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after he left office and took steps to conceal the materials after the justice department issued a subpoena for their return. The criminal investigation started last February when the National Archives issued a referral to the justice department after discovering more than 100 classified documents mixed with presidential records in 15 boxes that Trump returned. When the justice department reviewed the classified documents, people familiar with the investigation said, top officials in the national security division were alarmed to find that some of the materials amounted to national defense information that is controlled by the Espionage Act. The issue was the sheer volume and the sensitivity of classified materials in the boxes. According to an estimate provided to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers at the time, the 15 boxes included over 100 documents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more than 700 pages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that had the potential to implicate national security. The discovery presented a problem for the department because Trump was no longer authorized to retain such documents once he left office and officials grew concerned that Trump might be in possession of further classified documents that were also national security materials. The espionage investigation has been focused on whether Trump showed off national security materials in his office at Mar-a-Lago, and has questioned multiple witnesses about whether Trump waved around classified documents he had kept when no longer authorised to after he left office. Prosecutors have also asked witnesses about documents concerning potential US military action against Iran, after Trump referenced such a document in a meeting at Bedminster in July 2021 where he said he could not show a certain document because he did not declassify it when president. To that end, prosecutors have shown an Iran document to some witnesses who appeared before the Washington grand jury and asked whether they had ever been shown the material by Trump or anyone else. It was not clear whether any witness confirmed seeing the document, one of the people said. The investigation into the obstruction, meanwhile, has focused on whether the failure by Trump to fully comply with the subpoena last year was a deliberate act of obstruction because he wanted to retain the classified documents even after he had left office, the people said. Last June, the since-recused Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran found 38 classified documents in the storage room at Mar-a-Lago and told the justice department that no further materials remained there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which came into question when the FBI seized 101 more classified documents months later. Corcoran later told associates he felt misled because he had asked whether he should search elsewhere at Mar-a-Lago, such as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, but was waved off, the Guardian first reported. Corcoran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notes also showed he told Trump he had to return all classified documents in his possession."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/jun/09/calculated-media-campaign-being-waged-amid-lehrmann-defamation-trial-lawyers-for-ten-and-lisa-wilkinson-allege", "primaryCategory": "media", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCalculated\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 media campaign being waged amid Lehrmann defamation trial, lawyers for Ten and Lisa Wilkinson allege", "lead": "Lawyers for Bruce Lehrmann denied involvement and rejected the allegation", "author": "Christopher Knaus", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T02:18:15Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896930", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/79faf626d86626a69025c7933064e571aaf607b6/0_173_7532_4522/500.jpg", "body": "Lawyers for Network Ten and Lisa Wilkinson have made explosive allegations that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calculated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concerted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd media campaign using restricted court material is being waged to pressure and dissuade witnesses from giving evidence in the defamation trial brought by Bruce Lehrmann. Sue Chrysanthou SC, counsel for Wilkinson, and Matt Collins KC, counsel for Network Ten, on Friday complained of a significant amount of publicity on Channel Seven and in News Corp publications in recent days. They complained the coverage relied on material that had been produced under compulsory orders during Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s criminal trial, but was never tendered, which would be against rules governing the sharing of such material. The subject material included a copy of the contents of Brittany Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 phone, recordings of police interviews with important witnesses, and a recording of the five-hour pre-interview meeting between Higgins, David Sharaz, Wilkinson, and producer Angus Llewellyn. Chrysanthou said the publicity had put improper pressure on Wilkinson. She said it was clear that someone was engaged in a concerted campaign and accused media outlets of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dishonestly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd editing the five-hour tape. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[The] publicity has been to such an extent that it tends to and has had the effect of ... putting improper pressure on my client, overwhelmingly so,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now these media organisations are, it would appear, wholly publishing one side of the story.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She described the Channel Seven Spotlight program \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which featured an interview with Lehrmann interspersed with excerpts of the audio recording featuring Wilkinson, Sharaz, and Higgins \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a deliberate attack on my client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professionalism as a journalist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was no attempt to approach my client prior to broadcast to ask her questions about what was happening in that recording,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve written to Channel Seven about this and we have said that this has led us to infer that you had no interest in our client\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s version and the whole purpose of the broadcast was just to impugn her, but also to infer you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want us to know you had this audio recording because that would have led to an injunction application in [ACT supreme court chief justice] McCallum\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s court.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chrysanthou also alleged the public campaign was designed to malign Higgins, a likely witness, and was having a significant impact on her. She said there were real concerns that the publicity would mean \u00e2\u20ac\u0153witnesses won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is material from this police brief and material produced on subpoena in this criminal trial that is being distributed to the media. There is no doubt about that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tendered in court and it seems to us to be an orchestrated campaign.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Collins said Lehrmann had signalled publicly during his interview with the Spotlight program that he intended to run a public campaign against Higgins and the respondents in the media. He said the publicity was such that it was having the effect of putting pressure on witnesses who would be giving evidence in the defamation trial. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a trial coming before Your Honour in a few short months. The publicity of the last few days can only have been calculated to put pressure on witnesses not to give evidence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Justice Michael Lee suggested that such matters were better heard by the ACT supreme court, through contempt of court proceedings. The parties asked the federal court to allow them to put questions to Lehrmann to ascertain whether he was responsible. Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counsel Matthew Richardson SC rejected the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grave\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd allegation. They said Lehrmann denied involvement and the allegations from the media were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153aggravating damages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the defamation case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have no idea, they are fishing around in the dark,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Richardson also rejected the suggestion that there were only three parties who had access to some of the restricted material. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a very, very significant pool of people who could have done it, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the point,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. He said an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infinite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd amount of media coverage remained online that suggested Lehrmann\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guilt of the allegation. Lee rejected the attempt to have questions put to Lehrmann. He described the interrogation attempt as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fishing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to give leave at this stage to administer interrogatories in the form that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been provided,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Chrysanthou signalled a further application would be made on the issue. Lehrmann is suing Ten and Wilkinson over their initial reporting of Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rape allegations, which he denies. The rape trial was aborted due to juror misconduct and a second trial was abandoned due to concerns about the risk it posed to Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 life. He has also commenced proceedings against the ABC for broadcasting a live address by Higgins to the national press club. Earlier, the court ruled against having a jury trial, citing the significant publicity around the case and the difficulties in guarding against prejudice. The court also heard that Channel Seven and ACT prosecutors had handed over documents under subpoena for the purposes of the defamation proceedings."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/us-virginia-class-submarines-hit-further-two-year-delay-as-australia-awaits-2030-delivery", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "US Virginia class submarines hit further two-year delay as Australia awaits 2030 delivery", "lead": "Experts have warned that the US program is too tightly squeezed to produce Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s additional subs, which are meant to fill a capability gap", "author": "Tory Shepherd", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T01:58:04Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896934", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/40c028b337a53b76b350a5e44b36a8e34c9ded4b/0_123_2200_1321/500.jpg", "body": "A United States nuclear powered submarine program \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which Australia is depending on to provide up to five boats under the Aukus deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has hit a two-year delay. The latest report from the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) said that performance on the construction of the Block V Virginia class nuclear-powered submarine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continues to degrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Supply chain issues, severe workforce shortages and limited physical capacity mean the US is struggling to meet its target of building two ships a year. Block V is the latest version of the Virginia class and incorporates undersea acoustic improvements and a plan for bigger boats that can carry more Tomahawk cruise missiles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The program now estimates construction of each Block V submarine will take an average of over two years longer than reported last year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the GAO report said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The delays are due to problems meeting original staffing and work efficiency estimates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Under the Aukus plan, Australia will buy three Virginia class submarines from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as soon as\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the early 2030s, with an option to buy two more. That deal will rely on the approval of US congress. The purchase is intended to close a looming capability gap after Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s existing Collins class submarines are retired, and before the first nuclear-powered submarine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c SSN-Aukus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is delivered in the early 2040s. The Aukus submarine will be based on the UK design, incorporating US submarine technology. At least the first two Virginia class submarines bound for Australia will be secondhand, likely from blocks III or IV, but delays on future builds will make it harder for the US to give up any submarines. Even before this latest report, experts were warning the US program was too tightly squeezed trying to provide its own fleet to spare any for Australia. Program officials told the GAO a new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more realistic schedule\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was being created to deal with a workforce that was, as of September 2022, 25% below needs. They also said they are outsourcing some work due to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153workforce constraints and the limited physical capacity of some facilities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Those delays are also contributing to cost increases, so the navy will request more funds to complete construction. Defence analyst Peter Jennings, the director of Strategic Analysis Australia, said the GAO report \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crystallises a problem we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known about for a very long time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but that Aukus could be the solution to that problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to be optimistic that it will change, but the big benefit of Aukus is the pooling of three industrial capabilities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I see that really as a risk reduction strategy.

The more we know about what occurred on some patrols, the more the public demands accountability. The fact that a pattern of behaviour seems to have been established over an extended period fuels that demand, as the egregious actions can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be dismissed as errant behaviour that occurred in the fog of war. The Brereton Report went through in forensic, if redacted detail about dozens of incidents where war crimes may have occurred. Even more detail is contained in Justice Besanko\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voluminous judgment in Ben Roberts-Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ill-fated defamation action. The verdict was damning. One soldier has been charged by the Office of the Special Investigator and it is hard to imagine that other personnel won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be charged with war crimes in the months to come. The Australian public, for whom the military has long held a special place in the national psyche, are entitled to answers as to how this sad state of affairs came to be. Media commentators, veterans groups and others have raised questions about the accountability of those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153higher up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the chain of command. And herein lies the difficulty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c none of those commentators can define what \u00e2\u20ac\u0153higher up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means, while few understand the nature and definition of military command and control. Neither do people have a good idea of what they mean when they want people \u00e2\u20ac\u0153held to account\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. While no one doubts the validity of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153command responsibility\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in modern coalition campaigns command and control concepts can be complex. Australian units may be working under the operational direction of coalition headquarters so that national commanders have little oversight over the day-to-day operations of such units. Force elements may be deployed in different countries hundreds of kilometres away from their national headquarters. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The ability of in-country headquarters to influence the conduct of individuals is equally constrained when you are talking about the activities of small patrols operating well away from their command chains. Much trust is necessarily placed in junior commanders in the field. Brereton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal and military training allowed him to understand the peculiarities of contemporary command and control responsibilities and the difficulties in exercising them in the Afghanistan context. His report makes note of the command status of force elements accused of war crimes, although most readers unfamiliar with them may find them hard to decipher. Yet it is essential to understand what responsibilities various states of command or control confer on commanders before one calls for individuals to be held to account. The decision to commit a war crime is ultimately the responsibility of the individual who carried it out. That is not to say that the type of behaviour revealed in the Brereton Report and the defamation trial could not, and likely should not, have been stopped with better oversight. This is reflected in the fact that other, more senior personnel have had administrative action taken against them. Exactly how high up the chain of command people should be held accountable for the actions of a small number of rogue soldiers acting independently at the tactical level will always be a subjective matter. It certainly exercised the mind of Justice Brereton and the views regarding it expressed in his report should be read closely. That having been said, more senior officers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 careers have been halted as a result of the actions of a few soldiers, even though privacy considerations preclude them from being made public. If it is difficult to apportion blame and then determine what administrative action is appropriate for more senior commanders, the issue of honours and awards should be a more straightforward issue. It is entirely appropriate that individual medals and unit commendations awarded over the period when war crimes were allegedly committed be reviewed. Collective awards rely on the meritorious conduct of all of those who served in the unit. If some of that group conducted themselves in a manner anathema to what the army stands for, then there is no way that the collective award should stand. The same goes for individual medals normally awarded to commanders for meritorious service on operations. The chief of the defence force, Gen Campbell, has advised that a review has been conducted into such awards and is currently with the minister. This is as it should be. The military should be held accountable for the shortcomings of some of its best-trained soldiers. Those calling for such accountability, though, should understand the nature of operational command and control and those empowered and equipped to exercise it. Without knowing this, vague calls for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153higher ups\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to be held accountable risk drawing attention away from those individuals ultimately responsible for war crimes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the people who pulled the trigger.

The case marks the first time the justice department has charged Trump and adds to the mounting legal troubles Trump faces as he seeks to return to the presidency. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a breakdown of where things stand: What is this case about? When Donald Trump left the White House, he took documents related to his presidency with him to Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Florida. Federal law requires presidential documents to be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration (Nara). In May of 2021, Nara discovered it was missing records from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency and began requesting that the former president return them. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorneys later turned over 15 boxes of records that included 184 documents that were classified in some way. Nara referred the matter to the justice department, and the FBI began investigating in February of 2022. Over the next few months, the FBI and justice department went about trying to retrieve additional classified documents from Mar-a-Lago. In June of 2022, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers turned over 38 additional documents with classified markings. In August of 2022, the FBI conducted a raid on Mar-a-Lago and found more than 100 documents with classified markings. The justice department has been investigating whether classified material was mishandled and whether there was obstruction of its investigation in the matter. What is Trump charged with? Trump is charged with wilful retention of national defense information, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document, corruptly concealing a document, concealing a document in a federal investigation, engaging in a scheme to conceal and false statements, people familiar with the matter told the Guardian. Why are these charges significant? This is the first time that Trump has faced federal criminal charges. The other criminal matters pending against Trump are in state courts. The justice department is generally extremely careful when it chooses to bring cases and so the fact that prosecutors felt confident enough to indict Trump, knowing the political maelstrom that would result, is a signal of the strength of the case against him. Where do the other criminal cases and investigations against Trump stand? Trump was indicted by a Manhattan grand jury in March and also faces criminal charges in New York over hush money payments to Stormy Daniels. The district attorney in Fulton county, Georgia, is also investigating Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to overturn the election there and has signaled charges could come this summer. What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some of the strongest evidence in the classified documents case? Prosecutors obtained a 2021 recording of Trump in which he discusses a classified document in his possession dealing with a military confrontation with Iran, CNN reported earlier this month. On the recording, Trump reportedly acknowledges that the document is classified. That admission is significant because it could undercut a key defense from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the idea that he declassified the documents while he was president. Prosecutors have also obtained roughly 50 pages of dictated notes from Evan Corcoran, one of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorneys, that shed light on Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response to a justice department subpoena demanding the return of any classified documents. In one instance, Corcoran recounted warning Trump that he was obligated to return every classified document in his possession. The notes also detail Corcoran\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to locate the documents at Mar-a-Lago. As he recounted, Trump employees suggested that he search the storage room at the property. When Corcoran asked if he should look anywhere else, the Guardian has reported, he was told that should be sufficient \u00e2\u20ac\u201c advice that turned out to be flawed when the FBI later found classified material also in Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. How has Trump responded? Trump has decried the investigation as politically motivated and downplayed the significance of handling the documents. He has said he had the right to take some documents from office and did nothing different than Joe Biden and Mike Pence, both of whom had classified documents in their possession after leaving office. A separate special prosecutor is looking into Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of classified material and justice department officials have said they will not charge Pence. Who is leading the investigation? The attorney general, Merrick Garland, appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to take over the investigation in November. Smith is a former chief prosecutor of the Hague. He is also the former head of the justice department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public integrity section and a former federal prosecutor with experience in public corruption cases. Is this related to January 6? No. Smith is separately overseeing an investigation into Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Does a federal indictment prevent Trump from running for president? No. Neither the indictment itself nor a conviction would prevent Trump from running for or winning the presidency in 2024. And as the New York case showed, criminal charges have historically been a boon to his fundraising. The campaign announced that it had raised over $4m in the 24 hours after that indictment became public, far smashing its previous record after the FBI search of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mar-a-Lago resort.

Meta has yet to roll out any consumer-facing generative AI products, although it announced last month that it was working with a small group of advertisers to test tools that use AI to generate image backgrounds and variations of written copy for its ad campaigns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see Meta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predicament as anything other than a desperate scramble to catch up with its rivals on a number of fronts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Paul Barrett, the deputy director of New York University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. The company has been reorganizing its AI divisions and spending heavily to whip its infrastructure into shape, after determining early last year that it lacked the hardware and software capacity to support its AI product needs. Zuckerberg told employees at the session on Thursday that advancements in generative AI in the last year had now made it possible for the company to build the technology \u00e2\u20ac\u0153into every single one of our products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In addition to the consumer-facing tools, executives at the meeting also announced a productivity assistant for employees called Metamate that could answer queries and perform tasks based on information gleaned from internal company systems. Many of the tools being developed by Meta will be built around open-source models, which allow users to build their own artificial intelligence-powered chatbots and other technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a decision critics and competitors have criticized as opening up the tools to be used to spread misinformation and hate speech at a larger scale. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For better or worse, many people who want access to Facebook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data have malicious intent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media at Carnegie Mellon University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Heinz College. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need policies, procedures and protocols on board so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not rushing into something that might be deleterious for society in the future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd According to the New York Times report on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting, Zuckerberg addressed concerns about Meta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s open-source approach to AI, saying that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153democratizing access to this has a bunch of value\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He reportedly stated that he hoped in the future users could build AI programs on their own without relying on framework from a handful of large technology companies. Despite the new focus on AI, the New York Times reported Zuckerberg stated the company would not be abandoning its plans for the metaverse, echoing past statements he has made that the technology could be used to expand the virtual world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been focusing on both AI and the metaverse for years now, and we will continue to focus on both,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zuckerberg said on the tech firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest quarterly earnings call.

The plans set rules on how much water can be taken from the basin system and on how water is shared between towns, agriculture and the environment. The withdrawal of the seven plans occurred last week and was not publicised. NSW is now more than four years late in lodging the plans, raising serious questions about the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin plan, which is about to undergo a major review. Rose Jackson, Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water minister who took over the portfolio after the NSW election in March, said she wanted to submit revised plans and have them in place as soon as possible. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They should never have been submitted because they were never going to get accredited,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said of the efforts of her National party predecessor, Kevin Anderson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to waste time. They were clearly submitted when everyone knew they were flawed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. The wrangling over NSW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water resource plans has been one of the major failings of the Murray Darling Basin plan and has serious implications. Daniel Blacker, the head of regulatory in the inspector general\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, told Senate estimates last week that accredited water resource plans provide the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153key trigger in the commonwealth legislation for us to act on a water theft offence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Without approved water resource plans, the only regulation of the take of water from rivers by agriculture is under state rules, known as water sharing plans. These may ultimately prove inconsistent with water resource plans and the broader basin plan. The Murray Darling Basin Authority said NSW was reporting its water take under a bilateral agreement, but wants binding accredited plans to be in place. NSW\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor progress is a legacy of the previous Coalition government. Over the last four years National party ministers regularly threatened to pull out of the basin plan and said they could not meet the deadlines. NSW was forced to withdraw almost all of its 20 water resource plans in 2021 after it failed to meet the authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standards. It appears the next drafts were not much better; just four groundwater plans in NSW have been accredited. Plans for all the major rivers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Barwon Darling, Lower Darling, Gwydir, Namoi, Macquarie, Lachlan and the Border rivers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have been withdrawn. Another nine plans are still being assessed. During the dying days of the Coalition government in early 2023, the Nationals also moved to license the practice of floodplain harvesting despite multiple efforts by the NSW upper house to delay it until better scientific data was available on its impact. Floodplain harvesting is the practice of capturing flows over the flat plains of western NSW using dams and levies. The practice has grown enormously as cotton has expanded over the last two decades and has been blamed by some scientists for the 20% to 30% decline in flows into some rivers. The Guardian understands that while some plans can be remedied relatively easily, there are serious problems with the draft plans for the Barwon Darling, the Gwydir and the Namoi, which are major cotton growing areas. The new licences issued for floodplain harvesting may result in the total amount of water being extracted for agriculture exceeding the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153caps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that were agreed between the states. A spokesperson for the Murray Darling Basin Authority said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The plans are late, however it is important that they are of sufficient quality to meet basin plan requirements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Plans will not be recommended for accreditation until the authority assesses that they meet all 55 requirements of the basin plan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cate Faehrmann, the water spokesperson for the Greens, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly the National party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempt to allocate hundreds of gigalitres of floodplain harvesting entitlements to big irrigators in the northern basin has compromised the integrity of the basin plan and forced NSW to reassess its water resource plans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With another drought just around the corner, the minister must use her powers to rein in floodplain harvesting by reducing the massive entitlements recently gifted to irrigators to within legal limits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/jack-smith-special-counsel-explainer-donald-trump", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Jack Smith: veteran special counsel at the center of Trump investigations", "lead": "Prosecutor overseeing Mar-a-Lago classified papers and Trump election interference cases has indicted former president", "author": "Mary Yang", "datePublished": "2023-06-09T00:31:11Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896950", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ce5274e483dc16a478e1070e30afdc43f5a58ec5/0_100_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Donald Trump has been charged on seven counts, including violating the Espionage Act and conspiring to obstruct the criminal investigation, in a decision by special prosecutor Jack Smith. Smith, a veteran prosecutor and justice department official, has been at the center of two federal investigations into Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s misconduct \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one concerning Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interference with the certification of the 2020 election, and the other over the former president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mishandling of classified documents found at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort. Over a seven-month investigation, Smith and his team interviewed former White House officials, Trump aides and Mar-a-Lago staff in the classified documents investigation before handing down the decision on Thursday. A registered independent, Smith was appointed by the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, in November 2022 to serve as special prosecutor overseeing the two investigations. The Department of Justice has yet to deliver a decision concerning Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election. After he was appointed, Smith, then the chief prosecutor at the international criminal court, worked first from the Netherlands while he recovered from a cycling accident. Smith resigned from that role, where he investigated war crimes in Kosovo, to take up the special prosecutor post in the US. A career prosecutor Smith, whose career as a prosecutor spans three decades, spent more than a decade in New York, where he worked as an assistant US attorney from 1999 to 2008 after a stint as a prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. Its current head, Alvin Bragg, filed in April a 34-count indictment against Trump for falsifying business records to conceal hush payments to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election cycle. He was an assistant US attorney in Tennessee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and served for a short time as acting US attorney. From 2010 to 2015, Smith oversaw the justice department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public integrity section, which was created following the Watergate scandal to oversee corruption and prosecute crimes by government officials. Smith was appointed chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC) in 2018. Garland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement that he would appoint Jack Smith as special prosecutor overseeing the two federal criminal investigations came days after Trump announced he would again run for president. Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation revealed Trump acknowledged he kept classified documents Earlier this week, Smith was seen meeting with justice department lawyers and members of Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defense team, in a sign he would soon hand down a decision. Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team then informed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers in a letter that the ex-president was a target of the documents investigation, according to multiple reports. Mark Meadows, formerly Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief of staff, testified before a Florida grand jury on Wednesday, in another sign the investigation was nearing its end. Trump, however, had maintained he was unaware of the indictment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No one has told me I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being indicted, and I shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done NOTHING wrong,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump said in a Truth Social post. But Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation proves otherwise: among the evidence is an audio tape where Trump says he kept a classified document detailing a potential attack on Iran, CNN first reported.

This was even before the Reserve Bank slugged households with its 12th interest rate rise in 13 months. Misery indexes were thought up by the 1970s economist Arthur Okun. He had the idea that a combination of rising prices and high unemployment created hardship and drove social unhappiness. Wild. You mash together the data about both with a proportionality based on your favourite economist, and by doing so conclude just how bummed the collective vibe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s become. The Misery Index is also the name of a gameshow hosted by the star of The Good Place, Jameela Jamil. I mention this because in the 12 months leading up to the global financial crisis in 2007-08, the (economic) misery index in Australia rose 62%. In 2022, the index around these parts increased almost 220%, suggesting that wacky TV shows are perhaps the best fun on offer right now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you can still afford the streaming services. Australian households with the average $600,000 mortgage have been asked to find a spare $17,000 among the couch cushions since the RBA began its lifting-rates-a-thon last May. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rising costs of other expenses, such as transport. The Australian Automobile Association calculated the average cost of running a car in this country went up $28.31 a week in the March quarter; in Brisbane and Melbourne, it went up $34. With associated automotive costs, using a car in Sydney now averages $510 a week. Meanwhile, in regional Victoria, one food bank is shipping 40 tonnes of food every day to help struggling families. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Why are the price rises happening? International research conducted by the OECD concluded \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corporate profits contributed far more to Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise in inflation through the past year than from wages and other employee costs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been similar analysis from the European Central Bank. The Reserve Bank of Australia and Treasury disagree, I guess because the OECD is led by notorious communist Mathias Cormann. The RBA insists that the pay packets of Australian workers have magically, secretly swelled, and this is driving inflation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though, as Australian economist Stephen Koukoulas has said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real unit labour costs only rose 0.1% in the March quarter and 1% over the course of the year\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And how is it possible wages are inflicting such terrible damage when the ACTU could observe major local employers are enjoying profits at Scrooge McDuck levels? The latest half-yearly statements had Ampol bathing in $440m, Coles $616m, Qantas $1.4bn \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the Commonwealth Bank taking a swim in the gold coins pool at a depth of $5.15bn. Philip Lowe is the RBA governor. Although he has a whole bank board and a coterie of senior mandarins alongside him making rate rise decisions, he is certainly to blame for public statements that imply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153workers pay to solve inflation they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to quote (yet another) economist Jim Stanford. The theory for the rises is neoliberal orthodoxy; apply economic pressure to cause unemployment, and make those who retain their jobs live in such valid terror of the burning tyre-pit hell that is Centrelink that they won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make pay demands and therefore won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drive \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wage price\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd inflation. Lowe has generously suggested that those households struggling to keep up with rising mortgages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 27.8% of whom are now at risk of mortgage stress \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to just \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pick up more work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is Schr\u00c3\u00b6dinger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s employment policy, where the RBA advocates for and against employment at the same time, while you place a box on your head and scream at your ballooning mortgage repayments. An earlier Lowe suggestion was that those struggling with exploding rents should magic up some flatmates or move back to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153home\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that may or may not exist. You, Australian, are responsible for your own misery. But that means you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re responsible for your own happiness, right? So while you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re forced to cut spending, alleviate supermarket blues by performing a funky dance in the canned veg section the inevitable moment a Katy Perry song comes over the PA. Similarly, suppressing an instinct to ask for the wages you need to meet your costs can be a lot less painful if you hum your favourite 80s sitcom themes at work. Automotive costs might force you into long and difficult walks to overcrowded, underfunded public transport, so maybe commute in a clown suit. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re facing record rent rises, you could consider reciting beautifully sad poems from the nearest window and lure flatmates to you with your tender pain. History suggests there are alternatives, but demands for rent freezes and price controls are unconstitutional. Referendums to allow government economic intervention of this kind were defeated in 1948 and 1973. Faced with inflationary challenges in the 1950s, though, the Liberal government of Robert Menzies addressed the problem by raising taxes on the rich. Sadly, the Australian people voted Scott Morrison into power in 2019 on a promise to implement the stage-three tax cuts, and then a promise by Labor to keep these cuts on the books arguably convinced enough swing voters over the electoral line. There is no help coming for Australians from the RBA. Perhaps we should ask ourselves how much of this misery we might have power over, after all. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/08/wildfire-smoke-survival-guide-california-new-york", "primaryCategory": "environment", "title": "Surviving the smoke-pocalypse 101: Californians offer advice to New Yorkers", "lead": "Orange smoky skies might be a new phenomenon for those on the east coast, but for the American west, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the average summer", "author": "Dani Anguiano", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T23:23:01Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896956", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/20e6a0409076c1931c00359303a0a0e8ca7f650b/236_0_4892_2938/500.jpg", "body": "It was a sight all too familiar to Californians: orange skies and thick smoke blanketing the sky, emitting the eerily out-of-place smell of a campfire. But this time the scenes were in New York City, as smoke from more than 400 wildfires darkened the famous skyline and gave the US its worst day of air pollution in recent history. The scenes from the eastern seaboard harkened back to mid-September 2020 when out of control wildfires covered much of the American west in smoke, casting San Francisco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Golden Gate Bridge and skyscrapers under an otherworldly orange glow. Before this week, 13 and 14 September 2020 were the worst days since 2006 for pollution from wildfire smoke. Then came Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wildfires which brought a once unimaginable and faraway problem to a region unfamiliar with such a disaster and a public unaccustomed to the risks of wildfire smoke and the necessary precautions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if people understand how bad it can be,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Keith Bein, a professional researcher at the University of California, Davis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe the really healthy individual is not going to have a problem. [For] the susceptible populations, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real chance this could trigger something. This could be a tipping point.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While unprecedented on the east coast, residents of the American west have grown used to the effects of wildfires thanks to years of large-scale, devastating blazes that have upended life across the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and they have some advice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mask up, use an air purifier and stay indoors if you can. If you feel tired, cranky, or out of sorts, you are probably feeling the smoke,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the writer SE Smith on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some tips for friends on the east coast: 1) Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go outside 2) Wear a mask if you must go outside 3) Run an air purifier all day and all night 4) AC should be in recirculate mode. Sincerely, a coast who deals with this crisis often,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brandon Richards, a spokesperson for the California governor, said on Twitter. Smoke is now basically a California summer, the wildlife advocate Beth Pratt said on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A good air filter helps, but also just be careful with being outdoors (and monitor pets).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bein, who travels to wildfire zones to collect data on smoke to measure how it impacts humans, echoed that recommendation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Reduce as much as you can physical activity. You want to be idle, you want to stay indoors, close your windows, you want to turn on your HVAC systems. If you have a personal air purifier turn them on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The best thing to do is to leave the affected area, Bein said, acknowledging that in some events there is nowhere to go and not everyone has the resources to leave. He recommends that those who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access to resources in their home go to a public place that does, such as a library. People should also be wearing masks, particularly if they have a pre-existing condition or are part of a vulnerable group, such as elderly people and pregnant women. Wildfire smoke at the level seen on the east coast permeates everything and the risk for air pollution remains even when you cannot see or smell it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even after that subsides it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in the air, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still coming off your clothes and walls. The same is going to apply if it infiltrates your home and coats your walls, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disappear when the plume disappears.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Research into the impacts of wildfire smoke, both long-term and immediate, is a relatively recent development and there is much that is still unknown, Bein said. But studies have tied smoke exposure to increased heart attack risks, greater risk of premature births and decreased test scores in kids. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing good about breathing wildfire smoke,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Bein. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are you able to protect yourself?

The group said the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest retailer had not clearly explained the unit price of deals for its Clubcard holders \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as the price per 100g or 100ml \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so that shoppers could easily compare value for money between different sized packages, bottles, brands and retailers. It said the lack of unit pricing could be a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misleading practice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd under consumer protection regulations because it could make it difficult for shoppers to determine which was the cheapest product. In one example, Which? found a 700g bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup in Tesco for which the label showed the standard price to be \u00c2\u00a33.90, or 55.7p per 100g. A prominent Clubcard label showed the same size bottle on offer at \u00c2\u00a33.50, but the unit price, which would be 50p per 100g, was not given. At the same time a 910g bottle of the same ketchup on the shelf below was priced at \u00c2\u00a33.99, or 43.8p per 100g, for all shoppers, making it the cheapest option per 100g. Which? argued many shoppers would wrongly assume the Clubcard option was the best deal available. With double-digit food price inflation since last winter, supermarkets have come under scrutiny for practices such as stocking fewer of their cheaper ranges in small stores and high mark-ups on goods for home delivery. Sue Davies, the head of food policy at Which?, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tesco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unclear Clubcard pricing is at best confusing for shoppers struggling with soaring food inflation and at worst could be breaking the law. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is simply not good enough from the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biggest supermarket. Tesco should think of its customers and act now to introduce clear unit pricing on all offers, including Clubcard promotions, so shoppers can easily find the best value items. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We expect the regulator to look at unit pricing on the growing number of supermarket member price schemes as part of its review. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this time of crisis, supermarkets cannot cut corners. They have a duty to ensure pricing is clear so that customers can get the best value.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesperson for Tesco said the company had sought advice and approval from its local trading standards office in Hertfordshire, where the \u00c2\u00a319bn company has its headquarters, for its approach to Clubcard pricing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Providing great value and clear pricing is really important to us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they said.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are supportive of calls for greater clarity on the regulations in this area \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 However, given that we are complying with all the current rules, we are disappointed that Which? has chosen to make these ill-founded claims against our Clubcard Prices scheme, which helps millions of households get great value week-in, week-out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced in January that it would investigate the issue of unit pricing because it said it was important that shoppers were able to compare like with like, particularly during the cost of living crisis. The watchdog said it would examine retailers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 compliance with the law, consumer awareness and the use of unit price information, revisiting a similar investigation in 2015 when it recommended the government consider reviewing and clarifying the legal requirements on pricing. Asked for a response to the Which? complaint about Tesco, the CMA said it expected to publish its latest review, including recommendations for the government, in late July. It announced in May that it would look at whether a poorly functioning market was contributing to food price inflation, alongside a similar investigation into fuel prices. The chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, said last month that the government stood ready to update pricing rules and guidance after the CMA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s review."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/09/police-watchdog-for-england-and-wales-demands-new-powers-amid-trust-crisis", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Police watchdog for England and Wales demands new powers amid trust crisis", "lead": "Andy Cooke says trust in police \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchanging by a thread\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and forces failing to act on recommendations", "author": "Matthew Weaver", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T23:01:43Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896961", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0d7c4c71daa664b504588485bb31399ad9ae7f61/1277_263_5543_3326/500.jpg", "body": "The head of the police inspectorate in England and Wales has demanded sweeping new powers to compel police forces to tackle what he described as the worst crisis in law and order in living memory. In his first annual assessment as head of His Majesty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS), Andy Cooke said there was a limited opportunity to restore public trust in police before it was irreparably damaged. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Public trust in the police hanging by a thread,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cooke said. He said the crisis in public confidence in the police was partly due to a series of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dreadful scandals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd including the murder of Sarah Everard by the serving Metropolitan police officer Wayne Couzens and the 48 rape convictions of David Carrick, another Met officer. Such scandals could have been tackled earlier if the HMICFRS had the power to compel forces to follow its recommendations rather than relying on the current system of voluntary compliance, Cooke said. He expressed frustration at repeated failures of police forces, including the Met, to act on police inspectorate warnings first raised in 2016 over officers abusing their positions with victims for sexual purposes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In those seven years, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had some truly horrendous acts by police officers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said as he launched the report. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not saying that wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have happened if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done our recommendations earlier. But if I could direct around those issues, as opposed to recommending, a lot more would have been done a lot quicker.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Too often we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen forces failing to act, or not acting quickly enough, to address our recommendations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cooke urged the government to introduce legislation to make it a legal requirement for police forces to follow directions from the inspectorate on issues of public safety. His report also demands a role for HMICFRS in the recruitment of chief constables and other senior officers to improve the calibre of police chiefs. He called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantial reform\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of police vetting and recruitment processes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153including for chief officers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Cooke said too much police time was being wasted filling gaps left by cuts to public services. He endorsed a plan by the Met to stop attending emergency mental health calls. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So much of policing time has been diverted to other parts of a broken system \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it takes time a way from catching criminals,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many of these other public services are under financial pressure, too, and can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t meet their own demand. For example, in 2022 the police attended 600,000 incidents relating to mental health \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It is not the job for policing to treat mental health.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cooke, a former chief constable of Merseyside police, a force he joined in 1985, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall a time when the relationship between the police and public was more strained than it is now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He complained of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stark decline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in offences bought to justice, with the charge rate falling by two-thirds since 2015. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The police aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by a system of policing funding which is not fit for purpose and a criminal justice system which is dysfunctional and defective,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. He pointed out that the backlog of crown court cases had reached record levels last October. Cooke said such \u00e2\u20ac\u0153widespread systemic failings\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd also damaged public trust in the police. In a wide-ranging report, Cooke insisted that stop and search was an effective way of deterring crime and showing police visibility on the street. But he said police leaders should explain why it had been disproportionally used against black people. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean that the police are being racist \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also more disproportionality for victims. It is four times more likely as a black man to be murdered than a young white man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cooke urged police forces to avoid political campaigns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is not their role to champion social change,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The police need to prioritise the issues that matter most to the public. Forces are failing to get the basics right.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The National Police Chiefs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Council chair, Chief Constable Gavin Stephens, said the report highlighted the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153range of challenges in meeting the needs of communities across the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as well as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the dedication of officers, staff and volunteers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Policing must continue to do more to earn back the trust and confidence of the public, which we know has been eroded over recent years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To do so, we remain focused on preventing crime and disorder, listening to communities\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 concerns \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and providing consistently high-quality services in responding to emergencies, investigating crime and keeping people safe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The report also rightly recognises the pressure on the criminal justice system and mental health services and the serious impact this has for society in accessing justice and care.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Suella Braverman, the home secretary, welcomed the report, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I equally share his concern that policing needs strong leaders, a greater focus on the basics and issues that matter most to the public \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to be more visible in communities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been calling for common sense policing. With the highest number of police officers than ever before, the police must deliver for victims.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/08/boris-johnson-has-been-given-commons-partygate-inquiry-findings-say-sources", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Boris Johnson has been given Commons Partygate inquiry findings, say sources", "lead": "Ex-PM handed dossier laying out privileges committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings as inquiry into whether he misled parliament nears end", "author": "Aubrey Allegretti Senior political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T23:01:15Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896964", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ce525c6df7bbf6a7c5517836400cb3d7bd4779be/0_43_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Boris Johnson has been given the findings of an investigation into whether he misled parliament over Partygate, the Guardian has been told. With the nearly year-long inquiry drawing to a close, sources said a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153warning letter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had been submitted to the former prime minister containing criticisms for him to respond to. At stake is the future of Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political career \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a suspension of 10 days or more could lead to a byelection being triggered in his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency. Under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maxwellisation process\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Johnson was handed a dossier laying out the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s findings. It is said to contain the facts and evidence they are based on and any proposed sanctions. Johnson will have two weeks to reply, with the whole process conducted in secrecy. His response will be considered by the privileges committee before it finalises its report, expected to happen by the end of June. MPs then have to endorse the findings, which could threaten to shatter the fragile peace in the Conservative party that Rishi Sunak and his allies have attempted to broker. The government will get to choose when to table the motion to endorse the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report. It is expected to come before the Commons summer break, which starts on 20 July. MPs are likely to be given a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free vote\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though sometimes informal pressure is applied by telling them which way the chief whip is going to vote. MPs will also be able to amend the motion. Dozens of Tory backbenchers recently voted against a finding by the standards committee that another MP, Margaret Ferrier, be suspended from parliament for 30 days, for breaking Covid rules. Some have sought to draw parallels between the case and Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, but insiders played down the likelihood that the action taken against Ferrier set a precedent for potential punishment facing the former prime minister. All MPs passed a motion that set up the inquiry in April 2022, which examined whether he had misled parliament by repeatedly denying any Covid rules had been broken. Scotland Yard has issued more than 120 fines over Partygate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including to Johnson himself. A spokesperson for the privileges committee, which has a Tory majority but is chaired by Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Harriet Harman, said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proceeding in accordance with its previously published procedure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the committee decides to criticise Johnson, it will not come to a final conclusion until it has taken into account any further submissions from Johnson.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesperson was contacted for comment. They have previously said he was cooperating fully with the committee and insisted he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not knowingly, deliberately or wittingly mislead parliament\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Relations between Johnson and Sunak have deteriorated in recent weeks, after government officials handed over a tranche of his diaries from the pandemic prompting further investigation by two police forces and the privileges committee. In a move that has caused a major headache for Sunak, Johnson then handed over a batch of unredacted files, including WhatsApps, to the Covid inquiry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite the Cabinet Office taking legal action to avoid doing so. Fresh details about an event at Chequers during Covid were also revealed this week by the Guardian. But the privileges committee is not likely to hold up its final report to investigate them, as several such details were said to have been identified as part of the diaries handed to it last month. Though Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies have been wargaming how to avoid him being forced out of parliament by a negative finding by the privileges committee, public opinion appears to be against him. More than two-thirds of people (68%) believe he should resign as an MP if found to have intentionally misled parliament, according to a new survey by YouGov. The poll found that 56% think he lied about breaching lockdown rules and it was right for him to be held accountable, while a further 29% believe he lied but that the issue should be moved on from. Just 5% believe that Johnson did not lie and there was nothing to hold him accountable for, in a survey of 2,071 adults conducted on 6 and 7 June. Despite friends of Johnson, such as the former culture secretary Nadine Dorries, trying to paint the inquiry as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153witch-hunt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, 60% of Britons thought the inquiry was fair compared with 21% who said it was unfair."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/08/hsbc-temporarily-withdraws-mortgage-deals-for-new-borrowers", "primaryCategory": "money", "title": "HSBC temporarily withdraws mortgage deals for new borrowers ", "lead": "Bank removes all its \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnew business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 residential and buy-to-let products after surge in demand", "author": "Nadeem Badshah", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T22:47:12Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896981", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7f8afe5fd96eba3c31ad72314c0152ce84b143d3/0_605_4032_2419/500.jpg", "body": "HSBC has temporarily withdrawn mortgage deals for new borrowers due to a surge in demand ahead of expected rate rises.

Unveiling the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Atlantic declaration\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a joint press conference with Biden at the White House, Sunak was explicit that the closer links were designed to bolster economic security in response to threats from China and Russia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Countries like China and Russia are willing to manipulate and exploit our openness, steal our intellectual property, use technology for authoritarian ends or withdraw crucial resources,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prime minister said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They will not succeed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The declaration, published at the end of Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visit to Washington, is in some ways little more than a series of economic mini-deals. Relatively few details have been revealed, and no attempt has been made to estimate any overall economic benefit. However, its symbolism is significant, marking a shift away from the recent UK mantra of unfettered free trade in favour of mutual protectionism. The announcement also signalled the end of any hope of a full trade deal with the US, a key promise in the 2019 Tory manifesto. Questioned about the lack of a wider deal, Sunak said the declaration would nonetheless benefit UK companies, and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153responds to the particular opportunities and challenges that we face right now, and into the future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Labour said the Conservatives had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failed to deliver the comprehensive trade deal they promised\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, PA Media reported. Responding to the announcement of the declaration, David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour has consistently called on the government to secure closer economic ties with the United States to work together on the critical issues of our time \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but this statement shows the Conservative government has failed to deliver the comprehensive trade deal they promised in the 2019 manifesto, or to secure the ally status under the Inflation Reduction Act that is so important for the automotive sector and for the green transition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the Biden administration have enacted the Inflation Reduction Act to de-risk its economy from China and create jobs at home, the Conservatives have left Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cupboards bare.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Biden played up the economic benefits of the agreement, saying the UK could play \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a major role\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in providing the US with green technology such as batteries. In a welcome move for Downing Street, the president had warm words for Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea that the UK could become home to a regulator on artificial intelligence (AI), with a conference on the issue planned for the autumn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are looking to Great Britain to help lead a way through this,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Biden said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no country we have greater faith in to help negotiate our way through this. We are in lockstep.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Signed off in White House talks that began with jokey exchanges in the Oval Office before a waiting mass of reporters, the declaration yokes the UK into economic policies that some of Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ministers have labelled protectionist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, allowing British businesses to take advantage of US subsidies. After a visit in which Sunak was feted with full diplomatic pomp, it also shows an inclination for Biden and his team to work more closely with an ally whose stock had fallen under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss. Billed by No 10 as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a new action plan for cooperation on the biggest economic challenges of our time\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the declaration is intended to allow the two countries to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153move faster and cooperate more deeply\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on areas such as supply chains disrupted by Covid and the invasion of Ukraine. Setting aside a full-blown post-Brexit free trade deal, it sets out a series of sector-by-sector agreements on everything from defence procurement to data and professional qualifications. It was described in advance by UK officials as a pragmatic, forward-facing and less sentimental reset of transatlantic relations, and Sunak talked of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the indispensable alliance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a new formulation of the much-discussed special relationship. Asked about the status of this by reporters as the talks began, Biden replied with a thumbs-up, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In real good shape.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While Downing Street will be pleased to end the trip with a tangible achievement, there is an element of political risk. In one detail that could alarm Conservative free marketers, it brings the UK into the orbit of Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which lays out vast subsidies for green infrastructure, previously condemned by some UK ministers as market-skewing. One element of the declaration relating to minerals needed in battery technology will allow UK electric car manufacturers to benefit from some of the IRA subsidies regime. Amid the series of thus far mainly vague commitments is an acknowledgment by Sunak that UK economic security requires at least some acceptance of Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic world view. Notably, UK officials explicitly linked the move to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new Washington consensus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a US vision for economic security set out in March in a speech by Jake Sullivan, Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national security adviser, which repudiated the era of unconstrained globalisation and reliance on markets in the face of new threats. Asked whether he was embracing a Biden-led protectionist mantra, Sunak insisted this was not the case. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m absolutely of the view that this president does not believe in zero-sum competition amongst allies. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we declared together with our G7 partners just a few weeks ago in Hiroshima,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a president and an administration that is completely attuned to the needs and concerns of his allies on these issues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The agreement provides something tangible for the prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brief US visit, which had been heavy on ceremony but was mainly devoted to meetings with US politicians and businesspeople, plus a visit to a baseball game. Speaking to reporters on his way to the US, Sunak insisted he remained opposed to protectionism but said there was a need to seek economic security and guaranteed supply chains in the global situation that had evolved, one taking in not just Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine but Chinese threats to Taiwan. Among the specifics set out on Thursday, some of which will come into force swiftly, are new moves to designate UK defence suppliers as domestic contractors under the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Defence Production Act, meaning they will qualify for US government contracts. A deal on data protection is aimed at reducing difficulties for small firms doing UK-US trade. No 10 said this could save more than \u00c2\u00a390m a year. The two countries will also collaborate on key industries including AI, 5G and 6G telecoms, quantum computing, semiconductors and engineering biology. Other ambitions will take longer. While Sunak and Biden have signed up to further moves to mutually recognise professional qualifications for engineers, this will need state-by-state approval in the US."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/08/wildfires-latest-smoke-air-quality-canada-new-york-flight-delays-laguardia", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Canada wildfires: blazes intensifying due to climate crisis, says Kamala Harris; Trudeau accuses opposition of inaction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "US vice-president said administration working with Canada to tackle the crisis; Canadian PM accuses opposition leader of fighting climate plan", "author": "Maya Yang (now); Fran Lawther (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T22:09:57Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896989", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f6bd8f51638e90ce051434136940bc32ea0a8653/0_144_2200_1320/500.jpg", "body": "It is slightly past 6pm in New York City. Here is a wrap up of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key events: In a tweet on Thursday, US vice-president Kamala Harris said that the Canadian wildfires and subsequent smoke haze shrouding many east coast states \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are intensifying because of the climate crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She added that the Biden-Harris administration was working closely alongside Canadian officials in response to the crisis. The US experienced its worst toxic air pollution from wildfire smoke in its recent recorded history on Wednesday, researchers have found, with people in New York exposed to levels of pollution more than five times above the national air quality standard. The rapid analysis of the extreme event, shared with the Guardian, found that smoke billowing south from forest fires in Canada caused Americans to suffer the worst day of average exposure to such pollution since a dataset on smoky conditions started in 2006. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has lashed out against Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official conservative opposition, accusing him of refusing to put forward concrete plans to fight climate crisis. Speaking in parliament and gradually raising his voice, Trudeau said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the leader of the opposition to consider that the forest fires that are taking people from their communities and destroying their homes are a mere distraction \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is shameful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US president Joe Biden has spoken Trudeau and offered to deploy all available federal firefighting assets. In a statement released on Wednesday, the White House announced that the Biden administration has offered additional support to respond to the wildfires currently burning across Canada. Toxic smoke from Canadian wildfires could linger over vast swathes of the US for days, officials warned, as millions of Americans remained under air pollution warnings. Across the eastern US residents were again urged to stay inside and limit or avoid outdoor activities on Thursday, as schools in some cities closed, sporting events were canceled and air travel was disrupted. Protesters are set to descend upon the White House on Thursday amid growing anger among climate activists at Joe Biden for allowing a controversial gas pipeline in Appalachia to be fast-tracked. Several hundred protesters are expected to demand Biden \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reclaim his climate legacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by blocking the Mountain Valley pipeline, a 300-mile pipeline that will bring fracked gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia. New York governor Kathy Hochul tweeted that from Thursday 1m N95 masks would be made available at state facilities. She also urged people living in the state to remain indoors. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it from me today, Maya Yang, as we close the blog. Thank you for following along. Here is a video of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiery address in parliament during which he slammed conservative opposition leader Pierre Poilievre for climate crisis inaction: President Joe Biden has asked transport secretary Pete Buttigieg to keep him informed about his progress on managing air traffic implications as a result of the worsening air quality, he announced on Thursday. Hundreds of flights have been delayed across the country as of Thursday afternoon due to poor visibility and smoke, according to FlightAware.com. Jean Bright, who is originally from the UK but now lives in Ottawa, told the Guardian that she can see blue sky in Arnprior today but adds the scale of the problem is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost incomprehensible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once fires get going, they are incredibly difficult to put out. There aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough fire fighters, pumpers, specialized gear, water bombers, not to mention road access into dense remote bush. Some small communities, around 2,000 people, have volunteer firefighters. And they are the lucky ones. There are few bush or logging roads, access is severely limited. The water bombers need a fair stretch of water such as a big lake to suck up water. They have been going full blast. The pilots also need a break as they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fly 24/7. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 With Canada currently fighting hundreds of wildfires in multiple provinces, the Guardian took a look at the small village of Lytton in British Columbia which in 2021 broke Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest temperature ever at 49.6C. Two days after the temperature skyrocketed to nearly 50C, a wildfire scorched the entire village. Here is the documentary the Guardian produced on Lytton and how its residents have been relying on a collective spirit to heal: Here is footage of the wildfires currently raging across British Columbia, Canada: With hundreds of forest fires spreading uncontrollably across the country, 3.8m hectares (or 9.4m acres) have already been burned, according to government ministers. New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health advisory has been extended until 11.59pm on Friday, 9 June, Mayor Eric Adams announced on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please continue to limit your outdoor activities and mask up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Massachusetts Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren has also chimed in on the climate change discussion as smoke from Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wildfires continue to spread across the US. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Extreme weather. Drought. Massive wildfires that destroy our air quality. Evidence of a climate crisis is all around us and Northeasterners can look no further than out their own windows to find it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Warren tweeted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to address this crisis head-on\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no more time to waste,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added. New Yorkers appeared to poke fun at the apocalyptic aesthetic that has engulfed the city in a dense yellow as a result of smoke drifting from Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wildfires. In one video posted onto Twitter, one resident appeared to carry a speaker blasting the soundtrack of Denis Villeneuve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2021 movie Dune, a science fiction epic set in a galactic desert. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d think it was the end of the world if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know abt dune,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one person replied. Another person wrote, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certified dune moment in New York rn.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd New pictures are coming through on the newswires of the wildfires currently burning across Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s multiple provinces including Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec: Mark Fischer, 58, an IT project manager from Royersford, Pennsylvania has shared with the Guardian the ways that the smokey haze has affected him. Fischer wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been fairly lucky that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been able to stay in the house since yesterday, apart from feeding the birds and taking out the trash. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only been outside for minutes at a time, but it was enough to irritate my eyes this morning. Not my breathing so much, because I kind of held my breath. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to risk it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve remained inside since yesterday. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m thankful we still have electricity and gas. This morning the sky had a surreal light salmon color, not as dramatic as the burnt orange from yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NYC photos. But the sun is breaking through now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to continue hearing from our readers in Canada and the US about the impact of wildfires and smoke. Please feel free to share your story below: Mary Yang is speaking to protesters in DC who oppose the Mountain Valley pipeline: Protesters outside the White House said the wildfires are an example of why dirty energy projects must not go ahead. Demonstrators said they were especially disappointed in Biden, who last week signed into law the Fiscal Responsibility Act to avert a first ever national default in a deal that included fast tracking the controversial pipeline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel like he stabbed us in the back, said Don Jones, who has lived in Southwest Virginia for 65 years and was sued by the company for refusing to allow construction on his family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s land. Jones and his wife have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fighting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against the pipeline since 2015, when they say construction began on their farmland in Giles County, Virginia. While no longer in use, the land has been in his family for seven generations, and Jones said he feels a need to protect it. Jones, who voted for Biden in 2020, said he no longer trusts the president and wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vote for him again. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unless he fixes this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It might be rural country, Appalachia, dirt people, whatever they might think of us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jones said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there are some pretty smart people. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked the land, they respect the land, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stewards of it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jones said the pipeline, which is set to cross streams and rivers, will harm access to clean water. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the ground,\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 said Jones, of the pipeline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hoping gas will never be able to fill it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to fight for the water,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yvette Jones, his wife of 38 years, added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have water, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mary Yang is reporting from a protest in Washington DC about the Mountain Valley pipeline: A couple hundred protesters gathered in front of the White House Thursday afternoon, most from Southwestern Virginia and West Virginia, who say they were impacted by the route of the Mountain Valley pipeline. As they gathered, the air quality in Washington was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very unhealthy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to the site airnow.com, due to smoke from the Canada wildfires. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Humanity has reached a breaking point,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one speaker said, addressing the group, adding that it was fitting that the earth was currently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on fire.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Protestors also called on Biden to declare a climate emergency, calling the hazy air \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toxic dust.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US president Joe Biden announced that he has dictated a national inter-agency fire center response to Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request for further assistance in fighting its wildfires. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dictated a national inter-agency fire center response to Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s request for additional fire fighters and the fire suppression assets such as air tankers. We already have 600 American firefighters on the ground,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told reporters on Thursday. Biden said that he will also send \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fire suppression assets, such as air tankers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help fight the wildfires. New York Republican representative Marc Molinaro told Fox News that it is too soon to start \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lecturing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about climate change as the smoke from the wildfires continue to shroud numerous east coast states. Speaking on Fox and Friends, Molinaro said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is little question that Canada needs to obviously focus on forest management but this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the moment to start lecturing people about the science of climate change. Right now it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about putting out a fire and keeping people safe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Code Purple air quality alert has been issued for Washington DC on Thursday. Code purple means that all groups should stay indoors for as much as possible and that those that must work outside should reduce their work if possible and also wear a high-quality mask such as an N95 or N95. Experts in Canada say the country is increasingly forced to grapple with two wildfire peaks as climate conditions continue to shift. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Typically, the peak of the wildfire season is often in the middle of the summer, not now. But we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had more area burn than any year since we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been keeping records. This has been an extraordinary start to the year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Paul Kovacs, the executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction at Western University. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But most years after this point in the year, it gets much worse, the fires really take off. And should that be what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coming next. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re very much on edge.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd More than half of the 414 fires burning from coast to coast are determined to be out of control said emergency preparedness minister Bill Blair. In Quebec, where more than 160 fires are burning and the smoke has pushed down into the United States prompting dozens of air quality warnings, the province\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier pleaded with residents to follow evacuation orders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put your life in danger,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd premier Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Legault said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we ask you to evacuate it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Already more than 11,000 people have been displaced by the wildfires and a record 457,000 hectares have burned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the history of (the agency) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nearly 50 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve surpassed the worst year on record,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Quebec natural resources minister Ma\u00c3\u00aft\u00c3\u00a9 Blanchette V\u00c3\u00a9zina told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a situation that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unprecedented.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Readers in Canada and the US have got in touch to describe how they have been affected from the smell of smoke to breathing particles in the air. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of gunk in the air\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I live right on the border with Ontario. The fires are in an adjoining county, Pontiac county. We were told to stay indoors and keep the windows closed, and if you must go out, be very careful and not exert yourself. This is a first in this area; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lived here for 29 years. My general feeling is that this is going to be the new normal actually. They say that wildfires are increasing throughout the whole world. And this is just one aspect of it. This has brought it home to us. Blue has returned to the sky but for the past few days, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been like pure grey, a slate grey, and extremely depressing. And there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of gunk in the air. I was wearing my mask outside. David Mills, Gatineau, Quebec, Canada Here is a satellite image depicting plumes of wildfire across North America: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Weather satellite data showed the plume travelling in a South-Easterly direction on the 6th and 7th of June. On the 7th, thunderstorms along the US Eastern Seaboard lofted smoke and gas into the stratosphere, while on the 8th the smoke itself prevented clouds from forming \u00e2\u20ac\u201c meaning that New York has a cloudless day even though visibility was extremely poor,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd write Simon Proud, a scientist affiliated with the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s National Centre for Earth Observation. In a tweet on Thursday, US vice-president Kamala Harris said that the Canadian wildfires and subsequent smoke haze shrouding many east coast states \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are intensifying because of the climate crisis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She added that the Biden-Harris administration was working closely alongside Canadian officials in response to the crisis. Speaking to reporters yesterday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the wildfires burning across Canada and the smoke spreading into the US is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yet another alarming example of the ways in which the climate crisis is disturbing our lives and our communities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US experienced its worst toxic air pollution from wildfire smoke in its recent recorded history on Wednesday, researchers have found, with people in New York exposed to levels of pollution more than five times above the national air quality standard. The rapid analysis of the extreme event, shared with the Guardian, found that smoke billowing south from forest fires in Canada caused Americans to suffer the worst day of average exposure to such pollution since a dataset on smoky conditions started in 2006. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the worst by far, I mean, Jesus, it was bad,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Marshall Burke, an environmental scientist at Stanford University who led the work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to believe to be honest, we had to quadruple check it to see if it was right. We have not seen events like this, or even close to this, on the east coast before. This is an historic event.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US Michigan representative Rashida Tlaib has called on Michigan residents to check on each other as Michigan continues to be shrouded in a thick layer of smoke. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thinking about all of our children and residents living with asthma + respiratory illnesses. This is so dangerous for them &amp; all of our communities who already live with poor air quality. This is going to make it worse. Please take time today and check in on your neighbors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she tweeted. On Wednesday morning, Detroit ranked second in the world for worst air quality, according to IQ air quality index. On Thursday morning, Detroit ranked 12th, with New York coming in at number one. Tlaib went on to tweet, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153None of us should have to fight to breathe clean air. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our right,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding that last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt ceiling deal which reduces environmental protections \u00e2\u20ac\u0153makes this worse.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has lashed out against Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s official conservative opposition, accusing him of refusing to put forward concrete plans to fight climate change. Speaking in parliament and gradually raising his voice, Trudeau said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the leader of the opposition to consider that the forest fires that are taking people from their communities and destroying their homes are a mere distraction\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6is shameful. The fact of the matter is, he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have anything to say about that because he refuses to put forward any real plan to fight against climate change and he does nothing but fight against our plan to fight against climate change. If he has a better plan, let him say it because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been waiting a long time for it! But he has no plan to fight climate change, he still questions whether it exists while Canada is burning!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fire department will be distributing N95 masks at multiple locations across all five boroughs, the city has announced. Each person will be limited to two masks. In an interview with Fox News, Steve Milloy, a member of then-president Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Environmental Protection Agency transition team, said the wildfire haze in New York City poses \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no health risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EPA research, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done lots of clinical research on asthmatics, on elderly asthmatics, on children, on elderly with heart disease. Not a cough or a wheeze out of any of them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The clip sparked angry responses from Twitter users who noted that extensive research shows air pollution can be deadly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Air pollution \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially fine particulates like in the smoke \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is responsible for millions of deaths annually,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nick Mark, a pulmonologist in Seattle, Washington, tweeted. Steve Milloy serves on the board of the climate-denying, Koch Brothers-backed think tank the Heartland Institute. He previously worked as director of external policy and strategy at Murray Energy Corp, a massive US coal corporation. Experts told the Guardian that children, people with chronic illnesses, and those of a lower socioeconomic class are especially at risk amid the intense air pollution, and that those who are affected should avoid the outdoors, don masks, and turn on air purifiers to stay safe. EPA, meanwhile, is encouraging affected Americans to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153protect your health when smoke is in the air\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A user on TikTok has shared a makeshift air purifier hack in which she tapes four filters together and attaches a box fan pointing upwards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m in the [Pacific northwest] and typically we have this issue every spring, summer, Cali-Canada fires destroy our air and this is what works for us\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It works for all types of things and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6will save your life with really smokey days,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. US president Joe Biden has spoken with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and offered to deploy all available federal firefighting assets. In a statement released on Wednesday, the White House announced that the Biden administration has offered additional support to respond to the wildfires currently burning across Canada. It went on to add: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The President has directed his team to deploy all available Federal firefighting assets that can rapidly assist in suppressing fires impacting Canadian and American communities. To date, the United States has deployed more than 600 U.S. firefighters and support personnel, and other firefighting assets to respond to the fires.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Both leaders have agreed to stay in close touch as the situation develops. US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has called on agriculture secretary Tom Vilsack to double the amount of people available to fight the effects of Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wildfires and to address air quality risks currently faced by millions of Americans, Reuters reports. New York City health officials have rolled out a list of safety measures to take as the city remains shrouded in a thick smokey haze. In addition to urging residents to wear high-quality masks such as N95s or KN95s, health officials are urging residents to keep windows closed, use an air purifier if possible, and if an air conditioner is on, to close to fresh air intake to prevent outdoor air from entering inside homes. As the US north-east grapples with smoke from Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wildfires, here are the latest images sent to us from the newswires: Toxic smoke from Canadian wildfires could linger over vast swathes of the US for days, officials warned, as millions of Americans remained under air pollution warnings. Across the eastern US residents were again urged to stay inside and limit or avoid outdoor activities on Thursday, as schools in some cities closed, sporting events were canceled, and air travel was disrupted. Smoke from wildfires in Canada has been moving south into the US since May. Hundreds of fires are burning in Canada, from the western provinces to Nova Scotia and Quebec in the east, where there are more than 150 active fires in a particularly fierce start to the summer season. The weather system driving the smoke south \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will probably be hanging around at least for the next few days,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bryan Ramsey, a US National Weather Service meteorologist, told the Associated Press. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Conditions are likely to remain unhealthy, at least until the wind direction changes or the fires get put out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ramsey said. Caitlin Alicia Marshall, a 21-year-old violin performance student living in New York, told the Guardian: I was out for two hours in the city on Tuesday and came back home with a very sore throat and itchy eyes. My boyfriend rushed to buy an air purifier to use at home whilst I taped the windows shut. The purifier indicated that even the air inside our apartment was dangerously affected. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave the apartment on Wednesday out of fear it will cause us health issues down the line. Protesters are set to descend upon the White House on Thursday amid growing anger among climate activists at Joe Biden for allowing a controversial gas pipeline in Appalachia to be fast-tracked. Several hundred protesters are expected to demand Biden \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reclaim his climate legacy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by blocking the Mountain Valley pipeline, a 300-mile pipeline that will bring fracked gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia. Organizers said they had ordered N95 masks to help protect protesters amid the air quality alerts linked to the Canadian wildfires. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be risking arrest under skies filled with smoke from wildfires fueled by the growing climate crisis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said organizer Jamie Henn of Fossil Free Media. The Mountain Valley pipeline project has been enmeshed in legal challenges for years due to opposition from grassroots groups and landowners but the deal passed by Congress to raise the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debt ceiling. The expediting of the pipeline provoked outrage from activists as well as some Democratic allies of Biden, with Tim Kaine, the senator from Virginia, complaining that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strongly opposes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the decision to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153green-light this pipeline without normal administrative and judicial review and ignore the voices of Virginians\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The project will lead to between 6m and 89m tons of extra planet-heating emissions should it go ahead, depending on conflicting estimates as to its impact. Norwegian officials say the smoke from Canadian wildfires that has enveloped parts of the US and Canada in a thick haze is expected to pour into Norway. Atmosphere and climate scientists with the Norwegian Climate and Environmental Research Institute used a forecast model to predict how the smoke would travel through the atmosphere. The independent research institution says the smoke has moved over Greenland and Iceland since 1 June, and observations in southern Norway have recorded increasing concentrations of aerosolized particles. A senior researcher says Norwegians might be able to see some haze or smell smoke on Thursday but that the concentration of particles isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expected to pose health hazards. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing wildfire season is a harbinger of our climate future, experts and officials say. The fires are a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153really clear sign of climate change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Mohammadreza Alizadeh, a researcher at McGill University in Montreal, who is also a postdoctoral associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Research shows that climate change has already exacerbated wildfires dramatically. A 2021 study supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association found that climate change has been the main driver of the increase in hot, dry fire weather in the western US. By 2090, global wildfires are expected to increase in intensity by up to 57% thanks to climate change, a United Nations report warned last year. On air quality maps, purple signifies the worst of it. In reality, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a thick, hazardous haze that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disrupting daily life for millions of people across the US and Canada, blotting out skylines and turning skies orange, the AP writes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more: The smoky blanket billowing from wildfires in Quebec and Nova Scotia and sending plumes of fine particulate matter as far away as North Carolina and northern Europe. With the weather not expected to shift, this could persist into Thursday and possibly the weekend. That means at least another day, or more, of a dystopian-style detour that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chased players from ballfields, actors from Broadway stages, delayed thousands of flights and sparked a resurgence in mask wearing and remote work \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all while raising concerns about the health effects of prolonged exposure to such bad air. We have been asking Guardian readers to tell how they are dealing with the fires in Canada and the ensuing smoke. Phil Clark, who lives in Barrie, Ontario, wrote in to tell us what the situation was like where he is. On Wednesday, he wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the last three days we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a haze (note that these fires are over a thousand kilometres away). Today is the worst day. Though there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no cloud, the sun is not at all bright.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The FAA has now also paused flights from the north-east, mid-Atlantic and Ohio going to Philadelphia airport. The agency cited low visibility for the delay in air traffic. A video of the George Washington Bridge connecting New Jersey and New York City this morning gives an idea of how low visibility really is. Millions of people across North America woke up to orange skies and a smoky haze as air quality alerts continued across the US and Canada. People were urged to mask up to protect their lungs from breathing in too much polluted air. New York governor Kathy Hochul tweeted that from Thursday 1m N95 masks would be made available at state facilities. She also urged people living in the state to remain indoors: Media reports said the smog was expected to spread beyond New York to other east coast areas. Toxic air was also being reported in Philadelphia and other parts of Pennsylvania. Large swathes of the midwest and the south also faced air quality alerts. Hundreds of uncontrolled forest fires have spread across Canada, threatening critical infrastructure and forcing evacuations. Wildfires are common in the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s western provinces, but this year flames have rapidly spread towards the east. About 3.8m hectares (9.4m acres) have already burned, according to government ministers. The wildfires have created a blanket of smoke that has spread across several US cities, including New York, forcing residents to stay indoors. Hello and welcome to our live blog focusing on the wildfires ravaging Canada and the impact smoke from those blazes is having across the northern US. Forest fires continued to burn across Canada on Thursday as the country endured its worst-ever start to wildfire season, forcing thousands of people from their homes. In New York, authorities temporarily halted flights from the north-east, Ohio and Mid-Atlantic bound for LaGuardia Airport. The FAA said on Thursday wildfire smoke from Canada was reducing visibility and impacting US flights. The agency said it would likely need to take further steps to address traffic into New York City, Washington, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/08/cricket-ben-stokes-test-must-become-more-exciting-survive", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEmbrace it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Stokes says Test cricket must become more exciting to survive", "lead": "The England captain, Ben Stokes, has urged administrators to stop trying to fight change in order to ensure young players are still interested in Test cricket", "author": "Guardian sport", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T21:22:40Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896992", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/bd39e6499da870fde75ae5171511a6649d23cc87/0_14_3818_2292/500.jpg", "body": "The England captain, Ben Stokes, has urged administrators to make Test cricket more attractive and exciting to ensure that the sport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brightest talents aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lured away by more lucrative alternatives. A decline in the popularity of Test cricket, combined with the rising influence and financial power of overseas franchise leagues such as the IPL, has triggered anxiety about the future of the format. Last month, the English and Wales Cricket Board admitted that franchise leagues posed a threat to its future. But Stokes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who, along with England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head coach, Brendon McCullum, has been responsible for implementing a bolder, more aggressive approach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c insisted in an article for the Players\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Tribune that Test cricket could still be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the pinnacle of the sport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if those who run the game embrace change rather than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fight against it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a leader, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not much of a writer and, to be honest, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak for long periods in the dressing room,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m more a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crack on, lads\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, lead-by-example guy. But I am clear on what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to do here, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at stake, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bigger than just myself and my own ambitions on the field. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about inspiring the next generation of players. And that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just mean kids like I was, but also the up-and-coming crop of players who are already here and making the big decisions about their careers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Referring to the competition from other formats and franchise leagues, Stokes added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The landscape is changing. Cricket as a sport is evolving in a huge way. Faster than it ever has before. Formats like T20, The Hundred and ODIs are bringing money and opportunities for players that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist even 15 years ago.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I was growing up there was no greater privilege than to represent your country in a Test match \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and I still believe that, by the way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not naive. Cricketers have short careers and I know players are going to make decisions about which route they go down based on financial security for them and their families. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I really want boards across the world to get their heads around this, which they seem to be having a hard time doing. Rather than fight against it, we need to embrace it. Yes, we may lose a few talented players along the way, but the best way to keep Test cricket alive and at the pinnacle of the sport is to work harder to show players something that excites them and inspires them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although Stokes did not bowl during England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent commanding Test victory against Ireland, he is adamant he will be ready for the first Ashes showdown against Australia on 16 June. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m building myself up and bowling in the warm-up before the start of play was a first step,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m happy with it, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just keep building it up now before Edgbaston.

From contraception to HPV vaccines to the politics of pain relief in childbirth, much of what many of us \u00e2\u20ac\u0153know\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd comes from old wives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tales, fleeting appointments with GPs or advice from tipsy aunts. For every enlightened pal who lets you know some side-effects your doctor didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention, there is an equally ill-informed Twitter account broadcasting that the morning-after pill leaves you infertile or the pill increases the chances of your child having ADHD. With such sophistry and illusion around the facts, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ample space for terrible \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wellness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd advice, such as blaming cramps on Mercury being in retrograde or Gwyneth Paltrow selling jade eggs to insert into your vagina to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153balance hormones\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Snake oil and other potentially harmful alternative treatments can get more traction when the side-effects of progesterone are ill-researched, black women are four times more likely to die during childbirth than their white counterparts and waiting lists for Mirena coils are, as this programme tells us, up to a year long. I remember sitting in the same room as another young mother, each doing our postpartum health centre visits, and hearing the copper coil and the Mirena coil explained to her as exactly the same. As a long-term Mirena coil user, who at one point had periods so agonising my vision would blur, I wanted to scream to her: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One will probably make your periods lighter or disappear and the other will likely make them heavier and more painful!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are reasons to go with a copper coil, but there are significant differences that are outlined in detail by one of the nurses interviewed by Davina McCall in this documentary. Unlike her, I kept this information to myself and said nothing to the stranger. Now, years later, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but imagine how justifiably angry she would feel watching Davina McCall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pill Revolution. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a one-off documentary looking at the current state of contraception in the UK. McCall had a terrible time on the pill herself as a teenager, and having seen one daughter go through something similar while her other daughter was absolutely fine, she investigates just what choices are available to us, why the information about them is so unreliable and why accessing the best options for our physical and mental health is a minefield. McCall talks to medical experts, politicians, researchers and regular people about the consequences of contraception. Even though many of them give hugely helpful information, and McCall goes so far as to be filmed having her own Mirena coil replaced on camera \u00e2\u20ac\u201c talking us through the experience including the brief moments of discomfort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are still glaring holes in the research that she cannot compensate for. McCall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doctor explains that there is only limited research on the side-effects for some contraceptives \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from weight gain to loss of libido to volatile mood swings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as they are regarded as acceptable consequences for women to endure for birth control. The documentary features some heartbreaking testimony from those who started the pill only to be overcome by depression, leaving their relationships and careers in disarray. Others who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bear it any longer resorted to unreliable fertility tracking apps, which led to unwanted pregnancies. In the middle of a mental health crisis, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shocking to hear how little we know about the ramifications of these medications on depression and anxiety when these people can testify to these drugs causing a seismic shift in their mental state. Unlike in Europe, the doctor explains that women in the UK have to work the system if they want to be prescribed anything other than the cheapest contraception (the combined pill microgynon) and to get an alternative, such as a coil, an implant or simply a different pill. While NHS doctors can prescribe the Mirena coil as a treatment for painful periods, they tell McCall that they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it simply because a patient wants effective contraception. These hard-to-swallow truths are ones that Pill Revolution tries to present in as palatable a way as possible. McCall is as charming and smiley as ever, at one point donning a sparkly red gown to create a camp, miniature gameshow within the programme. There are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true or false\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rounds about popular contraception myths and a spinning roulette wheel where literal guinea pigs get to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153win\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the many possible symptoms from taking the pill. But McCall also demonstrates her skill as an interviewer capable of shifting into a more serious mode. When she meets Maria Caulfield, the minister for women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health strategy, she holds her to account. The minister comes off as defensive and keen to spin the appearance into a showcase of her plan to fund women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health hubs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where contraception advice and treatments will be available \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and assure McCall that \u00c2\u00a325m has been allocated to make this a reality. McCall responds firmly: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That sounds like a lot of money, but when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve cut a billion pounds from health, and lots of that would have been used for sexual and reproductive health, putting \u00c2\u00a325m back in, it feels like a drop in the ocean.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As she leaves the interview, McCall is noticeably deflated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one step forward after many steps backwards.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There are some glaring gaps in the narrative. Class, race and disability aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really broached when it comes to access and care. Nor does the programme dive into the fact that some of the issues around contraception access are rooted in a desire to suppress women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sexual freedom. But it is still a powerful documentary that will leave many viewers making more informed decisions about their bodies, saving them from pain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and potentially saving lives as well. And if the woman from the health centre is reading this, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yell. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Davina McCall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pill Revolution was on Channel 4 and is available on More4"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-cooling-pond-at-zaporizhzhia-plant-at-risk-after-dam-collapse-report", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Ukraine: cooling pond at Zaporizhzhia plant at risk after dam collapse \u00e2\u20ac\u201c report ", "lead": "Nuclear safety organisation says loss of pool would not necessarily be catastrophic, but would dramatically increase safety concerns", "author": "Julian Borger in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T20:43:02Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.896997", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/80c8f925f31526cd6deb9fbee0ce0fcede0747d4/0_192_2560_1536/500.jpg", "body": "The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. Without the reservoir on the other side to counteract it, the internal pressure of the water in the cooling pool could breach the dyke around it, a report by the Paris-based Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said. The loss of the pool would not necessarily be catastrophic as other sources of water could be brought in, such as pumping trucks, to prevent a meltdown of the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear fuel, but a loss of the cooling pool would dramatically increase safety concerns at the plant. Officials at the Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, said that any collapse of the dyke around the cooling pond would be partial even in a worst-case scenario and that there would still be sufficient water to keep reactor cores and spent fuel cool, but they warned of the dangers of sabotage by Russian forces who are occupying the plant. Since the collapse of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday, its reservoir has been draining into the Dnipro River and the Black Sea beyond, and will soon drop below the water intakes used to pump water into an array of spray ponds that are used to cool the reactor cores and spent fuel at the site and the much bigger cooling pool used as a water reserve. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are reaching this dead zone, which is 12.70 [metres], after which there will not be any water intake either for the cooling ponds at the Zaporizhzhia station,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhydroenergo, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hydro power corporation, said on Thursday. In the wake of the dam disaster, for which Ukraine, the UN, EU and other world leaders are holding Russia responsible, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, warned that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it is vital that this cooling pond remains intact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. He later added that water from the Kakhovka reservoir was still being pumped to the power plant to cool reactors and other areas, though levels are at values earlier thought to make it impossible. The plant can also rely on a large cooling pond above the reservoir with several months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of water, Grossi said. The IRSN report suggests that the integrity of the dyke around the pond could be in danger of collapse even without Russian sabotage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A drop in the Dnipro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water level could lead to basin leakage, or even to the collapse of the surrounding dyke, due to the pressure exerted by the water contained in the basin,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said. It added that Energoatom had conducted stress tests after the Fukushima nuclear disaster following a tsunami in 2011. Those tests, it said, estimated that the dike can \u00e2\u20ac\u0153withstand a Dnipro level of 10 metres in the vicinity of the power plant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This water level and the watertightness of the retention basin will be closely monitored over the coming days,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the report said. Karine Herviou, the IRSN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cooling needs are limited and could be met by other means. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Herviou told the Guardian. Asked about the IRSN report, an Energoatom official said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the water level in the Kakhovka reservoir drops to less than 10 metres, the dam on the cooling pond may collapse, but not completely. Only the upper part may collapse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But even then, the amount of water that will remain will be enough to keep the plant in a cold mode.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The president of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said on Thursday that the current water supply at Zaporizhzhia is enough \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to keep the nuclear power plant in a safe mode of operation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but warned of the threat of Russian sabotage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The very fact that the Russians blew up the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station demonstrates that the Russians have no qualms about creating man-made disasters on earth,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kotin said in an interview on Ukrainian television. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They can do the same on the territory of Zaporizhzhya NPP [nuclear power plant].

The allegation, described in a letter filed under seal with the chief US judge in Washington, James Boasberg, could affect the investigation just as prosecutors are considering whether to bring charges. Even though prosecutors have no control over the success of judicial applications, the fact that it was raised in the context of trying to persuade a lawyer for a witness to recommend cooperating could give the appearance of coercion in one of the justice department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most high-profile cases. At issue is an incident that took place last year, around November, when prosecutors were trying to gain the cooperation of valet Walt Nauta, who has been under scrutiny because prosecutors suspected he helped the former president conceal classified documents that had been subpoenaed. Nauta had already spoken to prosecutors in the investigation when they called his lawyer Stanley Woodward and summoned him to a meeting at justice department headquarters for an urgent matter that they were reluctant to discuss over the phone, the letter said. When Woodward arrived at the conference room, he was seated across from several prosecutors working on the investigation, including the chief of the counterintelligence section, Jay Bratt, who explained that they wanted Nauta to cooperate with the government against Trump, the letter said. Nauta should cooperate with the government because he had given potentially conflicting testimony that could result in a false statements charge, the prosecutors said according to the letter. Woodward is said to have demurred, disputing that Nauta had made false statements. Bratt then turned to Woodward and remarked that he did not think that Woodward was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump guy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153he would do the right thing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, before noting that he knew Woodward had submitted an application to be a judge at the superior court in Washington DC that was currently pending, the letter said. The allegation, in essence, is that Bratt suggested Woodward\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judicial application might be considered more favorably if he and his client cooperated against Trump. The letter was filed after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers submitted a motion on Monday seeking grand jury transcripts, because of what they viewed as potential misconduct. The justice department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s characterization of the meeting is unclear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a spokesperson declined to comment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though a more innocent explanation for the exchange could be, for instance, that Bratt was genuinely surprised to see the application and raised it as an aside. Prosecutors also regularly collect background information about lawyers they meet with, including prior interactions with the justice department and cases they have argued, and it is not unusual for them to make small talk with defense lawyers about other projects they are involved in. The extent of any potential impact to the case is similarly unclear, since it does not appear to have directly affected any testimony Nauta gave to prosecutors, and Bratt would not have the ability to influence such an application, which is handled by the White House counsel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, it would not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd former US attorney Joyce Vance said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prosecutors don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any influence over judicial applications and all the parties to the conversation would have known that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But the exchange is said to have unnerved Woodward, who recounted the exchange to associates after leaving the meeting. He also promptly informed the justice department at the time they would have no further communications unless Nauta was getting charged or an immunity deal. The development comes as prosecutors formally told Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers last week that the former president had been designated a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153target\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the criminal investigation into his handling of national security information and obstruction of justice, the Guardian previously reported. The move \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the clearest sign yet that Trump is on course to be indicted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dramatically raises the stakes for Trump, as the investigation nears its conclusion after taking evidence before a grand jury in Washington and a previously unknown grand jury in Florida. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers were sent a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153target letter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd days before they met on Monday with the special counsel and the senior career official in the deputy attorney general\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office, where they asked prosecutors not to charge the former president in part because of potential misconduct. The development comes as prosecutors have obtained evidence of criminal conduct occurring at Mar-a-Lago and decided that any indictments should be charged in the southern district of Florida, where the resort is located, rather than in Washington, according to people familiar with the matter. To that end, prosecutors last month started issuing subpoenas to multiple Trump aides that compelled them to testify before a new grand jury in Florida, impaneled around the time that the grand jury in Washington stopped taking new evidence, the Guardian previously reported."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/09/morning-mail-innocent-children-pleading-guilty-renters-face-new-hurdle-france-stabbing-attack", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Morning Mail: innocent children pleading guilty, renters face new hurdle, France stabbing attack", "lead": "Young people are admitting crimes they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit to avoid Queensland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s harsh bail laws; housing pressures ramp up for renters; children wounded in French playground attack", "author": "Paul Gallagher", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T20:36:01Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897002", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/515d360549a8de04b59f98ab2c2a9438e2ca2d32/0_125_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Good morning.

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re closing this blog now and will start afresh on Friday. We have stand alone stories on some of the biggest news of the day, links in the bullet points below. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where things stand: Donald Trump has asked a federal court in New York to slash the $5m penalty awarded against him in the sexual assault and defamation civil case won by writer E Jean Carroll down to just $1m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or grant him a new trial. The White House has had to postpone a party due for this evening, where thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer-plus (LGBTQ+) people were invited to a celebration and, essentially, a political defiance event. Reuters further reports that Biden said violence against LGBTQ+ people in the United States is on the rise and anti-LGBTQ rhetoric is an appeal to fear that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unjustified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ugly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hardline Republicans have effectively paralyzed the chamber because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unhappy at speaker Kevin McCarthy over the deal with Democrats that resolved the problem with the US debt ceiling. The spat appears to have widened to envelop No 2 House Republican Steve Scalise, who appears unhappy with the speaker. The US supreme court ruled that Alabama discriminated against Black voters when it drew its seven congressional districts last year. The ruling in Allen v Milligan means that Alabama will have to draw its congressional map afresh to include a second majority-Black district. Donald Trump has asked a federal court in New York to slash the $5m penalty awarded against him in the sexual assault and defamation civil case won by writer E Jean Carroll down to just $1m \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or grant him a new trial. The case went in Carroll\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favor last month when a jury decided that Trump had sexually abused and defamed her. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal team has argued to the court that the damages awarded against him are excessive and the court should either slash them or allow a new trial. Reuters adds: The lawyers noted in a written submission that a Manhattan federal court jury last month rejected a rape claim made by the writer, E. Jean Carroll, concluding instead that she had been sexually abused in spring 1996 in the store\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dressing room. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such abuse could have included groping of Plaintiff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s breasts through clothing, or similar conduct, which is a far cry from rape,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the lawyers wrote. They said the $2 million granted by the jury on a sexual abuse claim was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grossly excessive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and another $2.7 million issued for compensatory defamation damages was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153based upon pure speculation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The award should consist of no more than $400,000 for sex abuse, no more than $100,000 for defamation and $368,000 or less for the cost of a campaign to repair Carroll\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs reputation, the lawyers wrote. If a judge does not grant the suggested reduction in the award, then he should permit a new trial on damages, they said. Roberta Kaplan, Carroll\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney, said in an emailed statement that the arguments by Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyers were frivolous. She said the unanimous jury had concluded that Trump sexually assaulted Carroll and then defamed her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by lying about her with hatred, ill-will, or spite.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This time, Trump will not be able to escape the consequences of his actions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kaplan said. Trump may still face a second defamation trial resulting from another lawsuit Carroll filed against him. That case has been delayed with appeals as the U.S. Justice Department sought to substitute the United States as the defendant in place of Trump. Government lawyers say Trump can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be held liable for the comments he made as president. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New York civil rights campaigner and politician Al Sharpton on the supreme court decision. This was an unexpected decision that hopefully means the Supreme Court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s era of disenfranchising voters is coming to an end. Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gerrymandering policies were quintessential, modern-day Jim Crow tactics to suppress Black voters in the state. That you had two conservative-leaning judges rule against the state all but confirms that. This is a major step forward in the fight to protect voting rights. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not forget that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in this mess because the Supreme Court took a sledgehammer to the Voting Rights Act a decade ago when it ruled on Shelby v. Holder. States essentially got the green light to recut lines, purge voter rolls, and take any other steps to keep Black and Brown Americans from showing up at the polls. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling only goes to show why Congress has a moral imperative to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act this year. We have been promised since we lost John Lewis three years ago, amid historic protests against racial injustice, and we will not wait until next year when lawmakers need our vote again. On August 26th, we will gather for the 60th Anniversary of the March on Washington to send a clear message that this legislation must pass now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US attorney general Merrick Garland has issued a response to the supreme court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on Alabama and also a fresh call to the US Congress to pass some of the voting rights legislation that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaigned on in 2020 but is growing mildew on Capitol Hill. Garland said: Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision rejects efforts to further erode fundamental voting rights protections, and preserves the principle that in the United States, all eligible voters must be able to exercise their constitutional right to vote free from discrimination based on their race. The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, the right from which all other rights ultimately flow. Over the past two years, the Justice Department has rededicated its resources to enforcing federal voting rights protections. We will continue to use every authority we have left to defend voting rights. But that is not enough. We urge Congress to act to provide the Department with important authorities it needs to protect the voting rights of every American.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Janai Nelson, president and director- counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF), on the Scotus decision. There is praise to go around. On Deuel Ross, racial justice attorney at the Legal Defense Fund: More reaction now to the surprise decision by the US supreme court earlier to defend the Voting Rights Act in a case involving Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electoral map. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has released a statement thus, which includes some useful background: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled in Allen v. Milligan in favor of Black voters who challenged Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2021-enacted congressional map for violating the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for diluting Black political power, affirming the district court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s order that Alabama redraw its congressional map. By packing and cracking the historic Black Belt community, the map passed by the state legislature allowed Black voters an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice in only one of seven districts even though they make up 27 percent percent of the voting-age population. In its decision, the court also affirmed that under Section 2 of the VRA, race can be used in the redistricting process to provide equal opportunities to communities of color and ensure they are not packed and cracked in a way that impermissibly weakens their voting strength. The case was brought in November 2021 on behalf of Evan Milligan, Khadidah Stone, Letetia Jackson, Shalela Dowdy, Greater Birmingham Ministries, and the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP who are represented by the Legal Defense Fund (LDF), American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Alabama, Hogan Lovells LLP, and Wiggins, Childs, Pantazis, Fisher &amp; Goldfarb. It was argued before the court on Oct. 4, 2022. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision is a crucial win against the continued onslaught of attacks on voting rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said LDF senior counsel Deuel Ross, who argued the case before the court in October. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alabama attempted to rewrite federal law by saying race had no place in redistricting. But because of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sordid and well-documented history of racial discrimination, race must be used to remedy that past and ensure communities of color are not boxed out of the electoral process. While the Voting Rights Act and other key protections against discriminatory voting laws have been weakened in recent years and states continue to pass provisions to disenfranchise Black voters, today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision is a recognition of Section 2\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s purpose to prevent voting discrimination and the very basic right to a fair shot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Davin Rosborough, senior staff attorney with the ACLU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Voting Rights Project, said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Supreme Court rejected the Orwellian idea that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inappropriate to consider race in determining whether racial discrimination led to the creation of illegal maps. This ruling is a huge victory for Black Alabamians.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a busy morning in US politics and there will be plenty more developments on subjects ranging from Trump and E Jean Carroll to the supreme court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise ruling on Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s biased voting maps. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where things stand: Donald Trump has asked for a new trial in the civil case brought by author E Jean Carroll, in which a Manhattan jury last month found the former US president liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer and awarded her $5m in damages. The White House has had to postpone a party due for this evening, where thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer-plus (LGBTQ+) people were invited to a celebration and, essentially, a political defiance event. Hardline Republicans have effectively paralyzed the chamber because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unhappy at speaker Kevin McCarthy over the deal with Democrats that resolved the problem with the US debt ceiling. The spat appears to have widened to envelop No 2 House Republican Steve Scalise, who appears unhappy with the speaker. The US supreme court ruled that Alabama discriminated against Black voters when it drew its seven congressional districts last year. The ruling in Allen v Milligan means that Alabama will have to draw its congressional map afresh to include a second majority-Black district. Another quick reminder that British prime minister Rishi Sunak and US president Joe Biden are about to hold a press conference at the White House. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beginning any moment and our London colleagues are glued to it. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a live feed and all the developments as they happen, via the UK politics blog, here. No sooner had a New York jury found for E Jean Carroll than Donald Trump verbally attacked her during a live town hall-style interview on CNN (the broadcast which was probably the penultimate nail in the coffin for departing CNN chair Chris Licht before the crushing Atlantic article). Carroll promptly went back to court to to demand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very substantial\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd additional damages from Trump for the disparaging remarks, filing an amended lawsuit seeking an additional $10m in compensatory damages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and more in punitive damages. During the town hall in New Hampshire the day after the 9 May verdict, Trump further and repeatedly demeaned Carroll and her experiences. Trump said her account of a sexual assault, in the case which he is appealing, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fake\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made-up story\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and referred to it as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hanky-panky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He repeated past claims that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d never met Carroll and considered her a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whack job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The filing by Carroll the following week claimed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements at the televised town hall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153show the depth of his malice toward Carroll, since it is hard to imagine defamatory conduct that could possibly be more motivated by hatred, ill will or spite\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Now Trump wants a new trial. Last month a New York jury found that Donald Trump sexually abused the former advice columnist, E Jean Carroll, in one of New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most upscale stores, in the changing room at Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue, 27 years ago. The verdict on 9 May, for the first time, essentially legally branded a former US president as a sexual predator. It was the result of a civil not criminal case, and the only legal sanction Trump faced was financial. At the time, my colleagues Chris McGreal and Martin Pengelly noted that: In explaining a finding of sexual abuse to the jury, the judge said it had two elements: that Trump subjected Carroll to sexual contact without consent by use of force, and that it was for the purpose of sexual gratification. The jury deliberated for less than three hours. It did not find Trump raped Carroll, but did find him liable for sexual abuse. It awarded about $5m in compensatory and punitive damages: about $2m on the sexual abuse count and close to $3m for defamation, for branding her a liar. In an interview the following day, Carroll said she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153overwhelmed with joy for the women in this country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It would be staggering if Donald Trump succeeded in getting a new civil trial in the issues brought against him by E Jean Carroll, after she sued him for defamation and sexual abuse and won hands down after a brisk jury decision. But the former US president is having a go. Donald Trump has asked for a new trial in the civil case brought by author E Jean Carroll, in which a Manhattan jury last month found the former US president liable for sexually abusing and defaming the writer and awarded her $5m in damages, Reuters reports. This according to a new court filing. More on this asap. Smoke gets in your eyes. Sadly, the White House has had to postpone a party due for this evening at the White House, where thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer-plus (LGBTQ+) people were invited to a celebration and, essentially, a political defiance event at the White House. The smoky air drifting south from the Canadian wildfires that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been causing havoc on the eastern seaboard and further inland has put paid to tonight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party. BUT in better news, it is currently rescheduled for Saturday. NBC reports that the event was/is designed as: A high-profile show of support at a time when the community feels under attack like never before and the White House has little recourse to beat back a flood of state-level legislation against them. Biden is also announcing new initiatives to protect LGBTQ+ communities from attacks, help youth with mental health resources and homelessness and counter book bans, White House officials said. The event is a: Picnic featuring food, games, face painting and photos. Queen HD the DJ was handling the music; singer Betty Who was on tap to perform. Karine Jean-Pierre, the first openly gay White House press secretary, said Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses are strong supporters of the LGBTQ+ community and think that having a celebration is an important way to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lift up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd their accomplishments and contributions. She said LGBTQ+ people need to know that Biden \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has their back\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will continue to fight for them. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the message that we want to make sure that gets out there.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd FYI Harris is in the Bahamas today on business and is expected back in DC tonight. Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting Rishi Sunak at the White House and holding a presser soon. You can follow all the latest developments on the Canadian wildfires and the smoke impact on the US in our dedicated live blog: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some context on the relationship between House speaker Kevin McCarthy and his chamber GOP No. 2, Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, from the Punchbowl report, prior to the hardliners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 spat now rippling out on Capitol Hill. The outlet points out that a captain having friction with his supposed wingman \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is a tale as old as time in House leadership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and these two have known each other for decades. Punchbowl reports: The pair met as young College Republicans and their interactions have always been professional. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no doubt some bad blood between the two men. Scalise considered running against McCarthy for Republican leader in 2019, but ultimately decided against it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d something we cataloged at length in a book we wrote. And again, McCarthy tapped [Louisiana congressman Garrett] Graves and [North Carolina congressman Patrick] McHenry for the most sensitive negotiations of the last few months, leaving Scalise aside. Scalise said in the interview that McCarthy is still viable as speaker of the House. But the House majority leader noted repeatedly that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of anger on a lot of sides of our conference.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An old article from Politico notes that McCarthy and Scalise\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parallel rise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd dates to the late 1990s. McCarthy was national chairman of the Young Republicans and Scalise was an up and coming Louisiana politician and their friendship developed from that time. British prime minister Rishi Sunak, from the Conservative Party, is in Washington DC, this week and is meeting right now with Joe Biden at the White House. The premier and the US president are due to hold a press conference at 1.30pm US east coast time. Our colleagues in London are focusing on this and will be covering it as it happens via the UK politics blog, with a live stream of the event. You can keep up with that blog here. Selma native and Alabama congresswoman Terri Sewell just hopped on the phone for a live interview with CNN on air to express her relief and delight about the supreme court decision on voting rights and the relevant district maps in her state. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is so exciting, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really amazing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an amazing victory for Alabama Black voters, for the Voting Rights Act, for democracy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. She tweeted about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153historic victory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sewell said the ruling reflected the legacy of the long legacy of fighting for civil rights for Black voters in Alabama and elsewhere and she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reeling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the good surprise. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And to have the supreme court give us this huge win, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told CNN. She noted this would have implications more widely and was a closely watched case by legislatures creating voting maps, especially in states such as North Carolina and Ohio. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Everyone is looking at this decision,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said, adding \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it will have a positive ripple effect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She noted that the late civil rights activist, champion and congressman John Lewis \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must be smiling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that those who challenged Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s discriminatory voting rights did was Lewis always encouraged people do to: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we got into some good trouble.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is Sewell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pinned tweet: While we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been focusing on the supreme court this morning, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also been watching developments in the House of Representatives. Hardline Republicans have effectively paralyzed the chamber because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unhappy at speaker Kevin McCarthy over the deal with Democrats that raised the US debt ceiling. The spat appears to have widened to envelop No 2 House Republican Steve Scalise, who appears not too happy himself at his boss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct, Punchbowl reports. According to the site, which spoke to Scalise late yesterday, he was left out of negotiations over the deal itself, which 71 Republicans voted against, and the horse trading with the hardliners that resulted in McCarthy finally winning the gavel after a marathon 15 rounds of voting back in January. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Scalise told Punchbowl: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what the promises were. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t part of that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so I still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what those agreements were. Whatever they are, [conservatives] feel that the agreements were broken. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got to get resolved. Hopefully it does. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t present a picture of harmony between the chamber\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top two Republicans, which the rightwingers might try to exploit as they continue to keep the House at an impasse. All voting has been postponed until next week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a small group of people who are pissed off that are keeping the House of Representatives from functioning,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Arkansas Republican representative Steve Womack said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is insane. This is not the way a governing majority is expected to behave, and frankly, I think there will be a political cost to it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Read more: There are no more supreme court decisions to come today, leaving about two dozen cases still to be resolved in the final weeks of the session, which is scheduled to end later this month. The next \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decision day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be next Thursday, 15 June. Conservative supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh joining his liberal colleagues, and the chief justice John Roberts, in the voting rights ruling condemning Alabama, is raising eyebrows. Kavanaugh was the deciding voice in the surprising 5-4 ruling that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being seen as a huge victory for the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Kavanaugh agreed that Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drawing of seven congressional districts last year, largely affecting Black voters, was a violation of Section 2 of the act. According to Scotusblog, he says courts should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153generally not overrule statutes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for Congress to do\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Unsurprisingly, the other conservative judges Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, dissented. Gorsuch was the most vocal, declaring that the decision \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unnecessarily sets the VRA on a perilous and unfortunate path\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The case reached the supreme court after a three-judge federal court panel blocked the Republican-drawn map in 2022 as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153substantially likely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd violation of Section 2 and ordered an additional district where Black voters make up \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a voting-age majority or something quite close to it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ruling bucks recent supreme court trends in voting rights cases involving race, Reuters reports. In 2013 it ruled in another Alabama to strike down determining which states with histories of racial discrimination needed federal approval to change voting laws. In a 2021 ruling it endorsed Republican-backed Arizona voting restrictions, making it harder to prove violations under Section 2. In the biggest ruling of the day so far, the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liberal justices have joined chief justice John Roberts in calling Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Republican redrawn electoral maps as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153discriminatory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big win for voting rights advocates. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson sided with Roberts, and conservative Brett Kavanaugh joined most of the ruling. Alabama discriminated against Black voters when it drew its seven congressional districts last year. The ruling in Allen v Milligan means that Alabama will have to draw its congressional map to include a second majority-Black district. Black voters currently comprise a majority of the voting age population in just one district, despite making up a quarter of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ruling in full. And read my colleague Sam Levine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report here: Whiskey, and dog chew toys resembling iconic bottles of Jack Daniel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, is on the menu as the second ruling of the day. The whiskey maker alleged that the dog toy maker, VIP Products, both \u00e2\u20ac\u0153infringed and diluted its trademark\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The court says that the infringement question \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is the more substantial,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd according to justice Elena Kagan. Her ruling, supported by all justices, says that the court of appeals used the wrong inquiry when the accused infringer used a trademark as a trademark, and send it back to the lower court for another look. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That kind of use,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kagan writes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153falls within the heartland of trademark law, and does not receive special protection.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the formal ruling on that. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just after 10am ET, and the first of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decisions from the supreme court has been handed down. First up is from the newest justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson and a relatively minor case about nursing home reform. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case of Health &amp; Hospital Corp of Marion County v Talevski. The decision is 7-2, with justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissenting. The question before the court is whether nursing home residents can go to court to vindicate rights under the Federal Nursing Home Reform Act, the Scotusblog reports. The answer is yes. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ruling. There are 27 cases still to be decided by the supreme court, long-time panel watcher and former editor of Scotusblog Amy Howe says on her website. She offers brief summaries of all of them, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153including high-profile cases involving the use of race in college admissions, voting rights, election law, and the tension between legal protections for LGBTQ people and the rights of business owners who oppose same-sex marriage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. You can read Howe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summaries here. Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster who led the Christian Coalition and ran for president as a Republican, has died at 93. The Christian Broadcasting Network announced his death in a short Twitter post this morning. No cause was given. Robertson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enterprises also included Regent University, an evangelical Christian school in Virginia Beach; the American Center for Law and Justice, which defends the first amendment rights of religious people; and Operation Blessing, an international humanitarian organization. But for more than half a century, Robertson was a familiar presence in American living rooms, known for his 700 Club television show, and in later years, his televised pronouncements of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s judgment on America for everything from homosexuality to the teaching of evolution. Read the full story: After a relatively subdued opening to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decision season\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one week ago, rulings from supreme court justices are expected to start dropping again this morning within the hour. We could see consequential decisions regarding affirmative action, LGBTQ+ equality and the future of Native American tribes. As my colleague Ed Pilkington wrote in a preview, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the final nail-biting month of the panel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2022-3 term and its decisions could transform critical areas of public life. It comes amid ethics scandals and plummeting public confidence in the court, including calls for one of conservative members, Clarence Thomas, to resign. Yet as Ed writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The six rightwing justices who command a supermajority on the nine-seat bench are still expected to push at the limits of constitutional law in the pursuit of their ideological goals.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of the decisions relates to the pair of challenges to the race-conscious admissions policies of Harvard and the University of North Carolina. Should the supermajority strike down affirmative action it would overturn 50 years of established practice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a chilling echo of its evisceration of half a century of settled law on abortion. Please stick with us for supreme court developments as they happen. Meanwhile, while we wait, you can read Ed Pilkington\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preview here: Good morning US politics blog readers! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opinion day (again) at the supreme court, and justices could start handing down rulings at 10am on matters of deep consequence to the nation. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re waiting for decisions in cases regarding affirmative action, LGBTQ+ equality and the future of Native American tribes, but as with the panel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first opinions day of the session one week ago, we never know exactly which ones we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to get, or when. Last week, the justices gave us only three comparatively minor rulings, including one affecting striking labor unions. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll bring you whatever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in store today as it happens. Elsewhere in US politics, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaping up to be a lively day: The House of Representatives has been paralyzed by Republican hardliners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 revolt against speaker Kevin McCarthy over the deal made with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling. An indictment could be coming soon for Donald Trump after the justice department informed his lawyers that the former president was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153target\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of their investigation into the improper handling of classified documents. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to former vice-president Mike Pence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign launch for the Republican presidential nomination, and his subsequent appearance in a CNN town hall pretty much dominated by talk of Trump and his legal woes. Joe Biden welcomes UK prime minister Rishi Sunak to the White House for bilateral talks. The two leaders will give a lunchtime press conference. And influential religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, who turned the Christian Broadcasting Network into a political powerhouse, and who once ran for president as a Republican, has died aged 93."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/boy-15-on-e-bike-dies-in-collision-after-being-followed-by-police-in-salford", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Boy, 15, on e-bike dies in collision after being followed by police in Salford", "lead": "Greater Manchester police say officers were not following teenager when he collided with ambulance", "author": "Nadeem Badshah", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T20:09:40Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897010", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cc4b3558ff1d3c07f6bd5ea0b152ebf92553bd32/0_167_2000_1200/500.jpg", "body": "A 15-year-old boy riding an e-bike has died in a collision with an ambulance in Greater Manchester shortly after he was followed by traffic officers, police said.

Haaland and his compatriot Lars Bohinen were heavily involved in Forest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to the top flight that spring and, back then, neither player could have predicted where Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s influence on English football would lead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were kind of pioneers at the time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Bohinen, who joined Forest from Young Boys that season, of the influx that crossed the North Sea. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make any waves, we were just constantly being professional and producing performances. I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why we had so many players doing well in England.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Erling Haaland became the 74th Norwegian to play in the Premier League upon debuting for Manchester City last August, following in his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s footsteps 28 and a half years on; should he fire them to Champions League success and a treble on Saturday he will match the achievements of Ronny Johnsen and, famously, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00c3\u00a6r in 1999. The English league\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s primacy will be underlined if City win and there is a clear lineage back to the days when Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exports helped it on its way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were a decent generation of players but we were also able to adapt quickly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Bohinen of the 1990s brood. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When one succeeded then so did the next, and the third. It became a sort of snowball effect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Before the Bosman ruling opened up Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transfer market, Norwegians were the Premier League\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s must-have foreign accessory. Between 1992 and the end of 1995 their representatives totalled 13; Swedes and Danes, by contrast, accounted for eight apiece. Cultural similarities helped, as did English football\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increased awareness that it needed to look outwards; the high performance of Egil Olsen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s international side held attraction, too. The Forest pair achieved quick success after promotion with a third-placed finish in 1994-95 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a special team to be part of,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bohinen says \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and forged a bond that remains strong. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know each other well before he came but we were quite similar,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bohinen says of Haaland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We brought the hardworking outlook that I think was the main reason we succeeded, because there was a bit of a different mentality among the English players at the time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is not unreasonable to extrapolate that, much as Ars\u00c3\u00a8ne Wenger is feted for altering attitudes towards diet and conditioning, the Scandinavian school of the early 1990s encouraged a greater seriousness among their new peers. Bohinen and Haaland have passed that down to their offspring, too. Just as Erling was born in Leeds during Alf-Inge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time there, Bohinen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son Emil lists Derby on his birth certificate. Emil, now at Salernitana in Serie A, dovetailed with Erling at youth levels for Norway and played when the latter scored nine goals against Honduras in the 2019 Under-20 World Cup. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just like most of the guys in my generation he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been self-driven and only needed guidance here and there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bohinen says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the benefit we have as fathers in the game is that we know the pitfalls and challenges that can occur. We have experience to guide and give them solutions, and can help them maybe more than a regular father can, but they have to have that inner drive.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Norway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modern vintage have returned to its football a credibility that wavered after those early Premier League days. Solskj\u00c3\u00a6r\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heroics in Barcelona were never topped even if new arrivals in England remained semi-frequent. Bohinen is reluctant to state that he and his colleagues directly paved the way for the excellence Erling and Martin \u00c3\u02dcdegaard are now producing on these shores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are world-class and would have got there anyway,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I think they might be trailblazers for other Norwegians in their generation, and below, to play in the top five leagues.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Erling he sees the unmistakable influence of two sporting parents: the striker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, Gry Marita Braut, was a well known heptathlete. Does Erling retain any elements handed down by Norwegian strikers of bygone years? Bohinen detects a few, rolled up into a modern bundle that defies definition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He has his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s speed and running style,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And a mixture of physicality from his father and mother. As a player he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the whole package, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something out on his own. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the finishing technique of Solskj\u00c3\u00a6r, some of the skills of Tore Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Flo and Jan \u00c3\u2026ge Fj\u00c3\u00b8rtoft, some of Jostein Flo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physical presence. He reads the game incredibly well too and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a mixture of everything that makes him so difficult to stop. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique and you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see many of those players.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bohinen, who is manager of the Norwegian top-flight side Stab\u00c3\u00a6k, will text Haaland Sr if all goes smoothly in Istanbul. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I congratulate him when Erling does well so that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more or less all the time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They meet up in Oslo when diaries permit and were reunited at Bohinen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 50th birthday party. The legacy to which they and their contemporaries have contributed speaks for itself; the wish now is that Erling\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exploits help deepen it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we should be really proud of it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In some way we helped open up the English game to foreign players at the time. After that everything else opened up, and maybe that will happen again now for Norwegian players. I hope it raises awareness of their quality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/08/vote-plan-bar-mps-accused-sexual-violent-offences-under-police-investigation-from-westminster-estate-delayed", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Vote on plans to bar MPs accused of sexual or violent offences delayed", "lead": "Staff will be left at risk if proposals to ban members under police investigation from Westminster estate dropped, unions say", "author": "Aletha Adu Political correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T19:47:49Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897022", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5e917571c182b49d582af28871cc0905fcc9dffd/0_179_5358_3215/500.jpg", "body": "Long-awaited plans to bar MPs and peers accused of sexual or violent offences from Westminster will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kicked into the long grass\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it is feared, as plans to hold a debate on the proposals have been delayed. Commons leader Penny Mordaunt confirmed that MPs will debate whether MPs should be barred from entering the parliamentary estate once they are subject to police investigation on Monday, but there will be no vote. The debate follows a report from the House of Commons Commission that outlined the new proposals. Under the plans, MPs and peers under police investigation would be subject to a risk assessment carried out by a panel of officials. A separate panel of politicians, understood to be the deputy speakers of each chamber, would decide whether the member should be barred. Unions fear that if an exclusion is proposed, MPs may still be able to use their constituency offices. The FDA and Prospect civil service unions have warned that with seven weeks until parliament breaks for summer recess, calls for such measures to be enacted may lose momentum and continue to leave victims at risk in the run-up to the next general election. Mike Clancy, the Prospect general secretary, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For too long, staff and visitors to the parliamentary estate have been at risk from MPs credibly accused of violent and sexual misconduct being free to roam the Palace of Westminster. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unions, staff and others have worked with the speaker and the leader of house to develop a workable proposal that addresses this scandal and protects staff. This delay in allowing a vote on the proposals is unacceptable and must not be a precursor to kicking the recommendations into the long grass. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A vote must be held as soon as possible, and party leaders must instruct their MPs to support these proposals as the start of a much-needed culture change in Westminster.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The FDA national officer Jawad Raza said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a delay to voting on these welcome measures because for too long this issue of high importance has been kicked to the kerb. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no current mechanisms in place apart from a gentleman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agreement that says a person under investigation should not attend parliament. Parliament as a workplace should not be an exception. All individuals should be protected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The number of MPs who have lost their party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whip due to allegations of sexual harassment or assault has grown recently. The Labour party suspended Geraint Davies last week over allegations stretching back several years. Other examples include Chris Pincher, the former Conservative MP who lost the party whip over allegations that he had drunkenly groped two men. After the incident, Pincher said he had embarrassed himself and others and was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153truly sorry for the upset I caused\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The former Tory MP Rob Roberts lost the whip after being accused of making unwanted sexual advances. While Roberts accepted that his actions were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153completely improper and should not have happened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he rejected the characterisation of his advances as being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sexual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said instead that they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153romantic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. An unnamed Conservative MP is also on bail after being accused of rape, sexual assault and other related charges. All the MPs remain free to use the parliamentary estate. MPs and staffers have expressed concern that those already vulnerable after reporting serious incidents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and others shaken by reports of parliamentary sleaze scandals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are at risk from members under investigation but who are still free to roam the estate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ICGS [independent complaints and grievance scheme] investigations can take a very long time for a number of reasons. Vulnerable people should be protected from alleged perpetrators during this period until they are proved innocent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a senior MP has said. One union insider said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Will they reopen the consultation after the debate?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Across the eastern US residents were again urged to stay inside and limit or avoid outdoor activities on Thursday, as schools in some cities closed, sporting events were canceled and air travel was disrupted. New York City had the worst air quality of any big city in the world on Thursday morning, according to IQAir, while the second worst was Detroit. Air quality levels were in the 150-200 range on Thursday, marking a slight improvement from Wednesday when record-setting hazardous levels were observed, per Fox Weather. Smoke from wildfires in Canada has been moving south into the US since May. Hundreds of fires are burning in Canada, from the western provinces to Nova Scotia and Quebec in the east, where there are more than 150 active fires in a particularly fierce start to the summer season. The weather system driving the smoke south \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will probably be hanging around at least for the next few days,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bryan Ramsey, a US National Weather Service meteorologist, told the Associated Press. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Conditions are likely to remain unhealthy, at least until the wind direction changes or the fires get put out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ramsey said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the fires are raging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re really large \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re probably going to continue for weeks.

Students in New York City public schools were on a pre-scheduled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153non-attendance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd day. New Jersey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health commissioner, Judith Persichilli, emphasised that the air quality was particularly a risk for young children and suggested those with asthma medicine or rescue inhalers should keep them nearby. She also recommended that children avoid athletic activity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Children are particularly at risk,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Persichilli said on Thursday during a news briefing in Newark. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is because they breathe more air relative to their size.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, said the state was making a million N95 masks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the type prevalent at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c available at state facilities, including 400,000 in New York City. She urged residents to stay indoors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to go out and take a walk. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to push the baby in the stroller,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hochul said on Wednesday night. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is not a safe time to do that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On Thursday, Eric Adams, the New York mayor, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153right now, the smoke models are not indicating another large plume over the city\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that there was a chance of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant improvement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd throughout Friday. In Washington, Muriel Bowser, the mayor, ordered schools to cancel outdoor recess, sports and field trips on Thursday. In suburban Philadelphia, officials set up an emergency shelter so people living outside can take refuge from the haze. More than 400 fires burning across Canada have left 20,000 people displaced. The US has sent more than 600 firefighters and support personnel to assist Canadian firefighters, the White House said on Wednesday. Joe Biden spoke to Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, by phone on Wednesday. Trudeau\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said he thanked Biden for his support and that both leaders \u00e2\u20ac\u0153acknowledged the need to work together to address the devastating impacts of climate change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Federal Aviation Authority said poor visibility caused by the smoke would continue to affect air travel. On Thursday morning, the FAA paused some flights heading to LaGuardia airport in New York. In New York City, performances of Hamilton and Camelot were cancelled on Wednesday night due to the difficulties caused by the air pollution, while baseball games in New York and Philadelphia were postponed. Smoke reached as far south as Alabama on Wednesday, although the National Weather Service said the effects were not as severe. Canadian officials say this is shaping up to be the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worst wildfire season ever. It started early on drier-than-usual ground and accelerated quickly. Smoke from the blazes has been lapping into the US since last month but intensified with recent fires in Quebec, where about 100 were considered out of control on Wednesday. The smoke was so thick in Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital, Ottawa, that office towers just across the Ottawa River were barely visible. Eastern Quebec got some rain on Wednesday, but the Montreal-based Environment Canada meteorologist Simon Legault said no significant rain is expected for days in the remote areas of central Quebec where the wildfires are more intense. A 2021 study supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association found that climate change has been the main driver of the increase in hot, dry fire weather in the western US. By 2090, global wildfires are expected to increase in intensity by up to 57% thanks to climate change, a United Nations report warned last year.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is understood to be widening an existing investigation into allegations of misconduct at his firm, Odey Asset Management (OAM), after the Financial Times reported allegations on Thursday that Odey had abused or harassed 13 women over decades. The FT first reported that the FCA was expanding its investigation to consider potential non-financial misconduct by Odey. Odey confirmed he had been previously \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cross-examined\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the FCA over allegations in an investigation he claimed had been closed. The watchdog said it was unable to comment, but sources close to the regulator said the scope of an investigation changes depending on the evidence. Two of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest investment banks, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan, are in the process of cutting their ties with OAM in response to the claims. The FT reported allegations from eight women who accused Odey of sexually assaulting them. The alleged incidents, which included a claim that he masturbated on a female entrepreneur, were said to have occurred between 1998 and 2021. Approached by the Guardian for comment, Odey said the allegations had not been proven in court and he had done nothing illegal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have been cross-examined by the FCA,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The one thing I have not been is hiding anything. I have kept everybody apprised of any accusations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Odey, 64, claimed the FT report was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rehash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of previous reporting, and said the allegations within it were either untrue, or that his relations with women had at the time been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153consensual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A law firm representing the hedge fund manager has previously told the FT that Odey \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strenuously disputed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the accusations and said the newspaper had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153preordained agenda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In 2020, Odey was accused of assaulting a female investment banker at his London home in 1998, but was later cleared. The FT investigation also alleged that senior executives at OAM knew about some of the allegations for up to 16 years before the firm launched a formal investigation into Odey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conduct. OAM declined to comment. A lawyer for OAM, which Odey founded and majority owns, has said the firm has compulsory training on diversity, equity and inclusion for all staff. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It takes staff relations very seriously,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the lawyer said. Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan declined to comment, but sources close to the banks said their decisions to cut their ties with OAM were a direct response to the allegations. Odey made political donations of more than \u00c2\u00a31.7m between 2007 and 2019, according to Electoral Commission filings. He and his hedge fund donated \u00c2\u00a31.3m to groups campaigning for Brexit at about the time of the EU referendum. He has given about \u00c2\u00a3350,000 to the Conservatives, and \u00c2\u00a310,000 directly to former prime minister Boris Johnson."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/washington-girl-found-survives-cascade-mountains", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "10-year-old girl survives 24 hours in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrugged and remote\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Cascade mountains", "lead": "Shunghla Mashwani was on a family outing when she went missing, but rescuers found her the next day in the wilderness", "author": "Erum Salam", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T19:34:49Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897030", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8c6ceab1a898fbfb68e81a7e57864f266bb327e6/0_629_2044_1226/500.jpg", "body": "A 10-year-old girl is being praised for surviving on her own for more than 24 hours in the Cascade mountain range in Washington state.

The family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s search for the child was made difficult since communication in the area is extremely limited, with no cell or radio signal.

The deal mitigates some of the issues cause by Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with proposals for a critical minerals agreement to remove barriers which affected trade in electric vehicle batteries.

London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Docks said it had informed the Home Office last month that water beside City Airport would not be appropriate as a potential location to moor one of its floating accommodation vessels for refugees. The use of barges is part of government efforts to deter asylum seekers from embarking on dangerous Channel crossings in small boats and to reduce the amount spent on hotels for those arriving in Britain via unlawful routes. Teachers in England are abandoning their profession in record numbers, according to official figures, with Labour claiming that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incompetent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government policies were to blame. Keir Starmer claimed Labour has a plan to revitalise the British steel industry. Speaking at a British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a huge demand for steel in the future, and I want that to be British steel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just at the moment, British steel is struggling, and we need to move to a new model, to green steel, and here it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been made absolutely clear to me that customers of the future want that green steel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing nothing on this...\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd From The Sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Harry Cole. Sky News\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Beth Rigby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reaction to the press conference. And that brings the press conference to an end. Sunak is asked by the Times whether the Atlantic agreement shows the era of unfettered globalisation is over. The PM replies the US does not believe in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153zero sum competition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as they discussed at the G7, citing the critical mineral agreement. He says the Atlantic agreement is about strengthening cooperation. Biden is asked whether its time for the first British Nato secretary general, ie Ben Wallace. The US president says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maybe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and they need to get a consensus within Nato. Biden says they held good discussions today about critical materials such as battery technology and addressing the climate crisis. Also cooperating on data and AI. Sunak is asked by the BBC whether today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Atlantic deal shows the failure to deliver a free trade deal with America. He replies its a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153first of a kind agreement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ambitious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd around strengthening economic security and researching technologies of the future to increase jobs. Sunak believes the economic relationship between the two nations \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has never been stronger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sunak is asked what is the US and UK doing to protect AI misinformation campaigns around elections and democracy and the overall regulation of the sector. He says its clear AI will bring incredible benefits to society but also real risks. He wants to discuss the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153guard rails\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with other countries but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give any specifics. On anti-LGBTQ and anti-transgender laws being passed in some US states, Biden says he was proud to scrap the ban on trasngender troops, support equal marriage legislation and enhance LGBT human rights around the globe. He says it is wrong for people to be fired by their employer because of their sexuality and violence and hate crime is increasing. He announces some new initiatives on protecting the community around physical safety and mental health resources. Biden adds that after talks with Japan recently they have increased their budget, involvement and support for Ukraine. Sunak is asked whether there is a common position on a security agreement with Ukraine. He responds that defence spending in the UK has been above the 2% NATO benchmark on an increasing trajectory and he would encourage other countries to follow suit. He adds that Vladmir Putin will be thinking the alliance will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tire out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and will try to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wait us out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which he says the alliance will not be doing. In response to a question about funding Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counter-offensive, Biden says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we have done everything to make them ready\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that long-term security after the war is a goal. He believes the US will have the funding necessary \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for as long as it takes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Sunak speaks about the pioneers of AI warning last week about the challenges and opportunities. The PM also asks people to judge post-Brexit Britain on its actions. Sunak says the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contribution to the war in Ukraine is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153decisive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and thanks Biden. Sunak also warns that economic security must be protected from countries such as Russia and China and that is why he believes the Atlantic declaration is necessary. Sunak said he believes the UK and US can lead the world together including on national security, citing the Aukus agreement. Sunak begins by paying his condolences to those affected by the knife attack in southern France earlier today. Biden adds the pair discussed Northern Ireland, which was positive and helped deepen relations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Critical mineral supply chains\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were also discussed; The US president said there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no country closer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to the US than the UK and reaffirmed the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On Ukraine, Biden thanks Sunak for showing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong leadership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd regarding the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military assistance to the country. Biden says when it comes to semiconductors, AI, and quantum computing the UK and US are working together to ensure they are built responsibly and safely through joint research and development. Sunak and president Biden have agreed a new partnership to bolster economic security in response to China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing influence. The Atlantic declaration includes commitments on easing trade barriers, closer defence industry ties and a data protection deal. The agreement comes after hopes of a full-blown free trade deal were abandoned, with UK officials insisting the new, targeted approach was a better response to the economic challenges posed by Beijing and Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine. Joe Biden jokes that Sunak is probably tired of seeing him having met in March, April and May. He adds they have held discussions today to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deepen the bilateral relationship\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expand cooperation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We are about to get under way. Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden have entered the room fashionably late. We are still awaiting the start of the press conference in the East Room of the White House. During their meeting at the White House, Joe Biden accidentally referred to Rishi Sunak by his own title. Biden called the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mr President\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He quickly corrected himself and joked he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153promoted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sunak. Biden said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, Mr president - Mr president, I just promoted you. Mr prime minister, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to have you back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sunak appeared to laugh off the error. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first time the president has made an error with Rishi Sunak. When Sunak became head of the Conservative party and prime minister, Biden mistakenly referred to him as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rashi Sanook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd during a Diwali event at White House. Here is a clip: The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Walker is among the reporters at the White House eagerly awaiting the press conference. Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak, fresh from their meeting at the White House earlier, are due to hold a joint press conference shortly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scheduled to start at 6.30pm BST but may, in reality, be closer to 6.45pm. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have a live stream at the top of the blog (you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to refresh the page at 6.30pm) and we will provide live text updates as well. Peers have inflicted three defeats on the government over the controversial strikes (minimum service levels) bill. In the first round of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ping pong\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the process where MPs and peers keep voting on bills that have gone through all their parliamentary stages, until one side backs down, to resolve outstanding differences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c peers voted by a majority of 30 for an amendment that would render much of the legislation toothless. The bill says that, if unions want to stage strikes in six sectors (health, education, fire and rescue, transport, border security, and nuclear decommissioning), the government would be to require minimum services to operate on strike days. It originally cleared the Commons in January and last month, after it went through the Lords, MPs voted to take out anti-government amendments passed by peers. Today, by 180 votes to 150, peers voted for a Labour amendment that saying workers could not be sacked if they were ordered to work on strike days, under the MSL provisions, and refused. The amendment was proposed by Frances O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Grady, the former TUC general secretary, who told peers: This amendment seeks to uphold a principle long-established in British law that workers on strike are protected against the sack. Lord Callanan, the energy minister responding for the government, said that the bill was not meant to be about sacking workers, but that employers should be able to take disciplinary action if workers put the public at risk by going on strike. The government was defeated on two other amendments. Peers voted by a majority of 32 for an amendment saying ministers would have to meet a series of conditions, including conducting an impact assessment and holding further consultations, before imposing minimum service regulations. And by a majority of 31 they voted in favour of an amendment saying unions should be entitled to tell members to ignore orders telling them to work on strike days under the MSL legislation. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all from me for today. A colleague is now taking over. Joe Biden has insisted that the special relationship with the UK is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in good shape\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in his first public remarks alongside Rishi Sunak. My colleague Peter Walker posted the following on their brief exchange in the Oval Office. Biden and Sunak are holding a press conference later. This seems to have been what in the US they call a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pool spray\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (basically a photocall, but with reporters getting the chance to try the odd question). Rishi Sunak has arrived at the White House for his meeting with President Biden. Permission to berth a barge housing asylum seekers at an east London docks has been rejected, PA Media reports. PA says: London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Docks said it had informed the Home Office last month that water beside City Airport would not be appropriate as a potential location to moor one of its floating accommodation vessels for refugees. The use of barges is part of government efforts to deter asylum seekers from embarking on dangerous Channel crossings in small boats and to reduce the amount spent on hotels for those arriving in Britain via unlawful routes. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, had set out his objections publicly to the suggestion that a location in the capital could be chosen for such a vessel. He has since written to Suella Braverman, the home secretary, to express his support for the Royal Docks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decision to deny permission for a barge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am writing to you following the recent decision by the Royal Docks Management Authority to reject the use of King George V Dock as a berth to accommodate people seeking asylum,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told her in a letter seen by PA. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wish first to put on record my support for this decision and secondly to outline my absolute opposition to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy of housing asylum seekers on vessels.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked about Royal Docks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 stance, a Home Office spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The pressure on the asylum system has continued to grow and requires us to look at a range of accommodation options which offer better value for the British taxpayer than expensive hotels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is why we continue to source new alternative sites and vessels to accommodate migrants, which are more manageable for communities, as our European neighbours are doing. We understand the concerns of local communities and will work closely with councils and key partners to manage the impact of using these sites, including liaising with local police to make sure appropriate arrangements are in place.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Teachers in England are abandoning their profession in record numbers, according to official figures, with Labour claiming that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incompetent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd government policies were to blame, Richard Adams reports. The Conservatives have broken a manifesto promise by failing to strike a free trade deal with the US, Keir Starmer has said. The government has been playing down the prospect of a free trade deal with the US ever since Joe Biden became president, and in remarks to journalists on his flight to Washington Rishi Sunak implied this was no longer even an ambition. Today Starmer pointed out that this meant Sunak has accepted that a Tory manifesto promise has been broken. The 2019 manifesto said: We aim to have 80% of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next three years, starting with the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. When it was put to Sunak that this amounted to a broken promise, he claimed that the economic situation had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evolved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd since 2019. He told Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beth Rigby: I think you have to look at the macroeconomic situation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evolved since [2019] and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important the economic partnerships evolved to deal with the opportunities and threats of today. When Rigby asked him if he accepted that this was a broken promise, Sunak replied: Since then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a pandemic. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had a war in Ukraine and that has changed the macroeconomic situation. The right response to that is to ensure that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re focusing our engagement economically on the things that will make the most difference to the British people. Rigby pointed out that the pandemic and the war had not stopped the UK signing other trade deals. Keir Starmer claimed today that Labour has a plan to revitalise the British steel industry. Speaking at a British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, he said: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be a huge demand for steel in the future, and I want that to be British steel. Just at the moment, British steel is struggling, and we need to move to a new model, to green steel, and here it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been made absolutely clear to me that customers of the future want that green steel. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing nothing on this, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sitting on its hands, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve put forward a plan that will help that transition with the investment that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed, the partnership that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s needed, and the opportunity then is not just to save steel but to provide it with a fantastic future, which is clean steel, which is secure steel used for contracts here in the UK, and to secure the jobs of thousands of people in this sector. There are some details of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan in its industrial strategy. It says: As part of our step-change in green investment, Labour government would match-fund investment in a decade-long plan to drive innovation in the sector, including in hydrogen and electric arc furnace technology. This will be combined with our energy security plan to lower energy costs and drive long-term competitiveness. Nearly one in four pupils at state schools in England are now eligible for free school meals, while a record one in five have a first language other than English, PA Media reports. PA says: Eligibility for free school meals stood at 23.8% of all pupils in January this year, the equivalent of 2 million children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c up from 22.5%, or 1.9 million, in January 2022. The figure has increased every year since January 2018, when it stood at 13.6% or 1.1 million, according to data published by the Department for Education (DfE). Children in state-funded schools in England can receive free meals if a parent or carer is receiving one of a number of benefits, including universal credit, child tax credits or income support. Free meals can also be available to households unable to claim benefits but which meet certain criteria, such as children of work visa holders or families holding a British National Overseas passport who have moved to the UK from Hong Kong. In his Times story saying Rishi Sunak has accepted Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honours list, Steve Swinford says that Tories hope this decision will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153help bring to an end months of acrimony between the two men\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is fresh evidence out today indicating quite how acrimonious the relationship between Johnson and Sunak has been. Guto Harri, who was the director of communications for Johnson in the final months of his premiership, has been recalling his time at No 10 in his podcast, Unprecedented, and in the latest episode he says that when Johnson appointed Jacob Rees-Mogg as the Brexit opportunites minister in February 2022, he encouraged him to create problems for Sunak, the then chancellor. They also joked about Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size, Harri recalls. Harri, who was in the cabinet room with Johnson when Rees-Mogg accepted the job, says: [Rees-Mogg] warned the prime minister that on Brexit he thought the government had got to the point where it was trying to keep the UK deliberately in what he called the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclunar orbit of the EU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. He warned that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgone native\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Boris asked him to give it all a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmassive kick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Jacob Rees-Mogg warned then that he would have to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctread on some big toes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 actually, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclittle toes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he added, patronisingly, with a sort of dig at Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size. And Boris, after a little chuckle, gave him carte blanche to be a pain in the backside for the Treasury and for Rishi Sunak. His words quite simply, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgo ahead\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. There is more evidence of the extent to which the Johnson/Sunak relationship had broken down by 2022 in Johnson at 10 by Anthony Seldon and Raymond Newell, easily the best account of the Johnson premiership in print and bursting with high-grade insider info. They quote Johnson as saying this about his chancellor as his time in office was coming to an end: I want him to make thing happen, reduce tax, produce a growth plan. But all I get is blancmange. In an interview in the US with Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beth Rigby, Rishi Sunak refused to comments on the report that he has now accepted Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honours list. (See 1.13pm.) It is not just hospital waiting lists that are getting longer. (See 9.58am.) HM Courts and Tribunals Service has published figures today showing that the backlog of cases in courts is growing too. The backlog in crown courts in England and Wales rose from 61,180 in March 2023 to 61,712 in April 2023. In April 2022 it was 57,768. And in magistrates courts the backlog went up from 337,367 in April 2022 to 347,769 in April 2023. Lubna Shuja, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales, which highlighted the figures, said: It is extremely concerning to see the case backlogs in the magistrates courts and crown courts continue to grow. It is unacceptable that victims and defendants are still having to wait years for trials to take place. Decades of underinvestment and cuts mean there simply aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough judges and lawyers to tackle this huge volume of cases. The Ministry of Justice is likely to miss its unambitious March 2025 target to get the court backlog down to 53,000. Urgent funding must be injected into our criminal justice system immediately to restore it to its former health. This is necessary to ensure victims and defendants can access timely justice. Lord Butler, a former cabinet secretary, has urged the government to pause its legal challenge against the Covid inquiry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s demand to see unredacted WhatsApp messages from Boris Johnson and other senior figures. Speaking during questions in the House of Lords, Butler said: There is a strong public interest in this inquiry being carried out constructively and expeditiously and that should be a public interest between the government and the investigation as well. So would the minister agree that it would be helpful if judicial review proceedings were stayed so that the government and the inquiry can reach a reasonable accommodation on this issue? Lady Neville-Rolfe, the Cabinet Office minister who was responding, said that while the government wanted to reach a compromise with the inquiry, the judicial review was going ahead. She told Butler: Where I agree with the noble lord is that if an accommodation could be reached, we have been having discussions with the inquiry to bridge the gap between sincerely held views. However, we have also requested for any judicial review to be held expeditiously and we are very glad that the court has agreed to deal with this before the end of June. The Royal College of Nursing says the figures showing the hospital waiting list going up in England (see 9.58am) confirm the need for nurses to be paid more, because they show the impact of staff shortages. Commenting on the figures, Patricia Marquis, the RCN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director for England, said: Despite the prime minister saying cutting waiting lists is one of his top priorities, waiting times continue to head in the wrong direction and reflect a health and care system in crisis. Nursing staff are working around the clock to get to those waiting for the care they need. But with tens of thousands of vacancies, waiting times will not get shorter until the government addresses this and invests in the staff who have been neglected for too long. This has to start with paying nursing staff fairly. President Biden has agreed to support a planned summit in the UK this autumn on ways to regulate artificial intelligence, Rishi Sunak has said on the second and final day of his trip to Washington DC. Speaking to Sky News outside Blair House, the presidential guest residence, before a meeting with US business leaders, after which he will head to the White House for talks with Biden, the prime minister confirmed what officials had been strongly hinting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that Biden is on board with the idea. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be discussing that with President Biden today. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m delighted the US is supporting our summit,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, while being noncommittal about the wider idea of a UK-based global regulator for AI. He went on: I think that we need to start the conversation about what the type of regulation we need is, the form that will take is the type of topic one would hope we can discuss. Elsewhere, the interview was mainly notable for the way it almost exactly mimicked the other four or five TV chats Sunak has done so far on the trip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c either dodging questions or giving carefully-worded answers, very often using the same precise phrases in each. Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly polished, managerial style sometimes masks the fact that when he speaks to the media, he has a very Theresa May-style tendency to roboticism. This trait has arguably been emphasised all the more on a ceremony-heavy but news-light trip in which there has been little novel to explain. The Liberal Democrats say Rishi Sunak should put Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honours list (see 1.13pm) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153through the shedder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a statement Daisy Cooper, the deputy Lib Dem leader, said: The fact that one of the most scandal-ridden prime ministers is now allowed to stuff his cronies in the Lords after a failed premiership tells the British public everything they need to know about this Conservative party. Boris Johnson caused crisis after crisis in this country - if Rishi Sunak rewards his failure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just proof it is one rule for the Conservatives and another for everyone else. The buck stops with Sunak - he must ensure that Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honours list is put through the shredder. Keir Starmer has claimed that Rishi Sunak is not able to govern the country properly because he is preoccupied with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153managing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd his party. The Labour leader was referring to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Times splash saying Sunak has now agreed to accept Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation honours list, which is now expected to be published within weeks. Speaking on a visit to a British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, Starmer said Labour was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153talking about the future of our country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He went on: The Conservative party is, as ever, talking about the Conservative party and how they appease different bits of their own party. Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WhatsApp messages, Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peerages, all the prime minister is doing is managing his own party instead of running the country. Starmer said that anyone concerned about the cost of living is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going to see a government that is putting a party first, not country first\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. (To be fair to Sunak, although party management is a preoccupation for him, and constrains his political choices, it is not something he actually talks about much in public. He has said almost nothing on the record about Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honours list.) Labour says Rishi Sunak is failing in his mission to cut waiting lists. Responding to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NHS performance figures (see 9.58am and 12.36pm), Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: Rishi Sunak promised to cut waiting lists, but hundreds of thousands more patients are waiting for treatment today than when he became prime minister. The longer the Conservatives are in office, the longer patients wait. Labour has a plan to train the staff the NHS needs. We will double medical school places and train 10,000 more nurses and midwives a year, paid for by abolishing the non-dom tax status. Where\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan? Next week the Covid inquiry will start taking evidence from witnesses in person for the first time. They will be addressing the issues in module 1, which is looking at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resilience and preparedness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what happened before the pandemic started to prepare the UK for such a crisis. The inquiry has now published its list of witnesses for next week and they include Katharine Hammond, the former director of the civil contingencies secretariat in the Cabinet Office, and Prof Sir Michael Marmot, a leading public health expert and a prominent critic of the coalition government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s austerity programme. Cancer waiting times across the NHS in England have got worse, PA Media reports. In an updated report on the NHS England performance figures published today (see 9.58am), PA says: Figures from NHS England show 61.0% of cancer patients who had their first treatment in April after an urgent GP referral had waited less than two months for treatment to start. This is down from 63.5% in March. The target is 85%. Meanwhile, the proportion of cancer patients who saw a specialist within two weeks of being referred urgently by their GP fell from 83.9% in March to 77.7% in April, remaining below the 93% target and the lowest figure since September 2022. The 93% target was last hit in May 2020, during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Elsewhere, 71.3% of patients urgently referred for suspected cancer were diagnosed or had cancer ruled out within 28 days, down from 74.2% the previous month. The NHS elective recovery plan sets a goal of March 2024 for 75% of patients who have been urgently referred by their GP for suspected cancer to be diagnosed or have cancer ruled out within 28 days. Overall, some 218,060 urgent cancer referrals were made by GPs in England in April, down month-on-month (by 16% compared with March 2023) but up year-on-year (by 2% compared with April 2022). Seven per cent more people were referred for urgent cancer checks in the year to April, though the data shows they are having to wait longer to be seen or treated. Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures came out as the Royal College of Radiologists said cancer patients are facing life-threatening hospital delays and the prospect of more gruelling treatment as a result of NHS staff shortages. The Electoral Commission has confirmed that it did want the government to accept the amendment to the national security bill that would have required political parties to produce statements saying what they were doing to ensure they were not inadvertently taking donations originating with foreign powers. (See 10.47am.) Asked to explain what reforms to party funding laws it is still pushing for, a spokesperson said: We have recommended since 2018 that the UK government and parliament should consider the need for stronger controls on donations and loans to political parties and campaigners to help protect parties from those who seek to evade the law, and give voters confidence in our political finance system. This would include additional duties for regulated entities, including political parties and campaigners, to check the true source of donations and assess the risk of accepting donations including from overseas. It would help strengthen the regime, protect elections from unlawful influence and improve transparency for voters. There are more details of what the commission is proposing in its digital campaigning report. The North Sea oil and gas industry is in decline, the shadow business minister Seema Malhotra said, as she defended plans to block new drilling licences, a move criticised by trade unions. Aubrey Allegretti has the story here. MPs will hold a debate on Monday on proposals to ban members from the parliamentary estate if they are being investigated for a criminal offence and are deemed to pose a risk to other people. The plans have been drawn up following concerns that MPs accused of serious sexual offences, including rape, have been allowed to continue working in parliament. But, as Eleni Courea writes in her Politico London Playbook briefing, the proposals are controversial. She says: Last night the government was debating whether to hold a vote on Monday on proposals to ban MPs accused of violent or sexual offences from the estate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d after backlash from some Tory backbenchers. One senior Tory MP told Playbook they opposed the plan because it would overturn \u00e2\u20ac\u0153common practice that you are innocent until proven guilty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In her statement on next week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commons business, Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the Commons, said there would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a general debate on risk-based exclusion of members of parliament\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Monday next week, after debates on the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill and on some Public Order Act regulations. But Mordaunt did not say that MPs would be asked to vote on the proposed changes to the rules next week. Ministers may favour holding a general debate first, without a vote to implement new procedures, to establish how much support they have. Significant reform of England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beleaguered adult social care sector could be ushered in by the next Labour government under plans that include boosting pay for care workers, expanding the scope of free support, and a \u00c2\u00a350 weekly contribution towards costs for those who need it. Pippa Crerar has the story here. And here are two less charitable takes on Caroline Lucas, from two Labour figures who both worked as special advisers when the party was last in government. Politicians from rival parties and other campaigners have been paying tribute to Caroline Lucas on Twitter following the news that she is standing down from parliament at the next election. (See 8.59am.) Here is a selection. From Gary Lineker From the Labour MP Chris Bryant From Angus Robertson, the former SNP MP who is now constitution secretary in the Scottish government From Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster From the Labour MP Clive Lewis From the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran From the environmental campaigner and Guardian columnist George Monbiot From Andrew Fisher, the head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn when he was Labour leader From Chris Dillow, the leftwing economics blogger The Electoral Commission has renewed its call for the law around political donations to be tightened following the publication of figures showing more than \u00c2\u00a320m was donated to parties in the first quarter of this year. That compares with almost \u00c2\u00a313m donated in the first quarter of 2022. In a statement issued alongside the new figures, Louise Edwards, the commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director of regulation and digital transformation, said: We publish details of these donations so that voters understand how political parties are funded. We know transparency of party and campaigner finance is important for people, but our research tells us that only 24% of people believe party funding is transparent. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that publishing this information is not enough. We continue to recommend to the UK government that it reforms the system, to help protect parties from those who seek to evade the law, and give voters more confidence. The figures show that the Conservatives received \u00c2\u00a312.1m in the first three months of this year, Labour \u00c2\u00a34.4m (including \u00c2\u00a32m from Lord Sainsbury), the Liberal Democrats \u00c2\u00a31.3m and the SNP just \u00c2\u00a34,000. Earlier this year the government rejected opposition attempts to amend the national security bill to require political parties to produce statements saying what they are doing to ensure they are not taking money from foreign powers. Under current law, parties are not allowed to take money from foreign companies or governments. But there have been calls for the law to be tightened because companies based in the UK that donate to political parties do not have to show that that money was generated in the UK. Sir Julian Lewis, the Conservative chair of parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intelligence and security committee, was one of the MPs who backed the amendment to the national security bill. But the government rejected it, arguing it was unnecessary. UPDATE: See 12.22pm for more details of the party funding reforms the commission is proposing. NHS England has released new waiting time figures. PA Media has the main points. The number of people in England waiting to start routine hospital treatment has risen to a record high, PA reports. PA says: An estimated 7.4 million people were waiting to start treatment at the end of April, up from 7.3 million in March, NHS England said. It is the highest number since records began in August 2007. Rishi Sunak has made cutting waiting lists one of his priorities for 2023, pledging in January that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lists will fall and people will get the care they need more quickly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Some 11,477 people are estimated to have been waiting more than 18 months to start routine hospital treatment at the end of April, NHS England said. PA says: This is up from 10,737 at the end of March. The government and NHS England set the ambition of eliminating all waits of more than 18 months by April of this year, excluding exceptionally complex cases or patients who choose to wait longer. A total of 371,111 people in England had been waiting more than 52 weeks to start routine hospital treatment at the end of April. PA says: This is up from 359,798 at the end of March. The government and NHS England have set the ambition of eliminating all waits of more than a year by March 2025. Some 218,060 urgent cancer referrals were made by GPs in England in April, down month-on-month (by 16% compared with March 2023) but up year-on-year (by 2% compared with April 2022). PA says: The proportion of cancer patients who saw a specialist within two weeks of being referred urgently by their GP fell from 83.9% in March to 77.7% in April, remaining below the 93% target and the lowest figure since September 2022. The 93% target was last hit in May 2020, during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Labour MP Jess Phillips broke Commons rules by registering a payment from the University of Bristol two days late, a report from the Commons standards committee reveals today. Daniel Greenberg, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, launched an investigation after a member of the public complained that Phillips had not registered payment for an appearance on a TV show on 17 January 2020. Greenberg established that Phillips had not registered a payment because she had not been paid for the broadcast, but in the course of his inquiry he found that Phillips had registered a payment from the University of Bristol two days after the 28-day deadline. He said that, although this was a minor breach, he was reporting it to the Commons standards committee because it happened less than six months after Phillips corrected her failure to submit some other entries on time. Phillips told the commissioner that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153administrative changes in her office\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were to blame for the University of Bristol money being declared late. The standards committee said it was not recommending any further action. In comments that suggest the committee thinks that Greenberg might have been a tad over-zealous in this case, and that he did not need to produce a full report on Phillips (a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rectification\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd process is available which allows minor breaches to be resolved without a full report going to the standards committee), it said: We note the commissioner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s memorandum and are grateful to him for his diligence. This case underlines the need for members to submit their complete registrations in good time. And here are the best extracts from Caroline Lucas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interview on the Today programme: Lucas said that she would not be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153retiring with my knitting\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after leaving the Commons, and that not being an MP would give her more time to focus on climate issues. She said: The thing that really motivates me, what really drives me, is action around the climate and nature emergencies. Over the course of my lifetime alone, populations and some of our most important wildlife have plummeted by over half. The climate crisis is accelerating, warnings we will crash through that 1.5C climate threshold within the next five years. So these are really massive issues. And because I have to be the frontbench spokesperson on everything for my party, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pulling so many directions, from benefits to Brexit, and it just means that I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the time that I personally want to those big issues around climate and nature. She said climate activists were right to use direct action and she gave qualified support to the Just Stop Oil protests. Asked if she supported direct action by campaigners, she replied: I think there is a role for physical direct action and as you say - I always have done and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done it myself. And when Nick Robinson put it to her that groups like Just Stop Oil were doing more to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153energise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd young people over the climate crisis than Green party politicians, Lucas replied: I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a combination of both, to be honest. I think people who are taking peaceful, direct action, whether or not I agree with every single tactic, they have certainly accelerated the focus on this issue, mobilised huge numbers of people. But I think you also need people only on the inside of politics too. I just remember those words from Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, where he said the truly dangerous radicals are not people who are protesting in the streets, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governments who aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t facing up to the size of the emergency that we face and are still, for example in the case of our own government, licensing more oil and gas. That is what is truly dangerous and radical, not people who are quite understandably driven to take action on the streets because they are seeing that we are careering towards a cliff edge. She said Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government was more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerous and radical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd than the Just Stop Oil protesters because of its energy policies. (See quote in the paragraph above.) Yesterday, Sunak described Just Stop Oil activists as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eco-zealots\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153essentially leading us into an energy surrender\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She said she wanted to help the Green party get more people elected. Its performance in the local elections was its best ever, she said, and she said the Greens are now the largest party on 10 councils, and in administration in more than 30. Good morning. Tony Benn famously said, when he stood down as an MP, that he was leaving the House of Commons so that he would have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more time to devote to politics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This morning Caroline Lucas, Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first Green party MP, has in effect announced she is doing the same. More than 50 MPs have said they are standing down at the next election, but Lucas is one of the most significant figures on the list. Lucas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election, as MP for Brighton Pavilion, was a major boost to the Green party (which she has twice led) and to the environmental cause generally. In an open letter to her constituents, she highlights some of the progress made on green, and other, issues over the past 13 years. Explaining her decision to stand down, she says: The intensity of these constituency commitments, together with the particular responsibilities of being my party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sole MP, mean that, ironically, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not been able to focus as much as I would like on the existential challenges that drive me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the nature and climate emergencies. I have always been a different kind of politician \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as those who witnessed my arrest, court case and acquittal over peaceful protest at the fracking site in Balcombe nearly ten years ago will recall. And the truth is, as these threats to our precious planet become ever more urgent, I have struggled to spend the time I want on these accelerating crises. I have therefore decided not to stand again as your MP at the next election. The reason I came into politics was to change things. Thirteen years ago it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inconceivable that parliament would have declared a climate emergency. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve put issues like a universal basic income and a legal right to access nature on the political agenda; secured the first parliamentary debate in a generation on drug law reform; and thanks to my work in parliament, a natural history GCSE will soon be on the syllabus. I have said the previously unsayable, only to see it become part of the mainstream, on coal, on the myth that endless economic growth makes us happier, on a green new deal. My determination to trying to make change is stronger than ever. I look forward to having the time to explore ever more imaginative and creative ways of helping to make a liveable future a reality. Watch this space! Here is Matthew Weaver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about Lucas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s announcement. Lucas has just been on the Today programme, where Nick Robinson also suggested she was acting like Tony Benn and Lucas said she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very happy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the comparison. I will post some highlights from the interview shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Keir Starmer and Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary for climate change and net zero, visit British Steel in North Lincolnshire. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 12.40pm (UK time): Rishi Sunak is due to speak to broadcasters before he attends a business roundtable with US CEOs in Washington. At 4pm he meets Joe Biden in the White House, and at 6.45pm they are due to hold a press conference. Afternoon: Peers debate Commons amendments to the strikes (minimum service levels) bill.

You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see it just below the byline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the left of the screen, if you are reading on a PC or a laptop. This is for people who want to message me directly. I find it very useful when people message to point out errors (even typos \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no mistake is too small to correct). Often I find your questions very interesting too. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either in the comments below the line, privately (if you leave an email address and that seems more appropriate), or in the main blog, if I think it is a topic of wide interest."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/key-plank-of-new-uk-asylum-law-dropped-to-cut-backlog", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Key plank of new UK asylum law dropped to cut backlog", "lead": "Home Office will no longer distinguish between people arriving by irregular means and other asylum seekers", "author": "Rajeev Syal Home affairs editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T19:16:38Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897038", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2391f8f3e8772bbee742c016893f67fb3e81fafc/0_16_3080_1848/500.jpg", "body": "Rishi Sunak has quietly dropped a key plank of last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asylum law that introduced a two-tier refugee system and made lives tougher for tens of thousands of people who arrived in the UK via small boats. In a move to cut the asylum backlog, the Home Office said in a written statement on Thursday that it would no longer differentiate between people who arrived by irregular means, such as those who crossed the Channel, and other asylum seekers, as had been stipulated in last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Nationality and Borders Act. It means the government will be able to speed up the processing of claims for about 55,000 people who have arrived in the UK since last June, according to refugee experts. Of those, nearly 15,000 from countries with high grant rates such as Afghanistan and Sudan can be processed using questionnaires instead of via in-person interviews. It also means that people who arrived by small boat will be given improved rights such as the ability to reunite with family members. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the decision was an admittance that the government had failed to deliver. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the right decision to pause the differentiation policy that treats refugees based on how they got to the UK rather than on their need for protection,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government is now admitting that its flagship Nationality and Borders Act has failed to deliver. As was predicted by us and other refugee organisations, it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deterred desperate men, women and children from taking dangerous journeys but has simply led to unnecessary misery for many refugees.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour seized on the change as further evidence of government incompetence over immigration policy. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the decision had left the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy in tatters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They have slipped out the announcement in a written statement to avoid publicity or scrutiny,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a damning indictment of the Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 flagship immigration bill, and of their entire record on small boats, and shows ministers have no idea what they are doing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some senior Conservatives condemned the decision. One said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This gets rid of a strong deterrent and looks like a de facto amnesty introduced just so they can process cases instead of stopping the boats. We are softening the approach under Rishi, which is not going to go down well on red wall doorsteps.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Priti Patel as home secretary last year announced plans to overhaul the asylum system and differentiate between people entering by legal routes, such as resettlement, and those arriving by irregular routes or having passed through countries deemed safe. Under the new law, those who came via small boats and successfully applied for asylum were to be offered temporary status of up to 30 months, with abridged rights and benefits that were regularly reviewed. The threat of removal would hang over their stay. The policy was condemned by the UNHCR for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undermining the 1951 refugee convention and longstanding global cooperation on refugee issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The U-turn was announced in a statement from by the immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, released on parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. He wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will pause the differentiation policy in the next package of immigration rules changes in July 2023. This means we will stop taking grouping decisions under the differentiated asylum system after these rules changes and those individuals who are successful in their asylum application, including those who are granted humanitarian protection, will receive the same conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jenrick said the new approach of the illegal migration bill, which is making its way through parliament, tackled the same issue that the two-tier differentiation policy sought to address. He said people who had received a second-tier \u00e2\u20ac\u0153group 2\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd status, which was reserved for those who arrived by irregular means, would have their conditions aligned with those of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153group 1\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd refugees. He backdated the applications to when the law was introduced in June 2022, adding that the government would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153streamline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd claims from people arriving from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Sudan. According to the Refugee Council, the change will affect 54,653 asylum claimants who arrived after June 2022. Of those, about 15,000 came from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Sudan. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Under the differentiation policy, people who came to the UK illegally and claimed asylum could receive a different protection offer to those who came here legally, helping reduce the incentive to make these illegal journeys in the first place. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are now going even further through our illegal migration bill to make sure that people who come here illegally won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have their asylum claim considered in the UK and instead can be detained and swiftly removed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To stop the boats, we have to take away the incentive for people to jump the queue by coming here illegally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that is what we are focused on delivering.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/08/tennis-french-open-2023-semi-finals-muchova-sabalenka-swiatek-haddad-maia-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "French Open: Swiatek beats Haddad Maia to set up final with Muchova \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "Karolina Muchova upset Aryna Sabalenka in a three-set classic and will meet Iga Swiatek in the final, the defending champion and world No 1, seeing off Beatriz Haddad Maia in another fine match", "author": "Daniel Harris", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T19:09:45Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897041", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e4bb0e22ffb0a7344a7d5e919fcf874ca9f25ae2/0_128_5000_3001/500.jpg", "body": "That, then, is us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thanks all for your company, and please do join me tomorrow from 1pm BST for \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Carlos Alcaraz [1] v Novak Djokovic [3] and Casper Ruud [4] v Alexander Zverev [22]. Decent! Swiatek is delighted to reach her third Roland-Garros final in four years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tough to play such a tough tournament, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excited for Saturday now. Asked why Haddad Maia gave her more trouble than anyone else, she replies with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my God!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd then says she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sure so soon after the match but offers her leftyness, ability to hit with lots of spin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good for clay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and courage. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pleased to have played so well in the breaker, having not done so well in them recently, and asked if she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s changing anything for the final, reckons if you get there, you should keep doing what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing and the aim is to treat it like any other match. She hopes for a good, entertaining match, then thanks the crowd even if she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sure they were shouting Bea or Iga, prior to addressing her countryfolk in Polish. Now, though, i guess she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off for some lebowski, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see her again in the final. Haddad Maia might just\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made a breakthrough these last two weeks. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proved to herself that she can compete against anyone, and her power-touch game is very well-suited to Wimbledon. Another fantastic match, finished by Swiatek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forehand. One to the corner from the back, then another to the same corner from the net, and Haddad Maia looks gutted and well she might \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she thought she was going to win that set, but the best players find their best tennis at the best moments, and Swiatek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s belief got her through that. She meets Muchova in the final, and if both play as they did today, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a serious contest. Swiatek 6-2 6-6 Haddad Maia (8-7) Oh yes! Backhands of impeccable length from Swiatek but then she unfathomably changes it up, a tentative forehand tempting her opponent to try for a forehand winner \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and she nails it! Wow! It was there for her, but match-point down, she might\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve hedged; she did not, unloading the suitcase and reaping the rewards. Except Swiatek, playing from memory now, unleashes an awesome forehand cross-court, and now hasa second match point, this time on her own serve\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Swiatek 6-2 6-6 Haddad Maia (7-6) She can, and Haddad Maia quickly nets; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not a clue who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to win this breaker because neither woman is playing consistently enough to look reliable. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as high quality a match as the first semi but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty exciting, and as i type that, Swiatek crouches low to send a glorious backhand winner spinning cross-court to raise match point\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Swiatek 6-2 6-5 Haddad Maia (6-6) Haddad Maia botches a pretty simple putaway, but it shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t discourage her because she was there to win that point and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on her serve. But then she balloons a forehand that is, and that thing top players do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c somehow win when apparently playing poorly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looks almost inevitable. Except Swiatek goes long again, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set point Haddad Maia; can the world no1 find a first serve? Swiatek 6-2 6-5 Haddad Maia (3-5) Immediately, Swiatek retrieves the situation when Haddad Maia shanks a forehand long, but a long backhand shortly afterwards and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5-3! Suddenly, a decider looks imminent! Swiatek 6-2 6-6 Haddad Maia (2-3) Oh yes! A backhand down the line, Swiatek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security blanket, gets her out of trouble when down 0-1 and behind in the next rally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c her forehand is giving her grief again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and so\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s her ball-toss. Then, at 2-2, Haddad Maia hangs in there until the error comes, and will now serve a point in front with the mini-break\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Swiatek 6-2 6-6 Haddad Maia* Swiatek goes long on the forehand, but then a good return onto the line forces her into the next rally and eventually \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after a couple of good shotas, to be fair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Haddad Maia nets. And have a look! Swiatek coaxes a backhand down the line with love and force for a clean winner and 15-30 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only to wildly thrash a return to who knows where. Then, on 30-all, Swiatek misses the sideline by fractions with an inside-out backhand, before Haddad Maia monsters a forehand down the line to earn her breaker, and isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t she pleased with herself for that! Swiatek* 6-2 6-5 Haddad Maia A love-hold for Swiatek, who looked really purposeful in that game. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d not be at all surprised if she finishes the match with a break when Haddad Maia serves in a sec. Swiatek 6-2 5-5 Haddad Maia* A double gives Swiatek 15-all \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 no it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, a check revealing the second second serve to be on the line. For all the difference it makes, Haddad Maia sending a forehand long \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 before soft hands at the net give her 30-15. From there, she quickly closes out, and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so amped \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great to see. Swiatek* 6-2 5-4 Haddad Maia Swiatek finds herself 15-30, swipes a backhand wide, and suddenly she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in trouble! Not for long: a backhand winner and service winner follow \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but then a backhand drops long \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but then Haddad Maia goes long, and how vexed is she! She knew that was a chance, her third break point burned \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fairness to Swiatek, though, she did land her second serve on the line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and shonuff she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soon sitting down, prior to serving to stay in the tournament. Swiatek 6-2 4-4 Haddad Maia* Though this is the game in which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m expecting a break, Muchova will be watching wondering if maybe, just maybe she can, because Swiatek, though she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing well enough to win, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t playing all that well. She does, though, make 15-3o thanks to two errors from Haddad Maia, who levels the game with a terrific forehand down the line. Swiatek then dumps a backhand unnecessarily, loops a forehand that sits up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the Brazilian splatters a winner for a crucial hold. Swiatek* 6-2 4-3 Haddad Maia Swiatek is hitting through her forehand again, quickly making 30-0 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but Haddad Maia then opens her shoulders, a forehand winner then another levelling the game. And have a look! Forced onto one knee to respond to a shot of testing length, Swiatek can only go long so must now face another break point \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then a serve onto the edge of the box facilitates a clean-up forehand for deuce. And from there, Swiatek cleans up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the help of a net-cord. Swiatek 6-2 3-3 Haddad Maia* Back on her game, Swiatek moves Haddad Maia about the baseline then rams a forehand winner into the space she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s created for 15-all. Haddad Maia, though, behind in the next rally, collars a forehand winner down the line \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then Swiatek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forehand, back in the match, makes 30-all and an error from the Brazilian \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fairness, after being dragged about again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c means she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facing break-back point. And a decent return from the no1 seed sees a forehand riposte sent wide, which is to say that normal service is resumed. Swiatek* 6-2 2-3 Haddad Maia Swiatek pastes a forehand onto the line for 30-15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make her feel better \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then Haddad Maia clouts a return long, just. At 40-15, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trouble with the ball-toss, and a big forehand makes 40-30, but then a strong serve is returned long and Swiatek hangs on. Swiatek 6-2 1-3 Haddad Maia* Haddad Maia is feeling herself now and Swiatek looks a little tentative \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I guess when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got high standards and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a little off them, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still playing well. So Haddad Maia makes 30-0 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then a fantastic forehand return cross-court breaks the sideline for a clean winner, Swiatek reminding herself of who she is and what she does \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only to make two more forehand errors, the second a real shank from mid-court, and suddenly this match has changed! Swiatek* 6-2 1-2 Haddad Maia Lots of players have all the shots; what sets Swiatek apart, I think, is her consistency \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brilliant of course, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think she does much we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not seen before. But a double and a forehand error, responding to one of great power and length, give Haddad Maia 30-all, and a forehand into the net \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not even the top of it either \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hand over a break point. This could be the match right here, because Swiatek won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer up too many chances \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the Brazilian only needs one, a forehand dropping long! Here we go! Swiatek 6-2 1-1 Haddad Maia* Swiatek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s level has dropped a bit, and Jo reckons leaving the arena between sets won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have helped. I can see that, but perhaps she needed something? Anyhow, at 30-0 she works Haddad Maia from side to side, then unleashes a brutal forehand winner down the line, but the Brazilian closes out well and is on the board in set two. Swiatek* 6-2 1-0 Haddad Maia It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to see a way for Haddad Maia, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outmatched in pretty much every department. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got the lefty serve, but other than that, though she might have the power edge, Swiatek has more than enough of her own, and better wheels, hands and eyes. Still, the Brazilian hits a good forehand winner for 30-15, then a mishit gives her 40-30 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 after which Swiatek goes wide; deuce it is, and Haddad Maia sets up then plays a lovely volley for advantage! But facing a second serve, she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get enough action on the ball, larruping a forehand long, and a fine forehand means game-point Swiatek \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 except a double follows. For all the difference it makes: Switek burns an advantage, then quickly secures the hold. Swiatek 6-2 Haddad Maia* A double hands Swiatek 15-30, then sent to the corner she hoists a lob of perfect length which allows her to thrash back a forehand winner. Haddad Maia then goes long and her breaking to love in game one feels a long time ago. Swiatek* 5-2 Haddad Maia Minor controversy as Haddad Maia plays a ball that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s out, sending her response out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she contends the call came prior to, but the point goes to Swiatek. And the next, superb defence allowing her forehand to take over and elicit the error. Haddad Maia, though, then runs around her backhand to muscle a second serve down the line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not at all daunted by the opponent or occasion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but swiatek is just too good, a backhand winner securing a three-game lead. Swiatek 4-2 Haddad Maia* Swiatek lands one on the chalk and the bounce incites Haddad Maia to go long. But a backhand down the line makes 15-all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Swiatek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s response drifts long \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and at 30-all, good chasing from the Brazilian means she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still in the rally to power a backhand that hits the service-line and dies. Swiatek, though, keeps doing what she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing to make deuce, Haddad Maia misses a forehand down the line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c here comes another break point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then slices a risky backhand into the tape. Swiatek breaks, and that reflects the balance of play \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clearly superior, dictating the majority of rallies. Swiatek* 3-2 Haddad Maia In a sense, this match is the opposite of the one we just saw: here, the higher-ranked player is the one with all the shots and varieties, while the lower-ranked one has the big shots. Which isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to say Swiatek can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit it hard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she can, though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not entirely clear where the power comes from \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an all-rounder. Should she win here, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m certain she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d prefer to meet Muchova, a less-good version of herself, than Sabalenka, who has the tools to hit her off the court, but in the meantime she doubles for 30-all; can Haddad Maia make something of it? Er no, a pair of winners, the second a gorgeous top-spin forehand taken off the tootsies, secure the game and though she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not hit her best level yet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c today or this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 70% of her is more than enough for most players. Swiatek 2-2 Haddad Maia* Thanks Michael. If Haddad Maia is to make a match of this, she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to be broken again, but soon finds herself down 0-30. A big serve halves the arrears, though, then a really good point, dictated by big groundstrokes and finished with a volley, makes 30-all. We wind up at deuce, then Swiatek goes long before Haddad Maia punishes a forehand to win a point in which she was behind. This is boiling nicely. Daniel is back from his break, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll hand back over now. Enjoy the rest of the match. Swiatek* 2-1 Haddad Maia Swiakek holds, but it is Haddad Maia who is showing some enterprise from the back of the court. On the very rare occasions where Swiatek does lose, it is normally to aggressive opponents who play on the front foot. That means Haddad Maia has to make some difficult shots, but the Brazilian is very capable of that. Swiatek 1-1 Haddad Maia* Swiatek responds. Of course she does. Haddad Maia is such a clean-striking lefty, but Swiatek attacks the second serve, dictates the rallies, and breaks back with ease, forcing a couple of errant shots. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back on serve. Swiatek* 0-1 Haddad Maia Haddad Maia breaks to love! Woooooooow. It is the Brazilian that look like the tournament favourite, taking the first game with some stylish swishes of the racket, including two ridiculously powerful return winners, the latter and decisive one off a first serve. Quite the opening statement. Some breaking Brit-based news for you, courtesy of PA. Jack Draper will miss Wimbledon with the shoulder injury he suffered at the French Open last week. It is a huge blow to the 21-year-old, whose progress has been disrupted by a series of injuries. The latest came in practice ahead of his first-round clash at Roland Garros last Monday against Tomas Etcheverry, with Draper forced to serve underarm before calling it a day after only one game of the second set. While hugely disappointed that his body had again let him down, Draper was optimistic the problem with his left shoulder would not disrupt his grass-court campaign too much. However, having had a scan and seen a specialist, Draper has decided to miss the whole of the British summer season. Draper wrote on Instagram: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear my shoulder is going to need time and rehab to get back to where it needs to be. My team and I have made the difficult decision to miss the grass court season this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I guess in this sport there are so many ups and downs but this one is tough to take. The only thing for sure is that I will keep persevering.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He is optimistic he will not need surgery and is hoping to return to the match court in mid to late July. When he has been fit, Draper has shown he has the potential to be among the best in the world but that has not been nearly as often as he would have liked. Last season a promising run to the third round of the US Open was ended by a leg injury and, after illness disrupted his pre-season, Draper has already missed large chunks of this year with hip and abdominal problems. In Paris last week the Londoner said he felt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mentally destroyed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hate being the guy who is injured a lot.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Draper made his Wimbledon debut in 2021, losing to Novak Djokovic, while last year he pushed Alex De Minaur to four sets in the second round. Swiatek has won every set this tournament, and taken just five hours and 30 minutes to reach this semi-final. The world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best player is in frightening form. A moment/minute\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silence is observed for the victims of a knife attack, which took place in Annecy this morning. Hi everyone. What a match that was. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hoping we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be treated to something similar with Swiatek v Haddad Maia. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth remembering that these two have met once before, last year in Toronto, and it was the Brazilian who came out on top in a three-hour, three-set epic. Swiatek looks very focused as the players come out on Chatrier. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure anyone could accuse the No 1 seed of looking complacent. Lots of Brazilian support in the stands, though. This should be a good one. Phew. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to take a little break; Michael Butler will croon you through the start of our second semi, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back presently. Coming up next: Iga Swiatek [1] v Beatriz Haddad Maia [14]. Niiiiiice! As for Sabalenka, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be feeling very poorly for a very long time. She had the match not just on her racket but in her pocket, relaxed, left the door open, and had her house ransacked. When she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calmed down, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll remember that she played well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it took a fine player playing the game of her life to beat her and even then she had to help her \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be hurting, bad. Muchova is really quite calm, calmer than me, saying hi to everyone and that she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know what happened \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she just tried to keep fighting and she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so happy. Complimented on her game and how natural it is with all its variations, she admits that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been told similar before, but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want it to get into her head so she stays humble. She notes that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a team effort, thanking those who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve helped her get to here, and reckons it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to play on a court this good in a match so big. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredible feeling to here people cheering and calling her name, and on Saturday, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll meet Iga Swiatek or Bea Haddad Maia in the final! My absolute complete and utter days, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earned it. What a player, what a competitor, what a match! What a game of tennis! What a game of anything! Not long after missing seven months, a a backhand down the line and Muchova reaches her first Grand Slam final having won five games in a row \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just as Sabalenka lost them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pinching a classic for the ages. That was brilliant brilliant brilliant, and Muchova\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intelligence in coming up with a plan, her skill in executing it and her moxie in coming back were stupendous. Muchova* 7-6(5) (5)6-7 6-5 (40-0) Sabalenka Muchova makes 15-0 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won 14 of the last 20 points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but unlike many of Sabalenka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pre-Melbourne defeats, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not because the pressure got big on her, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because she assumed she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d done enough. Er, not so old mate. Muchova quickly makes 30-0 when a return goes out, then draws Sablenka to the net with a drop \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 which she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t return! Three match points Muchova! Muchova 7-6(5) (5)6-7 6-5 Sabalenka* Sabalenka belts a forehand long then gets herself a fresh racket. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be raging at herself because she knows this match should be over, but she also knows how hard it is to close out, and at 15-all, Muchova comes in on a second serve to try and increase pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to no avail. Sabalenka looks by far the stronger player, but at 15-40 she sends down a double, then a fault \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then another! A double-double \u00e2\u20ac\u201c her third, while Muchova hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t served any \u00e2\u20ac\u201c means deuce, then Saba thrashes a half-court backhand long! There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been so many errors these last few games and now Muchova, who looked beaten 10 minutes ago, has a point to serve for the match! And serve for the match she will because when Sabalenka frames one, she charges in, lashes a forehand winner, and what on earth is going on?! What a lesson this is for the no2 seed: give someone your little finger, they take your entire hand. Muchova* 7-6(5) (5)6-7 5-5 Sabalenka Muchova is so, so weary, but somehow mind prevails over body and she holds to love! My days she needed that, and in co-comms Chris notes that at 5-2, Sabalenka played a slightly lazy game, allowing Muchova some impetus, and now look! Muchova 7-6(5) (5)6-7 4-5 Sabalenka* Oh wow, Muchova moves out of court to ram a forehand winner down the line, then at 15-all Sabalenka nets and at 15-30 thwacks long \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 way long! I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting so careless a game, despite the pressure, and as I type that Sabalenka swipes a backhand wide! That was dreadful, and as the clock ticks past three hours, the match, already a classic, remains in the balance! Muchova* 7-6(5) (5)6-7 3-5 Sabalenka Muchova doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the kaiach to keep at this, quickly down 0-30. But a gift from Sabalenka hands her a foothold and a decent second serve, right onto the line, forces a drop that sits up and begs to be despatched; 30-all. But a backhand slice floated long means match point \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and Muchova finds a first serve, then larrups a forehand from corner to corner, making deuce, holding on from there for her hold. Sabalenka will have to serve for it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Muchova 7-6(5) (5)6-7 2-5 Sabalenka* Sabalenka didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play Wimbledon last year because Belarusians \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and, of course, Russians \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were banned. So she went to Florida and got herself fitter, work that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s paying for itself now. At 30-all she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still got the strength to clobber groundstrokes, the two contacting the net-cord three times between them, before a sensational backhand, oblique and breaking the sideline, ends the longest point of the match, then an ace follows and Sabalenka is a game away! Muchova* 7-6(5) (5)6-7 2-4 Sabalenka Muchova badly needs a first serve here because make no mistake, Sabalenka is a killer who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have noted her fatigue. Naturally, she sends a decent delivery out wide \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only to overhit her clean-up! Is she flagging? Is this the beginning of the end? Er, no mate, Sabalenka makes consecutive errors, the second a really tame backhand that floats long; er maybe, she hits a big forehand which yields a moon ball that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nowhere near anywhere; 30-all. So Muchova responds with her sixth ace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been there almost every time she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really needed it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only for Sabalenka to make deuce by punishing a pair of forehands, then advantage via backhand return and backhand winner. Magnificent behaviour, raising break point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3/11, Muchova 3/3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and facing a second serve, she launches herself into the rally and her opponent can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond! Might that be the decisive blow? Muchova looks really tired now. Muchova 7-6(5) (5)6-7 2-3 Sabalenka* Muchova curls a forehand winner cross-court for 0-15, then Sabalenka nets a forehand and has momentum shifted again? 0-30! Er no, three consecutive errors from Muchova make 30-40 and is she tiring? She can be excused for it if she is, flexing legs while waiting to receive, but the rejuvenating power of a double for deuce means she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s soon hammering a forehand return \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 which Sabalenka sends back at her with interest for a clean winner, quickly securing the game thereafter. She looks to be lasting the better, but the line between success and failure is so thin it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to say with any certainty who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll win this. Muchova* 7-6(5) (5)6-7 2-2 Sabalenka No doubt there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be plenty on the tour wondering if they can do what Muchova\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing, but for it to work, it requires precision, power, composure and nerve, so all the best with that. Anyroad up, at 15-all Sabalenka opens the space for a forehand winner only to overhit it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Chrissy notes that she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to go for lines \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially as, given the situation, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely to pull things a little. We get to 30-all, though, then on game point Muchova plays a lush drop, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough for final-set parity. Muchova 7-6(5) (5)6-7 1-2 Sabalenka* \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh my word!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd yells Chrissy when, at 30-0, Muchova is dragged over to the forehand side, responding with a leaping, stretching forehand winner down the line. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re motivating each other, bringing each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best games out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just wonderful to watch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And she should know \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on which point do check out BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s God of Tennis series, which is a lot of fun. One of the things I most loved was her explaining that she just responds well to pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c imagine being able to say that of yourself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while, back in the present, Sabalenka holds to 15. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still nary a Rizla blue in it,but she looks the better player at the moment. Muchova* 7-6(5) (5)6-7 1-1 Sabalenka Now then. Two errors from Muchova \u00e2\u20ac\u201c prompted by good play by Sabalenka \u00e2\u20ac\u201c give the favourite a sniff, and a forehand winner, whipped from centre to corner, cross-court, raise three break points. You know, though, that Muchocva won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get feart, and she saves two then faults; Sabalenka steps in. So Muchova tries a kicker down the middle, the return lands on the chalk, is backed up with a fine forehand \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and look at that! A gorgeous forehand down the line makes deuce and Muchova has serious moxie. Oh yes she does! Sabalenka earns advantage with a jazzer of a forehand, backpeddling having invited her opponent to the net \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so that opponent lamps an ace down the middle \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then with advantage of her own, does it again! \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Staggeringly good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says our commentator, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right. Karolina Muchova is forreal. Muchova 7-6(5) (5)6-7 0-1 Sabalenka* It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silly, but I love that both sets finished 7-6(5) because it illustrates just how close this match has been. Before this game, Sabalenka had won one more point than Muchova and at 40-15 looks to be forging ahead in the match, but a fine get forces her to spin 360, hitting an extra ball \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s laughing as she does it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then Muchova puts a way a volley to give her something about which to think. Not for long, she quickly closes out, and now Muchova must respond, but under the pressure of being behind. Sabalenka guzzles a second serve, slamming a backhand cross-court, then a big forehand sets up the overhead and though she manages to direct it at her opponent, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good enough because Muchova nets. Another fantastic set of glorious tennis is over \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 now here comes another! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind if we do! Muchova 7-6(5) 6-6 (5-6) Sabalenka Oh Saba! Oh man! She wins her first point but then up 6-4, she sends down a double! One go left, but on the Muchova serve\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Muchova 7-6(5) 6-6 (4-5) Sabalenka But then Sabalenka overhits a forehand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that needed more spin so might\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been nerves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then Muchova dumps another backhand! Sabalenka has two serves to make it 1-1\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Muchova 7-6(5) 6-6 (2-4) Sabalenka You know what? As soon as this match is finished, we get to watch another! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a bad old life (sometimes). Muchova, though, is disappointed to stick a nondescript backhand into the net, and it makes me double-take because of how rarely that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened previously, and next point Sabalenka rocks back and carts a luscious forehand into the corner for the mini-break, consolidated with a booming serve. The decider the match \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and more importantly we \u00e2\u20ac\u201c deserve looks imminent. Muchova 7-6(5) 6-6 Sabalenka* A bazzing first point of the game, Sabalenka playing a monster and Muchova forcing her to hit four more balls than she might\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done. She holds to love, though \u00e2\u20ac\u201c game point also features a variety of gets before falling to her \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got ourselves another breaker. Can Muchova stay as calm during it as she did during the first, now the final is within reach? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unkind to call Sabalenka a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmindless ball basher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (in the style of say Tsonga or Berdych in times gone by),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd returns James Wilson, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but Muchova rather makes her look like that today with her brilliance. Sablenka has taken major strides to fix her serve and just hammer the ball off both sides but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s looking back to what she was this time last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all the shots, but little variety and patience. Credit to Muchova for forcing her to revert to her 2022 vintage. A long way to go though still.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yup, it feels like she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s turned up assuming that if she does what she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been doing she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll win, rather than gameplanning for what Muchova might do. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s played lots of pressure=points well though. Muchova* 7-6(5) 6-5 Sabalenka Muchova has served superbly today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done everything superbly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and she holds to 15, forcing Sabalenka to serve to stay in the tournament once again. P-R-E-S-S-U-R-E. Muchova 7-6(5) 5-5 Sabalenka* Muchova does make 0-15, but Sabalenka unleashes from mid-court until her opponent can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take any more, then disburses a violent ace out wide for 40-15 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then another down the T for 5-5! She backs herself now, which makes the quality of Muchova\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play even more impressive. Muchova* 7-6(5) 5-4 Sabalenka Yeah, about me saying momentum had switched; perhaps not. A straightforward hold for Muchova, and now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m wondering if we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll look back at today as the time a new force in the game announced itself. Sabalenka must now serve to stay in the competition. Muchova 7-6(5) 4-4 Sabalenka* I said just a second ago that no one plays perfectly for an entire match, but Muchova is playing this match perfectly, drawing Sabalenka to the net, where she misses a volley for 15-40, then taking pace off the ball before upping it when she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready, forcing the error! This is intense, compelling, affirming stuff. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flies like a buatterfly, stings like a bee weak gag in here somewhere, Muchova deriving from the Slavonic word for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dchouse fly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - Mucha/Muha. Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flies known for how quickly they can, well, fly? Their aeronautical design via nature is pretty sweet. A bit like Karolina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get my coat).\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I believe the genus was named after her. Muchova* 7-6(5) 3-4 Sabalenka Yup, she has a go, but with her back half-turned as she digs out a backhand from the corner, Muchova sneaks to the net in order to despatch a volley. Sabalenka, though, makes 15-all with a drop that just about clambers over the net, and when her opponent guides an approach wide, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two points from a break. And, though, Muchova then levels the game, a barrage of backhands give her 30-40 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 except, and yet again, Muchova finds her best gear when she needs to, working her way to the net for a put-away. Problem being she needs to do likewise immediately afterwards because she sends a forehand long, and this time Sabalenka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power is too much, a sensational backhand return, annihilated cross-court, setting up a backhand winner. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the break, and I wonder if momentum has shifted here, not because Muchova isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t playing well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she is \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but because no one can play perfectly for an entire match and the world no2 has turned it up. Muchova 7-6(5) 3-3 Sabalenka* Sabalenka has stepped it up here, landing a lot of first serves and making the match the one she wants to play rather than the one Muchova is forcing her to play. She holds to 15, sealing the deal with a lovely backhand caressed down the line, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect her to attack the serve in the next game. Muchova* 7-6(5) 3-2 Sabalenka Sabalenka wallops a forehand to get 30-15, so Muchova slams an ace down the middle and quickly closes out. Muchova 7-6(5) 2-2 Sabalenka* I talk about this a lot, but we may have reached the mythical stage of both players playing well at the same time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c deploying contrasting yet complementary styles too. Sabalenka makes 40-0 in typical style, but out of nowhere Muchova fights back to deuce, hitting through her in the process. From there, though, she closes out, and this is the best match I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in absolutely tiiiiiiiime. Muchova* 7-6(5) 2-1 Sabalenka So she tries a drop, it works, and she makes 0-15 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so Muchova redeems the situation with an ace down the T. Her timing today has been faultless, but Saba isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t who she is for no reason and her forehand earns her the next two points for 15-40. Muchova, though, responds with a telling drop, only for two more forehands, a return and a winner, restoring parity in set two. A year ago, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure Sabalenka is capable of that, but she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very serious proposition nowadays. Muchova 7-6(5) 2-0 Sabalenka* Muchova punishes a weak second serve for 15-all, then Sabalenka sends a backhand long.As Chrissy notes, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answering every question she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s asked, wearing the power and using her lightness of foot to keep her opponent off balance. And forcing another error, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got 15-40, then sticks a forehand return onto the line, and Sabalenka can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t respond! Mucxhova leads by a set and a break, and suddenly the no2 seed looks bereft of ideas! Muchova* 7-6(5) 1-0 Sabalenka That was so impressive from Muchova. Obviously there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the skill required to play like that, along with the confidence to try things, but more than anything it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the temperament that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s striking \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at no point did she get tight. And she holds to love, closing the game with a serve-volley point, stretching for a lovely, controlled putaway. Muchova 7-6(5) Sabalenka Sabalenka comes in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Muchova\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tactics have forced her to change her own \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and when she goes long, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s set-point down, though on her own serve. And Muchova plays it brilliantly, stretching to loop a return close to the line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c intentionally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before a backhand cross-court opens a backhand down the line, a clean winner that is a fitting end to a fantastic set (of tennis). The underdog leads, and the no2 seed has some thinking to do! Muchova 6-6 Sabalenka (5-5) Sabalenka hits the line with a second serve, then does likewise with the forehand that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behind it, and when she cracks a forehand just wide, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not a clue who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to shade this. Muchova 6-6 Sabalenka (4-3) Immediately, Muchova snaffles a mini-break, a fine forehand return, cross-court and punkt into the corner, eliciting the error. We then progress to 3-2, a monstrous forehand then another good one arranging a volley for 4-2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Muchova is winning more points behind her second serve than her first, which is ridiculous, especially against this opponent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but then Sabelnka plays a nice approach, puts a nervy overhead onto the line, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back on serve. Muchova* 6-6 Sabalenka Oooh yeah! Muchova comes in and this time Sabalenka is ready for her, unleashing a forehand pass that leaves burn marks on my screen. No matter, a gorgeous backhand down the line makes 15-all \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I love the way Muchova plays these shots, almost ushering the ball rather than hitting it because her footwork and timing are so good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a drop soon gives her 40-15, Sabalenka marooned behind the baseline. So next point she batters away then comes in \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only to net her volley, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got ourselves the breaker we and both players deserve. Muchova 5-6 Sabalenka* Breaking back like that will have given Sabalenka even more confidence, but at 30-15 Muchove plays a drop-winner then, second-best in the next point, hoists a momentum-switching lob only to hit the top of the net when poised to make 30-all. That was a thrilling rally but, and we looks ready for another when Muchova sends a lovely return down the line, but this time it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sabalenka who guides from behind her and whence it came \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Muchova slips, which tells you how little she was expecting that ball, there, though she wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have got it in any case. Muchova* 5-5 Sabalenka Sabalenka makes 0-15 then hammers away from the back, except right as 0-30 looks imminent, Muchova comes in and despatches a terrific backhand volley before guiding a forehand into the corner for 30-15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in comms, the think this is Federer-liked. Sabalenka, though, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic, coming in so Muchova couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t to paste a forehand winner of her own, but again the Czech responds, a fine serve backed up with a forehand which raises set point! So Sabalenka ups the power, disbursing further mighty forehands for deuce, then again so she can clean up at the net, and now she has a chance to break back! Again, Muchova finds a first serve, but this time Sabalenka spanks a return close to the line, eliciting the error, and that is a champion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour. This is a really enjoyable tussle, engaging brain as well as heart. Muchova 5-4 Sabalenka* More power off from Muchova and Sabalenka, coming in, botches her putaway at the net. She does make 15-all, but now Muchova approaches the net, inviting the pass, and Sabalenka can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t; then, from 15-30, she comes in again, twice, and both times finishes points, one with a forehand volley and one with a flowing forehands into the corner, both times having opened the court with clever angles, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the break! Muchova will now serve for the first set! Muchova* 4-4 Sabalenka Sabalenka gets to 0-15 and then smokes a return down the line; Muchova responds well, finding a really good length, but then whams a forehand into tape for 0-30. She needs to steady here and does, making 30-all in short order, and looks to be enjoying the contest confident that she belongs; again, she finds great length, it prompts Sabalenka to drop a little short, and she comes in to stroke a forehand winner into the corner then quickly closes out. This is an absorbing contest, and if it comes down to a few points in a breaker, Muchova has a serious chance of causing an upset. Muchova 3-4 Sabalenka* Has anyone ever hit the ball harder than Sabalenka? There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Serena, obviously, and in the game now Rybakina and Ostapenko. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure any of them go as hard and as flat as often. But hang on, Muchova digs one out from behind her in the backhand corner, forcing Sabalenka to play another shot, and her overhead goes out! 30-all and another mini-chance, quickly extinguished with a service winner and a netted volley running in. However, prior to missing the putaway, Muchova played an excellent point and will be pretty happy with how things are going. Muchova* 3-3 Sabalenka Muchova is doing a pretty good job of landing her first serve and Sabalenka hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite found her timing on the return yet. She gets to 40-0 and even when she nets a slice, Chrissy praises her for changing the pace, then Saba slaps into the net and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re back level. This is shaping up into a decent contest. Muchova 2-3 Sabalenka* Sabalenka thrashes away as Muchova scurries and slides to hither and yon, doing a good job without ever looking likely to threaten the serve. A hold to 15, and the no2 seed looks extremely imposing. Muchova* 2-2 Sabalenka Yup, Muchova plans to mix things up, serve-volleying on the first point of the game \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sabalenka nets her return \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before caning an ace down the T for 30-0. She does then go wide with an inside-out forehand, but a cunningly-placed forehand, looping into the corner, takes her close to 2-2 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then Sabalenka collars her second serve, humping a winner cross-court for 40-30. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have known she needs to land her first effort if she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to compete here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when Sabalenka has a go at another, she hits long and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deuce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but even when she does, to the forehand, the ball comes scorches straight back past her, raising the first break point of the match. Muchova, though, responds well, sending down another ace \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only to net on the forehand immediately afterwards \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only to respond well again, targeting the backhand to come in which works nicely. Deuce it is, Muchova sends to the backhand corner and spiriting a fine flick cross-court with soft wrists and hands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sabalenka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s volley falls wide, just \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then closes out. On the one hand, she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want many tight holds like that but, on the other, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feel good that she saw it out. Muchova 1-2 Sabalenka* Muchova gets to 30-all and in the circumstances this is a chance. Muchova, as we thought she might, slows down the pace of things, forcing Sabalenka to generate her own power \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if she wants to. Which she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u201c instead she comes in slices a gorgeous drop, then on game-point monsters consecutive forehands, illustrating the conundrum of facing her perfectly: how do you beat someone who can hit it harder than you, who also has a better touch than you? Muchova* 1-1 Sabalenka A solid start from Muchova,b ut then at 40-15 Sabalenka runs in and from mid-court slices a lovely backhand winner cross-court to the forehand corner. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing with almost indecent confidence, but when she spanks a forehand from the back it drops fractionally long and Muchova is on the board. Meantime, Chrissy notes that Saba is kinder to herself now, allowing points she doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win to pass without chastising her behaviour. On which point, to learn how to practise self-compassion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and other helpful behaviours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c check out the work of Dr Shefali Tsabary. Muchova 0-1 Sabalenka* (*denotes server) I love the simplicity of Sabalenka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so little movement, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just toss, set, bend, whack. She starts nicely too, a big topspin forehand winner giving her 40-15 and the game sealed with an ace. And \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 play. Absolute sake dept: Chatrier, though buzzing, is a long way off full. What is wrong with people? Sabalenka goes to No1 in the world if she wins the competition or if Swiatek loses today. She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yet to lose a set in the competition, and her last two wins, over Sloane Stephens and Elina Svitolina, were extremely impressive. As I alluded to earlier, Muchova recently had seven months off with an abdominal injury, so being out there now must be gravy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hawksmoor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bone marrow gravy, no less. Muchova wins the toss and, as per the present vogue, opts to receive. The idea is, I imagine, to put an opponent under pressure while settling oneself. The wind\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kicking up a little which might help Muchova \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be looking for points of difference \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but on the other hand it might help Sabalenka, who can hit either with it or through it. Here come our players! What I will say is that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more chance Muchova beats Sabalenka than Haddad Maia beats Swiatek, partly because Sabalenka is still Sabalenka \u00e2\u20ac\u201c her new-found confidence isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t yet fully entrenched \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but also because Muchova has more to offer that might cause trouble. Haddad Maia has nice hands and serious power, I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough of either to see off Swiatek. Watching a further interview with Muchova, she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t share her tactics but does seem to fancy herself. My guess is she tries to keep Sabalenka moving so that she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plant her feet and whack, which\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll mean drops, lobs, balls to the corners and variations of pace, spin and angle. Wow. Wow wow wow wow. We see some VT of Muchova, who says reaching the final in Rome a couple of weeks ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she lost to Badosa \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and though she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the kind of person who wants everything now, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happy to have made the semi here eventually but of course still wants more. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure Casper Ruud will win the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s competition, but he absolutely strolls the best tan-line contest. Salut! And welcome to Roland-Garros 2023 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c day 12! I like these calm little moments before the storm. It reminds me of Beethoven. Can you hear it? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like, when you put your head to the grass. You can hear it growing. You can hear the insects, bzzzz ... Do you like Beethoven? So said Norman Stansfield in L\u00c3\u00a9on and, though he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talking about our women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s semi-final matches \u00e2\u20ac\u201c probably \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he might\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been. Because on the face of things, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no tension here as we know exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to happen: Aryna Sabaklenka blazes through Karol\u00c3\u00adna Muchov\u00c3\u00a1 and Iga Swiatek devastates Beatriz Haddad Maia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the kind of light work best soundtracked by Mozart \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then the two winners convene on Saturday for an absolute Brahms of a final. But sport \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tennis in particular \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tend not to work that way. After a miserable time with injury, Muchov\u00c3\u00a1 will feel that her time is now, and knows that not long ago, Sabalenka was a fragile thwacker liable to falter under pressure. If she plays to her maximum, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll fancy her chances of reminding her reborn opponent exactly who she used used to be. Haddad Maia is a not dissimilar tigela de moqueca, a powerful hitter with hands and belief at her physical peak. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to discomfit Swiatek, especially on clay, but the Brazilian is here because she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hit purple patches in each of her last two matches, and she can find that level today, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a problem. Most likely, of course, the favourites do enough \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though neither has been seriously tested in reaching this stage. Swiatek, the defending champion, the reigning US Open champion and the world No 1, is a generational talent with disquieting equanimity and no weaknesses. Real talk, she seems impregnable on clay \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 except Sabalenka is in majestically murderous form, assaulting the ball like it just called her mum a rude word and fortified, since winning the Australian Open, with all the confidence that eluded her in the years prior to that. Or, put another way, this going to be good \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and what comes next might be even better. On y va!

In a music and media industry in need of catchy frameworks (guilty), defining the season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banger has become a yearly pastime, but 2023 was starting to feel a bit nervy. Pundits have been reaching for tracks such as Calvin Harris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Miracle, Fifty Fifty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cupid and PinkPantheress\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Boy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a Liar, which, while all excellent, were released in the depths of winter and thus can never be songs of the summer, spiritually speaking. Dave and Central Cee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spry Sprinter released last week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most-streamed song in a single day in 2023 so far, on Spotify in the UK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c felt like the first proper contender with its guitar wafting like a warm breeze, but can a song with the line \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this gyal want me in her uterus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ever really have the requisite carefree vibe? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all academic now anyway: nothing is likely to be as potently, Cornetto-ly summery this season as Who Told You, the new single from east London rapper J Hus, with Drake, the patron saint of the summer jam, dropping in to guest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who told you bad man don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dance?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd J Hus asks at the outset, making those pseudo-hard blokes you see in the club, performatively standing stock still while eking out a Corona, look very silly indeed. His song goes on to be about the very pleasure of dancing, in particular dancing close to someone hot, a chief joy of summer. J Hus has established himself as \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this high praise is warranted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the greatest musicians of his generation, someone as good at self-deprecation as he is braggartly posturing, who has a casual omnipotence whatever type of beat is tossed his way. That greatness lies in the very way he works with those beats: a kind of dance in itself with Hus leading, moving in time with a rhythm but never dominated by it. Take the way he raps, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She wore that tight dress just to enhance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, slipping imperceptibly behind the beat (just as he previously did with, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a rolling stone like Mick Jagger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Fortune Teller). Hus doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plod dutifully along: he walks his own path. Drake turns up in full tourist garb, wearing a semi-Jamaican accent and British slang \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Your backside is so fit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like someone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just bought a wide-brimmed comedy straw hat from a beachside cabana. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been doing this so long now that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s become an authentic Drake mode, and his meandering singsong delivery, really closer to jazz vocals than any other genre, is such a pleasure. The way he sings \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trouble will find me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and then repeats the line with tiny gaps added between the words to emphasise the certainty of trouble finding him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like Hus, this is such detailed and freely expressive songcraft. He and J Hus also have an emotional history: it was Drake who gave him a moving homecoming moment in front of 20,000 people at an O2 Arena concert in 2019, after he had been released from prison. The Afrobeats rhythm by producer P2J is nimble and fleet of foot, inviting subtle bum shakes rather than outright twerks or lairy raised arms, as some songs of the UK summer can do. Last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equivalent was probably Burna Boy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Last Last, which was equally rhythmically sophisticated; what with the huge success of Libianca\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s People this year (whose sad mien made it very much the song of the winter), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so gratifying to see broader British audiences finally embrace African pop. Drake\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence and charisma ensures this will be another hit in that lineage, but J Hus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own sensitivity to what makes summer heat up would have carried it up the charts anyway."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/manchester-city-premier-league-dominance-champions-league", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Strength and power of Manchester City can reinforce Premier League dominance | Karen Carney", "lead": "Having the best managers in place helps to recruit the best players.

Football generally works in cycles, though, and the rest of the continent will be plotting to take over again. In the five finals before 2018, there was not an English side in sight and Spain was lording it over its rivals. Real Madrid won four out of five from 2013 in their dominant cycle, but they have been overtaken. Manchester City enter their second Champions League final in three years against Internazionale, who are the first Italian team since 2017 to reach this stage of a competition Serie A has dominated in the past. In the 10 seasons starting in 1988-89 an Italian club reached nine finals and won four. There are numerous reasons why the English game is enjoying a glorious spell. It is no coincidence the biggest clubs can attract the best managers. Pep Guardiola, J\u00c3\u00bcrgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel have taken English teams into the Champions League with knowledge gained elsewhere of how to beat the best in Europe. They arrived with experience of different leagues. Managers learn from one another, too. Mikel Arteta and Erik ten Hag worked with Guardiola at City and Bayern Munich respectively and they are pushing one another to be at their best. Guardiola keeps evolving, changing things tactically each season to maintain City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s challenge for trophies. Klopp brought his pressing style to Liverpool and has taken them to three Champions League finals. Those styles and philosophies have added to the English culture of technical play and fandom, aided by players wanting to be with those managers. Guardiola knows what worked for him in the past will not necessarily work now. At Barcelona, he, in essence, invented the false 9 for Lionel Messi; at Bayern he did the inverted full-back with Philipp Lahm; this season we have seen him create John Stones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hybrid role, which was carefully thought out and planned, and it has paid dividends in the biggest matches. Top managers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tactics only work if they have the right players and the Premier League can attract the best in the world. Almost every team in Europe would like Erling Haaland but City were able to snare him because they have a coach everyone wants to work with. If we look at the clamour to sign Ilkay G\u00c3\u00bcndogan it shows what incredible players City have. Players under Guardiola will be more desirable to bring in because of their skillset. The competitive nature of the Premier League is helping its clubs in Europe. City rarely had an easy weekend this season and had to fight for their points, regardless of who they were playing. There is strength throughout the league, which means the best teams have to push themselves. As an indication of how strong the Premier League is, Leicester won it seven years ago and were relegated this season. No other competition can boast this strength in depth. The need to maintain standards benefits a club such as City when they face quality opposition in the Champions League. What sets City apart, as Internazionale will know, is the physical advantage they have because of the high tempo required in the Premier League. I was at the FA Cup final, which was not City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best performance, and got to watch from behind Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dugout. It gave me a great perspective. I usually think in advance about what I am going to learn about the technical or tactical aspects but what really surprised me seeing City close up at Wembley was the sheer physicality of their team. The defence is really imposing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c John Stones is slighter than Manuel Akanji, R\u00c3\u00baben Dias and Kyle Walker, but he is still a big presence. Technically and tactically they are superb, but if they are drawn into one-v-one battles, they are physically dominant too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then there is Rodri, Kevin De Bruyne and Haaland. Not many teams will be able to compete with that on a physical level and then we have to add in how good City are technically and tactically. If anyone tries to bully City, they are going to fail. United really struggled in those physical one-v-one battles. It was something I had never noticed and it was interesting to see. If City have to mix it up and go long, getting Haaland to pin the ball to hold it up, they can do that too. They have every attribute required and character to go with it. They can win the duels, meaning they get the ball back quickly, and their work rate does not give opponents the chance to build a couple of passes or have any respite in possession. That is why sides have to counterattack against them or pick their moment wisely and City are well set up to deal with that. Bayern and Real Madrid learned to their cost about City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relentless pressing and clinical nature. They will take these lessons and look at how they can close the gap to instigate a new cycle of dominance for German or Spanish football. But the Premier League has the momentum and I cannot see that changing any time soon."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/08/tennis-french-open-carlos-alcaraz-novak-djokovic-preview", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Djokovic and Alcaraz ready to serve up French Open feast for the ages | Tumaini Carayol", "lead": "The unstoppable Spaniard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s red-hot form will test the immovable Serb, who has proved as wily as ever in his run to the semis", "author": "Tumaini Carayol at Roland Garros", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T19:00:39Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897049", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b2f0e58c7432e431051c612110b42a472d4eef86/0_64_8000_4800/500.jpg", "body": "Carlos Alcaraz arrived in Madrid last May still with plenty to prove. The swiftness with which he joined the elite had already become one of the defining stories of the season, but Alcaraz had still not faced the ultimate test, measuring up against Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic. By the end of the week, he had ticked both off the list. Alcaraz finished the Madrid Open by becoming the first player to beat Nadal and Djokovic consecutively on clay and he departed with the title. In the 13 months since, Alcaraz has risen higher still. He won his first grand slam at the US Open last year, the last one he played as he missed the Australian Open with injury. He became the ATP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first teenage world No 1. He has four Masters 1000 titles. At the same time Alcaraz established himself at the top, Djokovic re-established his own form having fallen from the No 1 ranking primarily because of his unvaccinated status freeing up his schedule. Djokovic has won the past two grand slam tournaments he entered and has seven titles since last May. Alcaraz and Djokovic have been the best in the world against the field they have faced, but during this same period they managed to avoid each other. In their only meeting, the Madrid Open semi\u00e2\u20ac\u2018final last year, Alcaraz edged Djokovic to win 6-7 (5), 7-5, 7-6 (5) after three hours and 36 minutes. This French Open marks the second time they have been in the same draw this year. On Friday they will meet in the semi-final of the French Open, a true inter-generational clash and one of the most anticipated matches in recent years. If form is the only factor, there would be little doubt about the favourite. Alcaraz has torn the field apart throughout the clay season, winning Barcelona and Madrid. In Paris, the top seed has raised the bar even higher. His destruction of Stefanos Tsitsipas, another top-four contender, on Tuesday night was stunning and further indication of how suffocating the combined force of his attacking and defensive capabilities are. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[He] brings a lot of intensity on the court. Reminds me of someone from his country that plays with a left hand,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Djokovic, smiling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He deserves his success, no doubt. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working hard and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very complete player already and only age 20.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Beyond tennis, one of the important qualities behind Alcaraz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success is how he seeks out the big moments rather than folding under pressure. After his quarter-final win, he made it abundantly clear he wanted to face Djokovic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the draw came out, everyone was expecting that match, the semi-final against Novak,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Myself as well. I really want to play that match. Since last year I really wanted to play again against Novak.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As he contests his 12th French Open semi-final, Djokovic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preparations were far less helpful. The third seed arrived here after toiling through one of his worst clay seasons, failing to reach a single semi-final and losing to players such as Dusan Lajovic and Lorenzo Musetti. He withdrew from Madrid because of his persistent elbow injury. While he has conceded only one set in Paris, Djokovic has been more satisfied with the improvements he has made than his level. He is 36 and although he still moves like a breath of wind, with every passing year maintaining his physicality and form becomes more challenging. Still, he has built a legendary career out of rising to the occasion and elevating his game when the moment, and the opponent, demands it. As he has grown older, the difference between beating him over best of three sets and outlasting him over five has become increasingly stark. Many more players can win two sets these days, but Djokovic prides himself on how hard it is to win three. For all of his strengths, Alcaraz can sometimes lose his way, making overzealous decisions and unforced errors. Although his serve has improved significantly this year, it can still be vulnerable, and he will now face one of the best returners in the world. Nobody is better suited to test Alcaraz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shot tolerance, decision-making and consistency to their limits. That such a meeting will take place on such an important occasion is fortunate but it also reflects their excellence. Just as it is unprecedented on the ATP for a 20-year-old to command a grand slam tournament as the top seed and favourite, it is rare for a 36-year-old to still be so great. They are two players at completely different points of their careers briefly passing each other by, but on Friday they will enter the fray as equals."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/08/football-jude-bellingham-real-madrid-england-dortmund", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Jude Bellingham is 19 years old but ready to be Real Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s everything | Sid Lowe", "lead": "The Englishman every club wanted to sign this summer can be the central piece in the construction of a new Real Madrid", "author": "Sid Lowe in Madrid", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T19:00:38Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897051", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/473fa09515f6436a7f9cbe664ef4d8d6d793d955/0_42_8140_4884/500.jpg", "body": "Jude Bellingham is a 4, an 8 and a 10 who wore 22 at Birmingham and Borussia Dortmund and could wear 11, 7 or 9 at Real Madrid.

Playing in his third country, 176 games into his career, he is an international with 24 caps who scored 24 goals and provided 25 assists in three years in Germany and won 482 duels last season, more than anyone else. He is also 19 years old and that may be the most significant number of all. Nineteen. A teenager has just become the second most expensive player in the history of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most successful club, a signing of huge symbolism and strategic significance. At the same time the news broke Lionel Messi was going to Miami because Barcelona do not have the money to bring him home, it was confirmed: for almost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140m total, their rivals had closed a deal with Dortmund. Liverpool had pulled out in April, Madrid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enduring power revealed. At a time when the discourse speaks of the dominance of state-owned clubs and England, a de facto super league, England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best prospect will not be in the Premier League and that matters. This matters more. Bellingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role and signing were planned and executed over a long time, not a response to results but a deeper analysis. Set to be presented at the Bernab\u00c3\u00a9u, where the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac800m renovation is nearing completion at last, and given the full gal\u00c3\u00a1ctico treatment, he has become the central piece in the construction of a new Madrid. Already under way, even if the timings cannot always be predicted with precision and finding a place for everyone is far from simple, that will be accelerated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I like the classics, rock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122n\u00e2\u20ac\u2122roll,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carlo Ancelotti said this time last year. His task now is to move towards something more modern, another age. Back then, Ancelotti referred to Casemiro, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the Bermuda triangle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When the ball goes in there, he said, it disappears. He talked admiringly about how they surprised him by doing things he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect, how he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even need to tell them anything. In fact, he joked, Madrid fans could rest assured: he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to get in the way. The Madrid midfield, they were eternal, except that no one is. Within a month, Casemiro had gone to Manchester United and although Madrid were European champions, there was no escaping the ages of Modric and Kroos, then 36 and 32 respectively. The beginnings of a shift had already been seen, if later than had been imagined, which is why Martin \u00c3\u02dcdegaard ended up departing. When Madrid turned it around against Manchester City in 2022, all three of the midfield had been taken off \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop Ancelotti turning to them on the touchline and consulting them on the substitutions. In the summer, he told them he would have to share the minutes around more and as 2022-23 progressed he referred to it as a transitional season, a gradual shift towards a new generation. The stats showed that. All their midfielders played more than 30 league games but Kroos started 25 of the 38, Modric 19. Ancelotti said he had to ask for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patience from the young players and understanding from the veterans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When it came to the biggest games, Modric and Kroos played \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153because they deserve to,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the coach insisted. And because, rotated, they were better able to. Aur\u00c3\u00a9lien Tchouam\u00c3\u00a9ni had come to replace Casemiro for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac80m, but his level slipped after the World Cup, often leaving Kroos as the deep midfielder. A place was found for Eduardo Camavinga at left-back. And the previous season Fede Valverde had been given a hybrid role on the right, although with Rodrygo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performances he returned to a midfield three. It was a solution of sorts, although it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look that way last month in Manchester in the Champions League semi-final and it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be sustained for ever. The question now is how to fit it all together as Madrid move to a new phase. Dani Ceballos is likely to leave, but Kroos has renewed for a season and Modric is expected to do the same. Camavinga isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a full-back, too good not to be in the middle of the pitch eventually. Tchouam\u00c3\u00a9ni is the long-term defensive midfielder. Ancelotti has reassured Valverde the arrival of Bellingham is not a threat; rather, this is the beginning of a new team charged with emulating the longevity of the men they are alongside. When the season starts Valverde will be 25, Tchouam\u00c3\u00a9ni 23, Camavinga 20 and Bellingham 20. There has been interest in Celta Vigo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Gabri Veiga, who is 21. Ahead of them, Vin\u00c3\u00adcius J\u00c3\u00banior and Rodrygo are 22. There is time for them, although that does not always mean patience, and that allows for lessons to be learned, adaptation periods to be completed. Performance will guide decisions in the short term and competition will remain, Modric and Kroos not about to simply let go. But the balance must be tipped towards the new generation. The club has told the coach that. Which also brings a more dynamic, more energetic approach, these players bursting through together \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not, they hope, any loss of quality. Kroos and Modric are not so easily emulated but Bellingham and Camavinga in particular should guarantee that. Put in the most simple terms: the Englishman is good at football. The Bundesliga\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s player of the season, there was a reason everyone wanted him. Lots of reasons: the touch, vision, passing, goals, tackles, the whole thing. Madrid got him, a place waiting for him, his for a decade or more. On the face of it, the make-up of the midfield is clear, although the departure of Karim Benzema a year ahead of schedule opens the possibility of some shift in the forward line that would affect the rest of the team. The most likely option appears to be 4-3-3 with Tchouam\u00c3\u00a9ni deep, Camavinga and Bellingham either side and Valverde as the extra man, probably wide; 4-2-3-1 is another. Bellingham has the qualities, and teammates, to fit any system Ancelotti comes up with, to be at the heart of everything. To be everything, just like they promised. When Bellingham was 13 or 14, Birmingham\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then head of development, Mike Dodds, told him not to limit himself to being a creative midfielder: instead, he said, you could be a 4, an 8 and a 10 wrapped in one. Add those numbers together and it makes 22, the number he wore there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the shirt they have proudly retired, so good was he \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then at Dortmund. If he is to continue that at Madrid, he would have to take it from Antonio R\u00c3\u00bcdiger. Wearing Zidane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 5 would mean taking it from Jes\u00c3\u00bas Vallejo. There may be no need: 7, 9, and 11 are serious numbers and are available. Whichever he chooses there is a conviction that it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t weigh on him as it has on so many others, that he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be overawed by this, the traditional concern about Brits abroad not worrying anyone: the Bundesliga shows that should be no problem. So does everything else, the way he has defied his date of birth. Madrid have watched him for a long time, dealt with him over a lengthy period too, and they have seen: the way a teenager appears to own the pitch, even the crowd, bringing a game and the stands to life. That is what they have invested in; the personality as well as the play, the ability to do it all and better than anyone else. Above all, they have invested in youth, in the future, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bright. Jude Bellingham is 19, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from Stourbridge and he has just signed for Real Madrid."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/pat-robertson-obituary", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Pat Robertson obituary", "lead": "US TV evangelist who sought the Republican presidential nomination and helped make religion central to the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics", "author": "Michael Carlson", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T18:58:49Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897056", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f182b0b7f152aa47efce3a4f990dc260cd8aa07e/0_49_2966_1779/500.jpg", "body": "Although the concept of separation of church and state is entrenched in the US constitution, the influence of churchmen in political affairs is an American tradition dating back to the colonial era. Indeed, modern media has made the voice of contemporary evangelists every bit as powerful as Cotton Mather\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sermons were to the early Puritans. Pat Robertson, who has died aged 93, rode the growth of cable television, and a shrewd sense of the economics of the business, to become the most overtly political, and arguably the most influential, of them all. When Robertson appeared on the front of Time magazine in 1986, the cover line read Gospel TV: Religion, Politics and Money. The melding of those three strands of his career was not always seamless, though in American fundamentalism, material wealth is usually seen as a visible sign of God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blessing. Through his Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), he progressed from televised faith healing to a serious run at the US presidency in 1988, and made a fortune in the process. Robertson started that campaign for the Republican nomination with a petition, and contributions, from 3 million viewers, and finished second in the Iowa caucuses, ahead of the then vice-president George HW Bush. But voters gave him little support in the Republican primaries, and Bush of course went on to the presidency. Robertson, who had handed control of CBN to his son Tim, then founded the Christian Coalition of America. Having failed to take over the Republican party, his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rainbow coalition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of fundamentalists would attempt to steer the party in its ideological direction. The coalition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lobbying exerted immense influence, helping spearhead the right\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assault on President Bill Clinton, and provided both a fundraising and ideological template for Bush. Although the coalition was censured and fined for coordinating its campaigns directly with the Republican party, and for improper aid delivered to then-House majority leader Newt Gingrich and the Virginia senatorial candidate Oliver North, its success spurred on Robertson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indulgence in another grand tradition of American evangelical preachers, the hubris that found him courting constant controversy, and frequent financial scandal. Controversy became inevitable with the shift from mainstream politics to the Christian Coalition. Preaching to the converted meant the restraints on expressing his true beliefs were lifted. The framework for those beliefs was set out in his 1991 bestseller The New World Order, an amalgam of historical conspiracy theories, which posited an alliance of Masons and Jewish bankers who controlled the world. Robertson called feminism a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practise witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He predicted that the staging of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gay days\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Disney World would result in God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retribution through earthquakes, tornados, terrorist bombings or meteors. Asked to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about rival Protestant denominations, such as Episcopalians, Presbyterians or Methodists, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be nice to the spirit of the antichrist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He described leftwing academics as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153racists, murderers, sexual deviants, and supporters of al-Qaida\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In 2005 he called for the assassination of the Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00c3\u00a1vez, and explained Ariel Sharon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2006 stroke as God\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s retribution for giving land back to Palestinians. He later apologised to Sharon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family and claimed to have been misquoted. That followed Robertson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standard pattern, of making wild accusations that pleased his core audience, then claiming to have been misquoted by an anti-Christian mainstream media. Most notoriously, on his TV show The 700 Club, he agreed emphatically with his fellow evangelist Jerry Falwell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s theory that the 9/11 attacks were caused by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pagans, abortionists, feminists, gays, lesbians, the American Civil Liberties Union, and [the progressive advocacy group] People for the American Way\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After the ensuing uproar, he claimed that due to a malfunctioning earpiece he had not actually heard what Falwell was saying when he agreed with it. Robertson came by his political ambitions naturally, being related through the family of his mother, Gladys (nee Willis), to two presidents, the Harrisons, William Henry and Benjamin, while his father, Willis Robertson, was a US Senator from Virginia, one of the conservative segregationist southern Democrats dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dixiecrats\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He was born in Lexington, Virginia, and christened Marion Robertson, but was nicknamed Pat, because his older brother, Willis Jr, would say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pat, pat, pat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while patting baby Marion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheeks. Pat was educated at two military academies: McDonogh, near Baltimore, and McCallie, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He attended Washington and Lee University in his home town. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Marines, but his claims to have seen combat with the First Marine Division in Korea came back to haunt him during his run for the presidential nomination. His Republican rival, Congressman Pete McCloskey, who had served with Robertson, said Robertson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father had used influence to keep him out of combat, and that his primary responsibility had been to keep the officers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clubs stocked with liquor. Robertson denounced this, and allegations by fellow Marines that he had consorted with prostitutes, as attempts to discredit him. Robertson returned home to gain a law degree in 1955 from Yale, but failed the bar exam. Soon afterwards, he was converted by the Dutch missionary Cornelius Vanderbreggen. By the time he was ordained by the Southern Baptist Convention in 1961, he had bought his first television station, in Portsmouth, Virginia, and established the Christian Broadcasting Network. He gave Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker their first break, doing a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s programme, and started the breakfast-time show The 700 Club, its title taken from a fundraising drive for 700 subscribers. Robertson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early success was based on televised faith healing. Critics pointed out that God seemed to speak through Robertson while taking programme cues from the director. His style, with fixed smile and narrow eyes, could seem almost a caricature of a snake-oil salesman, but its appeal was unquestionable, as CBN eventually claimed an audience in 180 countries. It functioned as a network of affiliated stations subscribing to its programming, but in 1977 Robertson started his own cable channel, CBN Cable, offering mainstream entertainment bookended by The 700 Club. Renamed the Family Channel, its profits eventually threatened CBN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s religious non-profit status, so Robertson set up International Family Entertainment, with himself and Tim as its heads, and sold the Family Channel to it. In 1992 he took IFE public, making $90m on the launch. In 1997, IFE sold the Family Channel to Rupert Murdoch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fox network for $1.9bn. Fox has since sold it on to Disney, but as a condition of the original sale, the channel, now called Freeform, is still required to broadcast The 700 Club, hosted by Pat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son Gordon, president of CBN, twice a day. Evangelists including Oral Roberts and Bob Jones had founded their own colleges, and Robertson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s television success spawned CBN University, now called Regent University, at the CBN headquarters in Virginia Beach, the city where Robertson lived in a hilltop mansion with its own landing strip. On a number of occasions he credited his public prayers for steering hurricanes away from Virginia Beach, though he was unsuccessful with Hurricane Isabel in 2003. More controversial than Regent was his international humanitarian charity Operation Blessing. In 1994, it was claimed in his local newspaper, the Virginian-Pilot, that Robertson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impassioned fundraising for Operation Blessing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s refugee airlift in Rwanda and Zaire was at least partly a cover for the use of his aircraft to transport diamond-mining equipment for the Robertson-owned African Development Corporation. A long investigation by Virginia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Office of Consumer Affairs recommended Robertson be prosecuted for fraud, but the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney general, Mark Earley, brought no charges against him. The George W Bush administration made Operation Blessing the second-largest recipient of federal relief funds in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina, which was seen in some quarters as payback for Robertson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support. In 2003, Robertson used The 700 Club as a platform to argue on behalf of the Liberian president Charles Taylor, who had been indicted by the UN for war crimes. It emerged that Robertson had an investment in a Liberian gold mine, which he claimed was intended to help pay for Operation Blessing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s humanitarian efforts in the country, but which was allowed to go bankrupt after Taylor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure from office. Other business enterprises included the Ice Capades, a pyramid sales scheme, and a financial services venture with the Bank of Scotland, which was cancelled after Robertson called Scotland \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a dark land overrun by homosexuals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. No matter how outrageous his statements, Robertson never alienated his core audience, and could count on the committed support of born-again Christians who felt the Lord spoke through him, and rewarded him for passing on his message, as did countless politicians hungry for his endorsement. He married Dede (Adelia) Elmer in 1954. She died in 2022 and Robertson is survived by their sons, Tim and Gordon, and daughters, Elizabeth and Ann, 14 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Pat (Marion Gordon) Robertson, evangelist, businessman, broadcaster and politician, born 22 March 1930; died 8 June 2023"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/british-child-among-french-alps-stabbing-victims-says-foreign-secretary-annecy", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "British child among French Alps stabbing victims, says foreign secretary", "lead": "Briton was one of four children aged between 22 months and three years attacked in Annecy playground", "author": "Alexandra Topping", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T18:54:29Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897058", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ad1cd519fbd0bad03e7158b37f4e980d293d4989/0_232_6963_4178/500.jpg", "body": "A British child is among four children and two adults who have been injured in the town of Annecy in the French Alps, after a knifeman went on a rampage in a playground, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign secretary has confirmed. At least two of the children, both aged about three, were reported to be in a critical condition in hospital, while an adult also suffered life-threatening injuries, French national police said. On Thursday afternoon the mayor of Annecy told French broadcaster BFM TV that the children who were injured were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of the operating room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after the morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack.

The UK foreign secretary, James Cleverly, who was speaking at an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) ministerial council press conference in France, called the attacks a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible act of violence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and said the British government was ready to support the French authorities in whatever way possible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are also aware that one of the people, one of the children injured, was a British national,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have already deployed British consular officials who are travelling to the area to make themselves available to support the family.

Speaking during a joint White House press conference with the US president, Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak told reporters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All our thoughts are with those who were affected \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I have been in touch with President Macron. We stand ready to offer any assistance that we can.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Witnesses described the suspected knifeman running around in a frenzy, apparently attacking at random, before he was stopped by police near the banks of Lake Annecy. The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the attack said the four children injured were aged between 22 months and three years, and that two adults were also injured. According to reports, the attack happened at about 9.45am local time (0845 BST), when a man armed with a knife entered a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playground close to the lake. Video footage showed him prowling the play area and attacking a group of small children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including one in a pushchair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as they played. A video showed a man being chased in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The former Liverpool footballer Anthony Le Tallec, who has also played for FC Annecy, witnessed part of the attack. He described seeing dozens of people running towards him and a mother shouting: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Run, someone is stabbing everyone, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stabbing children!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The prosecutor said the suspect was a 31-year-old Syrian man, who had been detained by police. His motives were as yet unknown, but the attack did not appear to be terrorism-related, said the prosecutor. The French prime minister, \u00c3\u2030lisabeth Borne, said the man had been granted refugee status in Sweden 10 years ago and was in France legally. She added that he had tried to apply for asylum in France, but was rejected as he already had asylum in Sweden. In his application, he said he was a Syrian Christian. Borne added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He has one child, who is the same age as the children he attacked.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She also confirmed he had no known criminal or psychiatric record. BFM TV reported the man had separated from his Swedish wife eight months ago, and that she said she had not heard from him for four months. The British home secretary, Suella Braverman, said she was in touch with her French counterpart, G\u00c3\u00a9rald Darmanin, adding that she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appalled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the attack. Braverman tweeted that her thoughts were with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the children, their families and the local community who have been affected by this shocking act\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/ukraine-villagers-flee-flooding-kakhovka-dam-attack", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThey hate us so much\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: villagers flee flooding after dam attack", "lead": "In Bilozerka, eight miles west of Kherson, people try to rescue animals and possessions but are forced to wait for waters to recede", "author": "Dan Sabbagh", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T18:36:48Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897061", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/415349e3b983be4dd5e86d4f8bee13b3cd5ea89a/0_546_8192_4918/500.jpg", "body": "It took 24 hours for the flood waters to come to Bilozerka, a frontline village 8 miles west of Kherson. When they did, in a 90-minute rush early on Wednesday, they flooded out about 24 cottages in two streets by the waterline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the fast rising levels forcing Oleksandr to flee his home of 22 years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was hiding in the attic, it was probably 4am, and I realised I had to swim back,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Oleksandr, looking out to his house from the new waterline. His dog, Zhanka, followed him into the water, only to drown from the effort of trying to reach safety. Oleksandr was waiting for an inflatable boat, paddled by aid workers, to take him back to the house where he hoped to see what he could rescue, or find his goat and other animals. A few minutes later, he returned empty handed, and cuddled another dog amid a bout of tears, forced to wait for the flood waters to recede. In a normal summer, Bilozerka, would be an attractive country location by a lake that links up to the Dnipro River, 45 miles downstream from the now ruined Kakhovka dam. But the flood water, bringing with it garbage and driftwood, has brought dirty ruin to parts of a village already at the centre of the 15-month war. An artillery duel goes on in the distance as aid workers from a US charity, Global Empowerment Mission, hand out food parcels and try to work out, with local officials, what help the village will need in the coming weeks. It is hard for visitors not to be distracted by the explosions, though in this case, they are perhaps 10 miles off. A nervousness hangs over the operation, which lasts a couple of hours. Two artillery rounds land just as the aid convoy arrives, white smoke rising up from nearby fields, prompting a security pause. It is decided it is safe to continue, but at another point, when too large a crowd has gathered to talk to aid workers and journalists, we are hurried on in case a missile were to strike. Russian artillery strikes, a regular occurrence in and around Kherson, had dropped off for a couple of days after the dam burst, giving Ukrainians hope the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gun line had been forced further away because of greater flooding on the far southern bank. But the bombing returned on Thursday, killing one and wounding two more, a few hours after Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited, when evacuations were being carried out in Kherson itself. Back in the village, Yulia Pavchuk, a teacher, and Natalia Dashkovska, her friend, have little good to say about Russians, believing them to have caused the dam burst earlier this week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was definitely not an accident, it was mined for a very long time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dashkovska begins. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With Russians there are definitely not any accidents. They hate us so much, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t perceive us as a country, a nation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pavchuk continues, describing the war and the flooding as a genocide. Electricity to the flooded part of the village has been cut off. Water supply to the taps has been cut off too, preventing washing and cleaning. Drinking water already had to be delivered by trucks, but now the demand will only increase, say the two women, and they expect a protracted clean-up and gradual reconstruction when Ukraine can ill afford it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I discussed this with my husband \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if the dam burst, all the houses in the low-lying part of the village would be fucked,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dashkovska adds, emphatically. Yet, if this sounds serious, the women still believe the situation on the Russian-occupied side of the Dnipro is far worse. Dashkovska says she has heard that in Oleshky, across from Kherson, Russian soldiers have been preventing evacuations, and have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seized the top floor of an apartment block\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for themselves. Nobody is dead or missing or needs rescuing from a roof top or elsewhere in Bilozerka, and the urgent phase of the crisis is over, while the residents say the waters have peaked. A local official, who declines to be interviewed, can be overheard on the phone suggesting other areas might need immediate help more. But Michael Capponi, the chief executive of Global Empowerment Mission, said the real problem for Bilozerka and the dozens of riverside villages like it, was the long process of recovery. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As soon as the water seeps, there is going to be so much interior damage,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every single home is going to need bedding, mattresses. Some of the furniture will be saved, but appliances will be ruined. It looks like there could be no running water for a long time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/kakhovka-dam-collapse-unlikely-to-hurt-ukraine-counteroffensive-but-will-have-long-term-impact", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Kakhovka dam collapse unlikely to hurt Ukraine counteroffensive but will have long-term impact", "lead": "Catastrophe is also likely to fuel concerns about Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brinkmanship, if suspicions that Russia blew up the dam are proved", "author": "Emma Graham-Harrison", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T18:28:36Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897064", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6e1cda31415e74f97b77f65dd86e15c63fa2f3b7/0_275_8192_4914/500.jpg", "body": "The collapse of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kakhovka dam is not likely to significantly hinder the first stages of the counteroffensive against Russian troops, now gathering force across the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s south and east. A river crossing in Kherson province, downstream from the dam, would have been technically challenging and extremely risky even before the area became a vast flood plain. Ukrainian strikes are expected in places where the frontline lies mostly on firm ground. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Kakhovka dam is at least 100 miles from where much of the activity might take place, at its closest point,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Michael Kofman, director of the Russia studies programme at the CNA thinktank said on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A Ukrainian cross-river operation in southern Kherson, below the dam, was always a risky and therefore low-probability prospect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, the humanitarian crisis unleashed by flooding may \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impact on Ukrainian momentum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, by absorbing time and resources of senior leadership, said ProfTracey German, a specialist in Russian foreign and security policy at King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s College London. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It could well disrupt plans, not least because it draws the attention of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership to dealing with the consequences of the disaster \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Zelensky travelling to Kherson today as an example \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rather than focusing solely on the counteroffensive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although I am sure Kyiv had considered the possibility of the dam being destroyed, [as] Russia had threatened it in the autumn of 2022, the reality is likely to be a distraction.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ukrainian officials claimed that Russia destroyed the dam \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of fear that Ukrainian forces would land on the east (left) bank Kherson oblast,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Institute for the Study of War said in a report. The flood waters did sweep away Ukrainian outposts that had been set up on the eastern bank of the Dnipro, after weeks of probing Russian defences. But they were small, and in the medium term, there may be some military advantages for Ukraine from the catastrophe. The flood also destroyed sections of an initial line of defence fortifications that Russian troops had been reinforcing for months, forcing some to retreat from some posts, and probably abandon equipment, the ISW said. Until the dam is rebuilt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which will not be until after the war \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this area will revert to swampy wetlands surrounded by a flood plain. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partisans, and its more nimble military, are likely to have an advantage in that kind of terrain. And although the city of Kherson is still being shelled, including in places where evacuations were being organised on Thursday, the flood waters have forced the retreat of some artillery units that had been attacking the city. That has put at least some areas under Ukrainian control out of range, and made others harder to target. Longer term though, the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destruction will be devastating for Ukraine. It provided water to irrigate swathes of some of the richest farming land on the planet, and its power plant was a vital source of electricity, particular after more than a year of attacks on Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grid. The catastrophe is also likely to fuel concerns about Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brinkmanship, if strong suspicions that Russia blew up the dam are proved, or are not countered. Blowing up the dam is one of the most reckless things Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces could do, short of using a nuclear weapon. A willingness to recklessly endanger civilian lives, sweep away Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own forces and damage farming systems vital to global security \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for whatever reason \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may add to western concerns that a cornered Russia could go even further in future."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/08/40-security-guards-ucl-could-lose-jobs-restructuring", "primaryCategory": "education", "title": "Up to 40 security guards at UCL could lose jobs under restructuring", "lead": "Contractor says many of its staff rely on working 60 hours a week, but could see this reduced to 42 on average", "author": "Kevin Rawlinson", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T18:12:57Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897068", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/25283b54d7e1536762878474ad87bda983a0e51c/0_42_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "Dozens of security guards at one of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prestigious universities face losing their jobs, while many more are likely to see pay cuts of as much as \u00c2\u00a313,500 a year during the cost of living crisis, their representatives have said. In the latest episode in the long-running fight by outsourced workers at University College London (UCL), the staff have been told that, with the risk of redundancy hanging over them, the roughly 260 existing workers would be expected to compete for around 220 remaining jobs, or leave. The contractor that handles UCL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s security staffing, Bidvest Noonan, said those who were handed one of the roles were likely to be offered substantially reduced hours and, therefore, pay. Those who were unsuccessful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c expected to number about 40 people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would be made redundant if they could not be redeployed elsewhere within the firm. The Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) union said many would see huge pay cuts, while changes to the way the roles are carried out could also make the jobs impractical. According to a Bidvest Noonan presentation seen by the Guardian, the contractor said many of its security staff at UCL relied on working more than 60 hours a week. It said it planned to cut this to a 42-hour-week on average. The IWGB said that would represent losses of up to \u00c2\u00a313,500 a year for some staff. A spokesperson added that the plan to impose a four-days-on, four-days-off shift pattern and scrap desk jobs meant that the roles would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more physically demanding and will also have a detrimental impact on campus safety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On Thursday, Ian Dancy, executive director of operations at UCL, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our security colleagues are highly valued and respected members of the UCL community, and we rely on their expertise to ensure our campus is safe and secure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last year, security guards at UCL went on strike for better pay and union recognition, while their representatives accused bosses of trying to intimidate them by bringing in lower-paid agency workers to cover gaps left by the industrial action. The University and College Union condemned UCL for what it characterised as strike-breaking. It said the act appeared to be an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attempt to victimise workers exercising their lawful rights to join a union and engage in industrial action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The IWGB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general secretary, Henry Chango Lopez, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UCL should be ashamed of their treatment of vital outsourced staff. To toss aside so many hardworking people, treating them like numbers on a spreadsheet rather than human beings, goes against all the values UCL claims to stand for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dancy added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To ensure security teams are more visible and agile across UCL\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s large Bloomsbury campus, our providers, Bidvest Noonan, are consulting with their staff on a number of changes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our security colleagues are highly valued and respected members of the UCL community, and we are committed to working closely with them and with Bidvest Noonan throughout this period of change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bidvest Noonan will be doing everything they can to support colleagues through the consultation process and to mitigate any compulsory redundancies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This includes making existing and newly created redeployment opportunities available to ensure security staff can be retained within Bidvest Noonan, and the option of an enhanced voluntary resignation scheme.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bidvest Noonan has not responded to a request for comment."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/russian-forces-accused-of-blocking-flood-evacuation-efforts", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Russian forces accused of blocking flood evacuation efforts in Ukraine", "lead": "Reports say Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces preventing volunteers from rescuing people in town badly affected after collapse of Nova Kakhovka dam", "author": "Pjotr Sauer", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T18:08:52Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897070", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1a9e088d31e541228219aa4a5dc9d6b5bd628c7e/0_95_4000_2401/500.jpg", "body": "Russian forces in control of a Ukrainian town on the occupied southern side of the Dnipro River near Kherson have been accused of preventing evacuation efforts after flooding caused by the Nova Kakhovka dam bursting. The town of Oleshky appears to be the worst-affected area in territory controlled by Russia. Videos and photographs from the scene have depicted severe flooding and residents stranded on the roofs of their cottages. Reports have emerged indicating that Russian forces were preventing local volunteers from evacuating people in Oleshky by setting up checkpoints around the town. Helping to Leave, an organisation that provides aid and services to Ukrainians fleeing the war, said it had been unable to organise evacuations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are not allowing volunteers on boats to enter,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a representative from the group told the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[Russian] emergency services are carrying out some evacuation but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very selective and it is not enough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At least five people have died in Russian-occupied parts of southern Ukraine since the dam burst. Russian emergency services on Thursday said that evacuations were under way, but some residents and human rights groups criticised Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Russian emergency services are evacuating a small percentage of people but, judging from the volume of evacuation requests we are receiving, absolutely not as many as they should,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Helping to Leave representative said. The representative said their organisation had received more than 350 evacuation requests from people stuck on the Russian-controlled southern bank of the river. One such request, the organisation said, came at midnight from three pensioners who were floating around the town on inflatable mattresses. Sergei, a local volunteer, said the situation in Oleshky was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bad\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is almost no contact with the people there. No one is allowed into the town and those who make it out on boats are placed into buses and driven away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We tried reaching Oleshky but checkpoints have been set up all around the town. A lot of people are waiting to be evacuated. We have heard stories of people drowning, but we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t confirm because there is no access.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There appeared to be no phone signal in Oleshky on Thursday, leaving many relatives to frantically search online for information about their loved ones. Svetlana, an Oleshky native who moved to Kherson after the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s liberation last autumn, told the Guardian her mother and aunt remained in the town. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My mother told me yesterday that they would go on the roof until someone rescues them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The local authorities didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t instruct them what to do. I am calling the Russian emergency services all the time but they aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helping \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Russia has just forgotten about them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Local Telegram channels were also full of desperate messages from relatives, asking for their loved ones to be rescued. One message read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SOS!!! Can anyone with a boat help? Cottagers Anna .. and her husband have been sitting on their roof since morning, praying for rescue. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve raised a white flag. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first house on the right. Help!!!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Another said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Help! How can people in Oleshky be saved? Everyone in the Red Army district is sitting on the roof, waiting for assistance. Animals are sinking, drowning.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Kazkova Dibrova zoo on the Russian-held riverbank was completely flooded and all 300 animals were dead, a representative said via the zoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Facebook account. There appeared to be isolated reports of Ukrainian volunteers on boats performing daring rescue operations in Russian-occupied land to rescue stranded locals. In one video on social media, a mother and her young son are seen being evacuated by boat and brought across the Dnipro to Kyiv-controlled territory. The mother and son are then seen thanking the Ukrainian volunteers. In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear and rapid reaction from the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross, who he said were not helping the relief effort. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, similarly called on international humanitarian organisations to provide assistance on the occupied southern bank. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We appeal to you to take charge of evacuating people from the territory of Kherson oblast occupied by Russia. We must save the lives of people whom the occupiers have condemned to death,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shmyhal said. On Thursday, Zelenskiy visited the flood-stricken section of Kherson. The Ukrainian president said more than 2,000 people had been rescued from the flooding."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/dam-collapse-global-problem-waters-may-poison-black-sea-zelenskiy", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Dam collapse a global problem as waters may poison Black Sea, Zelenskiy says", "lead": "Ukrainian president warns flood waters contaminated with sewage, oil, chemicals and possibly anthrax", "author": "Julian Borger in Kyiv", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T18:04:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897073", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b8fcae9f155fd00d7a1a882ca8f1061dbba38e95/481_560_4597_2758/500.jpg", "body": "Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the ecological disaster triggered by the collapse of the Nova Kakhovka dam has become a global problem as severely contaminated waters flow into the Black Sea.

As well as the 100,000 people affected downstream, Zelinskiy said 50,000 hectares (125,000 acres) of forests had been flooded, and 20,000 animals and 10,000 birds were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153under threat of imminent death\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Altogether 2 million living beings are in danger,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy said, warning that as the contaminated water spreads, so would the environmental devastation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The poisoning and contamination coming from the flooding area goes to the groundwater almost immediately, poisoning rivers and then the water basin of the Black Sea,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not happening somewhere else. It is all interrelated in the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy was speaking amid growing concerns over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, about 125 miles (200km) upstream from the dam. The plant has drawn on the Kakhova reservoir to cool its reactor cores and spent fuel, but the reservoir is now rapidly draining into the lower Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said there is no immediate risk to the plant because it has water reserves, particularly a large cooling pond. However, a report by the French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) has said that earlier studies suggested the dyke around the cooling pond could collapse under the pressure of the water in it if the depth of the reservoir on the other side of the dyke dipped below 10 metres. It is currently below 13 metres and falling. Karine Herviou, the IRSN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cooling needs were limited and in an emergency could be met by other means. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Herviou said. However, nuclear experts warned the safety of the plant would then be extremely fragile. Petro Kotin, the head of Energoatom, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear energy corporation, said the destruction of the dam meant the occupied Zaporizhzhia plant could also be under threat of Russian sabotage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both the interior and the access roads to it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The relief effort on the Ukrainian-held right bank of the Dnipro continued on Thursday, as the official death toll rose to six. One person was killed and two injured as displaced people and relief workers came under artillery fire from the Russian side of the river. On Wednesday, Zelenskiy had criticised the UN and the Red Cross for failing to support the flood relief effort. On Thursday evening, he thanked international organisations for their help on the right bank but said they still had no presence in the Russian-occupied area where people were still trapped. As Ukraine struggled to contain the damage of the dam collapse on Thursday, fighting was intensifying along the frontline with Russian occupation forces. In particular, a substantial Ukrainian force, reportedly including western tanks and other equipment, appeared to be making a concerted push south of the city of Zaporizhzhia towards a Russian logistics hub in the town of Tokmak. The US press quoted unnamed US and Ukrainian officials as saying that Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-awaited counteroffensive had begun, but a spokesperson for the Ukrainian general staff said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have no such information.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hydro power corporation Ukrhydroenergo, which oversees the Kakhova dam, said the left bank would have to be liberated before reconstruction work could begin, but plans were already being drawn up in anticipation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Water is continually flowing over it and destroying the foundation. Only when the water has calmed will we be able to see the extent of the destruction,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Syrota told the Guardian. He thought that would take 10 days. He said the next step would be to build a 15 metre-high buffer dam upstream of the ruined hydroelectric station so that work could start on building a new one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will take us four months to make the [buffer dam],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we can start the work only after the liberation of this territory.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a later interview with Ukrainian media, Syrota, said the construction time for the new buffer dam could be halved to two months \u00e2\u20ac\u0153provided that we work 24/7\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Syrota dismissed suggestions that the dam could have been destroyed as result of partial damage that led to catastrophic structural failure, calling them Russian propaganda. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The plant was designed to withstand a nuclear strike,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Syrota said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To destroy the plant from the outside, at least three aircraft bombs, each of 500kg, would have had to be dropped on the same spot. The station was blown up from the inside.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In October 2022, the Russians kicked all the workers out of the station, and from then the facility produced no energy. It became just a fortification for the Russian military. They brought hundreds of kilograms of explosives there. Ukraine reported last year that the station was mined. The Russians were just waiting for right day to blow it up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/tense-fighting-reported-as-ukrainian-forces-go-on-attack-south-of-zaporizhzhia", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Intense fighting reported as Ukrainian forces go on attack south of Zaporizhzhia", "lead": "Counteroffensive reported to have begun, with large force pushing assault against Russian positions", "author": "Peter Beaumont", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T18:03:55Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897078", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6ec5f1ae4d9733bcad529ea4695eab220d204dbe/0_32_4223_2534/500.jpg", "body": "A substantial Ukrainian force was pushing an assault against Russian positions in the south on Thursday, in an intensification of fighting that some Ukrainian officials and western analysts said marked the start in earnest of Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s much-vaunted counteroffensive. The combat against Russian positions south of Zaporizhzhia included western-supplied tanks and armoured vehicles and infantry backed by artillery. There were reports of intense fighting outside the town of Tokmak, a key Russian logistical hub. Asked about US media reports that the counteroffensive had begun, a spokesperson for Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general staff said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have no such information. And we do not comment on anonymous sources.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ukrainian officials, however, have insisted that they would not make an official announcement when the counteroffensive begins and have cautioned against focusing on a single area, suggesting it could involve a number of components. The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based thinktank that has been producing daily updates on the war, said it had concluded on Thursday that the Ukrainian counteroffensive had begun. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Activity throughout Ukraine is consistent with a variety of indicators that Ukrainian counteroffensive operations are under way across the theater,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the group tweeted. On Thursday evening president Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed what he described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153results\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in heavy fighting in the Donetsk region. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is very heavy fighting in Donetsk region,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there are results and I am grateful to those who achieved these results. Well done in Bakhmut. Step by step.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Zelenskiy referred to other areas where fighting is going on, but said he would provide no details. Following days of heavy shelling of Russian defences, Ukrainian units were reported to have stepped up efforts to break thorough in the Orihiv-Tokmak sector, which blocks the route to the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a key objective for Kyiv. Unconfirmed reports suggested that German-made Leopard tanks and US Bradleys had been thrown into the battle along with scores of other armoured vehicles. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said Ukrainian forces from Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 47th mechanised brigade, with up to 1,500 troops and 150 armoured vehicles, made \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an attempt to break through\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but Russian forces dealt the attack \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a preventive blow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, although Russian military bloggers painted a far more nuanced picture. Images posted by the Russian military blogger Rybar purported to show Ukrainian armour immobilised during the assault although neither those claims nor those of Shoigu could be verified. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian occupation official in the area, also told the RIA Novosti news agency that Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces were exerting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153maximum force\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd against Russian positions in the Zaporizhzhia region. Russia has long anticipated a Ukrainian offensive in this direction, building multi-tiered defences around this area of the frontline including zig-zag trenches, dragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teeth and other obstacles. Claims that Kyiv is escalating efforts in the Zaporizhzhia area followed days of heavy shelling, with fires visible on Nasa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Firms satellite monitoring system. Appearing to confirm that a major assault was under way, the Ukrainian deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russia was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153actively on the defensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Orihiv area of Zaporizhzhia region. Speaking to ABC news, two Ukrainian officials, including a source close to president Zelenskiy, seemed also to confirm an active phase of the Ukrainian counteroffensive. While firm details of the fighting remained shaky, Ukrainian efforts appeared to be concentrated on the village of Robotnye, the Orihiv-Tokmak highway and outside Orihiv itself. On Telegram, the Russian military blogger channel War Gonzo discounted early claims by some that the Ukrainian effort was becoming \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bogged down\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd saying it remained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early to say\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and describing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard night\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Russian forces around Orihiv. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is reported from the scene that in the direction of Orihiv-Tokmak the enemy infantry continues to approach and try to gain a foothold. Enemy artillery and tanks are still intensively working on our positions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our troops hold the line and do not allow a breakthrough of the front, destroying enemy manpower and equipment. According to information from the field, our fighters managed to knock out a tank similar to the Leopard, but it is still impossible to identify the destroyed equipment for certain.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Other Russian sources spoke of an assault with armour and infantry on Robotyne with both Ukrainian and Russian aviation active and strikes reported on Tokmak itself on Thursday. One account posted on Twitter, purportedly by a Ukrainian soldier, described troops struggling to clear pathways through minefields around Malaya Tokmak. The fighting near Zaporizhzhia will be intensely scrutinised as this area of the front has long been seen as a potential axis for a Ukrainian assault towards Melitopol, not least because Tokmak itself is a major railway junction and Russian logistical hub that has key lines of communication with Mauripol, Berdyansk and Crimea. Another objective of a Ukrainian assault south and east from this direction has long been supposed to sever the Russian \u00e2\u20ac\u0153land bridge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd linking areas of the occupied south and east with Crimea. On 3 June, Zelensiky announced that the armed forces of Ukraine were ready for the long-awaited counteroffensive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how long it will take,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told the Wall Street Journal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To be honest, it can go a variety of ways, completely different. But we are going to do it, and we are ready.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Commenting on whether the destruction of the Kakhovka dam earlier this week might hinder Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts, US analyst Michael Kofman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the Ukrainian plan is to break through [Russian] lines in Zaporizhzhia and advance to the ground lines of communication from Crimea, or sever the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcland bridge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the resultant flooding is unlikely to impede such an operation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ben Barry, senior fellow for land warfare at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, was among those suggesting the counteroffensive had now begun. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since 4 June Ukrainian forces have been attacking along the front line.

Schools and public events were canceled throughout the city, as city officials encouraged residents to remain indoors, limit outdoor activity and wear masks when outside. But Solis said he and his colleagues could not afford to take a day off. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The problem is that because we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a minimum wage, and we still have to rely on tips,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Ligia Guallpa, executive director of the Workers Justice Project, noted that app delivery workers, because they are classified as independent contractors, are excluded from minimum wage and worker protections and paid sick time leave. Workers have been pushing for local legislation to mandate these protections. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This situation is a great example of why New York City needs to implement the minimum pay law that has been delayed because of corporations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 advocacy against having to pay a minimum wage for 65,000 deliveristas,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Guallpa. The dangerous pollution levels have reminded some of the Covid pandemic, which struck New York and its essential workers particularly hard. After the pandemic, there were renewed calls for more protections for essential workers. In March 2023, New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mayor, Eric Adams, rolled back a $23.82 an hour minimum wage for delivery workers that was set to be enacted by 2025 to $19.96 per hour. The city has also delayed rolling out minimum pay scales that were scheduled to go into effect six months ago as delivery app companies, worker groups and elected officials battle over how and how much workers will be paid.

Researchers found that levels of the micronutrient taurine fell substantially with age, but that topping them up to more youthful levels boosted the health of mice and monkeys and even extended the lifespans of mice. It is unclear whether humans might benefit in the same way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or whether the required high doses are even safe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but scientists believe the evidence is strong enough to warrant a large-scale trial, particularly given that taurine occurs naturally in the body and is already used as a supplement at lower doses. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taurine abundance declines with age and reversal of this decline makes animals live longer and healthier lives,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dr Vijay Yadav, who led the research at Columbia University in New York. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the end of the day, these findings should be relevant to humans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prof Henning Wackerhage, a molecular exercise physiologist on the team at the Technical University of Munich, said a trial would compare how humans fared after taking daily taurine or placebo supplements. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will probably be very difficult to look at whether they live longer, but at least we can check if they live healthier for longer, and that of course is the goal for medicine.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yadav\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team homed in on taurine as a potential driver of the ageing process in 2012 when an analysis of blood compounds found that levels of the amino acid dropped dramatically with age in mice, monkeys and humans. By the age of 60, taurine levels in a typical person slumped to one-third of that seen in five-year-olds, they found. The discovery prompted the team to test the impact of extra taurine on middle-aged mice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whatever we checked, taurine-supplemented mice were healthier and appeared younger than the control mice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yadav said, noting they had denser bones, stronger muscles, better memory and younger looking immune systems. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Taurine made animals live healthier and longer lives by affecting all the major hallmarks of ageing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Beyond improving health, mice on taurine lived longer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on average an extra 10% for males and 12% for females, amounting to an additional three to four months, the equivalent of seven or eight human years. A comparable dose for humans would be three to six grams a day. The scientists next looked at whether boosting taurine benefited animals that were much closer biologically to humans. A six-month trial in middle-aged macaques found that a daily taurine pill appeared to boost health by preventing weight gain, lowering blood glucose and improving bone density and the immune system. Other evidence suggests taurine supplementation may have some effect in humans. Yadav and his team analysed medical data from 12,000 Europeans aged 60 and over. Those with higher taurine levels had less obesity, type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, and lower levels of inflammation. Strenuous sessions on an exercise bike were found to boost taurine levels, the researchers report in Science. Without a major trial to demonstrate the safety or any benefits of taurine supplements, the scientists are not recommending people boost their intake through pills, energy drinks or dietary changes. Taurine is made naturally in the body and is found in meat and shellfish diets, but the healthiest diets are largely plant-based. Some energy drinks contain taurine, but the scientists warn they also contain other substances that may not be safe to consume at high levels. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we really need now is a human intervention study,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wackerhage said, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are raring to go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an accompanying article, Joseph McGaunn and Joseph Baur at the University of Pennsylvania agree. Taurine supplementation in baby formula and energy drinks has thrown up few safety concerns, but they add that potential risks should still be considered given the lack of long-term human trials. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like any intervention, taurine supplementation with the aim of improving human health and longevity should be approached with caution.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/08/jack-daniels-dog-toy-supreme-court-us", "primaryCategory": "law", "title": "Whiskey-a-no-no: dog toy cannot mimic Jack Daniel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, US supreme court rules", "lead": "Justices unanimously reject lower court ruling that defined Bad Spaniel chew toy as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcexpressive work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 exempt from trademark law", "author": "Guardian staff and agency", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T17:56:19Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897086", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5a36452c905a7cd470c318a696df456ddf538479/0_297_3971_2384/500.jpg", "body": "The US supreme court on Thursday gave a boost to Jack Daniel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in its trademark dispute with a dog accessory company that sold a parody chew toy resembling the distiller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s widely recognized black-label whiskey bottle. The 9-0 decision written by Justice Elena Kagan, from the liberal wing of the bench, threw out a lower court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling that the pun-laden Bad Spaniels vinyl chew toy sold by an Arizona company called VIP Products is an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expressive work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd protected by the US constitution\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first amendment.

Lower courts had ruled in favor of VIP Products after applying what is called the Rogers test, which has allowed artists to lawfully use another\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trademark when doing so has artistic relevance to their work and would not explicitly mislead consumers about its source. The test was crafted in a 1989 decision by the New York-based second US circuit court of appeals in a case brought by the Hollywood legend Ginger Rogers. The actor unsuccessfully sued to block the 1986 film Ginger and Fred from director Federico Fellini that referred to her famed dance partnership with Fred Astaire. A lawyer for the Biden administration had urged the justices to discard the Rogers test in favor of the more-rigorous multi-factor test normally used in trademark-infringement cases, which looks squarely at whether the acts would be likely to cause marketplace confusion. An appeals court ruled in 2020 in favor of VIP Products on two grounds. The ninth circuit found the Bad Spaniels toy was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153expressive work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shielded by the first amendment. It also ruled that VIP Product\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of the Jack Daniel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trademark was non-commercial because it was used not only to sell dog toys but also \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to convey a humorous message\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and thus had not tarnished the distiller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s distinctive mark."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/08/russia-ukraine-war-live-first-kherson-dam-flooding-deaths-un-nuclear-watchdog-to-strengthen-presence-at-zaporizhzhia-plant", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war: Russian troops accused of shelling civilians during flood evacuations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "Kyiv says evacuation attempts the subject of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctargeted strikes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in Kherson region", "author": "Mabel Banfield-Nwachi (now); Caroline Davies, Martin Belam and Helen Sullivan (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T17:55:12Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897089", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7e10daaf630bbd4efa3aa7ec3e146b43be6d3989/0_549_8192_4915/500.jpg", "body": "It is now approaching 9pm in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.

A group of leading Russian independent media organisations together with Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have called on big tech companies to establish a working group to prevent Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online information shutdown, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pjotr Sauer reports. The past few days have brought a very marked intensification of fighting south of Zaporizhzhia in the direction of the key town of Tokmak. While the situation remains highly confused, some Russian military bloggers have been speculating that this might be the beginning of the long anticipated Ukrainian summer offensive, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Peter Beaumont reports. The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julian Borger reports. The World Health Organization has rushed emergency supplies to flood-hit parts of Ukraine and are preparing to respond to an array of health risks including trauma, drowning and waterborne diseases such as cholera, officials said on Thursday. Ukraine could lose several million tons of crops because of flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Thursday. Drone footage shows the extent of flooding after the Ukraine dam collapse. Russian shelling killed a civilian in the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prosecutor general claimed. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said that Russia is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153actively on the defensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Orikhiv area of Zaporizhzhia region, a possible confirmation that Ukraine is attacking in that direction. The investigations team of the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has released a new video in which it claims to have found a son of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, whose name was previously not known to the public. Over the past year, Shoigu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged son has been making cheesy pop songs in English while his father is sending tens of thousands of Russians to war in Ukraine, the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Shaun Walker reported. Sergei Shoigu said on Thursday that his forces had repelled overnight attempts by Ukrainian forces to break through the frontline in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RIA news agency reported. At least three people were wounded in Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka dam, police said. The Russian embassy has said the responsibility for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfolding tragedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Kherson due to the destruction of the Kakhovka dam lies with Kyiv and western countries who have supplied Ukraine with weapons, in what they describe as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrorist plot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a statement. Britain announced a new sanctions package against Belarus on Thursday for its role in facilitating Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine, including import bans and new measures aimed at preventing internet propaganda. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said on Thursday that Ukraine had shelled an evacuation point for civilians affected by the Kakhovka dam breach in the town of Hola Prystan, killing two people, Reuters reports. The Kremlin on Thursday accused Ukraine of shelling Russian rescue workers in the area flooded after the huge Kakhovka dam in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kherson region was breached earlier this week. It did not provide any immediate evidence for its assertion. In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear and rapid reaction from the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross, who he said were not helping the relief effort. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning.

Russia on Thursday denied Ukrainian accusations that it backed pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and discriminates against ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea, accusing Kyiv instead of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blatant lies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top court. Ukraine has asked The Hague-based International Court of Justice (ICJ) to order Russia to halt alleged discrimination against the Tatar ethnic group in Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula occupied by Russia since 2014. At the second day of hearings at the ICJ, the Russian ambassador to the Netherlands, Alexander Shulgin, said: Ukraine is constantly turning to blatant lies and false accusations leveled against the Russian federation. In the same case, Kyiv also says that Moscow violated a UN anti-terrorism treaty by equipping and funding pro-Russian forces, including militias who shot down Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 298 passengers and crew in 2014. On the first day of the hearing, Ukraine accused Russia of being a terrorist state and said it tried to erase the culture of ethnic Tatars and Ukrainians in Crimea. Russia denies systematic human rights abuses in Ukrainian territory that it occupies. The court adjourned on Thursday but will hold two more days of hearings next week where Ukraine and Russia can react to each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s submissions. The International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, is expected to rule on the case before the end of this year. Here is a round-up of images from the wires of Ukrainian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recusing animals from flooding in the Kherson region after the Nova Kakhovka dam was breached. One of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest-serving and most respected human rights campaigners went on trial on Thursday, facing the prospect of three years in jail if convicted of repeatedly discrediting Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armed forces, his organisation said. Oleg Orlov has since 1999 been one of the leaders of Memorial, which won a share of the Nobel Peace prize in 2022 a year after being banned and dissolved in Russia. Since sending its tanks into Ukraine in February 2022, Moscow has intensified a long-running clampdown on all forms of political dissent and made it an offence to discredit the armed forces or deviate from government accounts of what it calls a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special military operation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Reuters reports. Orlov, who came to prominence by opposing Soviet totalitarianism, told the independent Moscow Times last month that campaigners like him were to some extent following the path of anti-communist dissidents of the cold war era. The charges are based on an article he wrote denouncing Russia for waging the conflict. He told the court, according to a Memorial post on Telegram: In my article I spoke about the terrible role that war plays for the development of the political regime in our country. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an opinion, reasoning, an evaluation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, adding that he could not understand how he could be punished for expressing an opinion. Orlov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence team included Dmitry Muratov, editor of the now-banned independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta and also a winner of the Nobel Peace prize, for his decades of work to defend freedom of speech in Russia. Outside the court, Muratov told reporters: Article 29 of the constitution directly says that censorship is prohibited, everyone has the right to disseminate information, and no one has the right to force anyone to give up their beliefs. Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia director, said the state could not tolerate Orlov\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153need to defend the truth and his refusal to remain silent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The price he and others pay for exercising their right to freedom of expression in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Russia is very high indeed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. A senior Russian commander briefed President Vladimir Putin today on how his forces had repelled a large-scale Ukrainian attack in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, the Tass news agency reported. Defence minister Sergei Shoigu said earlier on Thursday that Russian forces had withstood fierce overnight attempts by Ukrainian troops to break through the frontline in Zaporizhzhia and had inflicted heavy losses on them, according to Reuters. The Russian defence ministry on Thursday evening released a video clip of an interview in which a commander called Col Gen Alexander Romanchuk was seen explaining how Russian forces had held off the Ukrainian forces in Zaporizhzhia. A group of leading Russian independent media organisations together with Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have called on big tech companies to establish a working group to prevent Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s online information shutdown. Since the start of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has blocked or closed down nearly all independent media outlets. The Kremlin has also blocked major western social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. In part, the letter said: The Russian authorities are preparing for Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s re-election in 2024. No other discourse than official propaganda will be tolerated. We have strong suspicions that YouTube and Telegram could be totally blocked in Russia no later than this autumn. After that, more than 140 million people would be hostages of the state propaganda narrative. Only two major platforms have partially survived this purge for now. Telegram and YouTube are the only spaces left for Russian journalists to try to inform their fellow citizens about the reality of the war waged in their name by Vladimir Putin. The joint statement continued \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We do not want to live in a new cold war era. There is an urgent need to reconnect Russian citizens with pluralistic information, and with the rest of the world.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is the essence of the internet to provide this function,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd continues the statement addressed to the heads of global tech giants including the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, the Twitter CEO, Elon Musk, and the Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we need now is to establish a communication channel between representatives of the platforms and us, to build together solutions to reconnect Russian citizens with their independent press in exile.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Russian citizens will find themselves locked in the dark alone with their president\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if free information on the internet is not supported. The past few days have seen a very marked intensification of fighting south of Zaporizhzhia in the direction of the key town of Tokmak. While the situation remains highly confused, some Russian military bloggers have been speculating that this might be the beginning of the long anticipated Ukrainian summer offensive. Nasa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s satellite monitoring of fires in that area of the frontline confirms what Russian bloggers have been saying: that the area around Tokmak and Orihiv first under very heavy preparatory shelling followed by a Ukrainian attempt to break through Russian defences towards Tokmak. This area of the front has long been seen as a likely axis for a Ukrainian assault towards Melitopol, not least because Tokmak itself is a major railway junction and Russian logistical hub that has key lines of communication with both Mauripol and Berdiansk. Russia has long feared a Ukrainian advance here building multi-layered defences including zigzag trenches, dragon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teeth, minefields and other obstacles also reinforcing the area with both troops and medical personnel. On Telegram, the Russian military blogger channel War Gonzo said it remained \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early to say\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that the Ukrainian offensive had become bogged down, describing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard night\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Russian forces around Orihiv. It added: It is reported from the scene that in the direction of Orehiv-Tokmak the enemy infantry continues to approach and try to gain a foothold. Enemy artillery and tanks are still intensively working on our positions. Our troops hold the line and do not allow a breakthrough of the front, destroying enemy manpower and equipment. According to information from the field, our fighters managed to knock out a tank similar to the Leopard, but it is still impossible to identify the destroyed equipment for certain. Other Russian online sources spoke of an assault with armour and infantry with the village of Robotyne being a focus of Ukrainian assaults in the past 24 hours with both Ukrainian and Russian aviation active in the sector. On Thursday there were also reports that the Russian occupation administration had ordered evacuations from settlements around Tokmak. It remains unclear, however, whether the fighting in the Tokmak area represents Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main effort. While it appears to be more substantial than a reconnaissance in force, it is possible that the push in recent days could be a so called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demonstration\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd designed to persuade Moscow that the main advance will be in the direction of Melitopol. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general staff will also be using the current assault to gather active intelligence on the quality of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defensive positions as it moves forward. The cooling pond at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is in danger of collapse as a result of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam and the draining of its reservoir, according to a French nuclear safety organisation. Without the reservoir on the other side to counteract it, the internal pressure of the water in the cooling pool could breach the dike around it, a report by the Paris-based Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) said. Officials at the Ukrainian nuclear energy corporation, Energoatom, said that any collapse in the dike around the cooling pond would be partial even in a worst case scenario and there would still be sufficient water to keep reactor cores and spent fuel cool, but a loss of the cooling pool would dramatically increase safety concerns over the plant. Since the collapse of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday, for which Ukraine, the UN, EU and other world leaders are holding Russia responsible, its reservoir has been draining into the Dnipro river and the Black Sea beyond, and will soon drop below the water intakes used to pump water into an array of spray ponds used to cool the reactor cores. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Mariano Grossi said: It is vital that this cooling pond remains intact. Nothing must be done to potentially undermine its integrity. Karine Herviou, the IRSN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy director general for nuclear safety, said that because all six reactors at the Zaporizhzhia plant had been shut down some months ago as a result of fighting in the area, the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cooling needs are limited and could be met by other means. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the dyke is destroyed as a result of the water pressure, there are other means to replenish the spray ponds, like pump trucks bringing water from the Dnipro or other water basin located nearby,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Herviou told the Guardian. The president of Energoatom, Petro Kotin, said today that the current water supply at Zaporizhzhia is enough \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to keep the nuclear power plant in a safe mode of operation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but he warned of the threat of Russian sabotage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is heavily mined - both the interior and the access roads to it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We currently have no information about whether the Russians have mined the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equipment. This will become known after the plant is liberated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dan Sabbagh has tweeted from the village of Bilozerka, west of Kherson, where two dozen houses were underwater. The World Health Organization has rushed emergency supplies to flood-hit parts of Ukraine and are preparing to respond to an array of health risks including trauma, drowning and waterborne diseases such as cholera, officials said on Thursday. Russia and Ukraine have traded blame for the bursting of the Soviet-era Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, which sent waters cascading across the war zone of southern Ukraine in the early hours of Tuesday, forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes. Reuters reports: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water supply sanitation systems and public health services cannot be underestimated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a press briefing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The WHO has rushed in to support the authorities and health care workers in preventive measures against waterborne diseases and to improve disease surveillance.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked specifically about cholera, WHO technical officer Teresa Zakaria said that the risk of an outbreak was present since the pathogen exists in the environment. She said that the WHO was working with Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health ministry to put mechanisms in place to ensure that vaccines can be imported if needed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are trying to address quite a wide range of health risks actually associated with the floods, starting from trauma to drowning, to waterborne diseases but also all the way to the potential implications of disruption to chronic treatment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she added. The huge Kakhovka dam on the Dnipro River separates Russian and Ukrainian forces and people have been affected on both sides of its banks. WHO\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emergencies director, Mike Ryan, said the WHO has offered assistance to Russian-controlled areas but that its operational presence was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153primarily\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the Ukrainian side. He said Russian authorities had given them assurances that people living in areas it occupies were being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well monitored, well cared for, well fed [and] well supported\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will be delighted to be able to access those areas and be able to monitor health as we would in most situations wish to do,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, adding it would be for the Ukrainian and Russian authorities to agree how that could be achieved. Ukraine could lose several million tons of crops because of flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in the south of the country, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Thursday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without a source of water supply, it is impossible to grow vegetables. Grain and oilseeds will be grown using an extensive model with low yields,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the ministry said in a statement, Reuters reports. The ministry said the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destruction would flood tens of thousands of hectares of agricultural land in southern Ukraine and could turn at least 500,000 hectares of land left without irrigation into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deserts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The ministry said the flooded land would require a full agro-ecological assessment of the soil condition and in most cases special soil restoration methods would need to be applied. It said vegetables, melons, grains and oilseeds were the main products which were grown on the affected land. Ukraine is a major global grain and oilseeds grower and exporter. The destruction of the dam on Tuesday, which Ukraine and Russia blame on each other, has also made it impossible to navigate parts of the Dnipro River and deprived Kyiv of an important agricultural export route, shipping authorities said. The agriculture minister, Mykola Solsky, also said the farm sector\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s losses could be much higher than previously expected because the disaster inflicted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of damage on irrigation. Drone footage shows the extent of flooding after the Ukraine dam collapse. Russian shelling killed a civilian in the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the Kakhovka dam, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcs prosecutor general claimed. The prosecutor general\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said two other people were wounded in the incident and that four were hurt in a separate location, and that a war crimes investigation had been opened. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Due to targeted strikes by the occupiers during evacuation measures in the city, a civilian died,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said in a statement, Reuters reports. The interior ministry said eight people had been wounded during Russian strikes on Kherson but mentioned no deaths. The ministry said the Russian shelling had begun \u00e2\u20ac\u0153precisely during the evacuation of citizens whose homes were flooded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ukrainian deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar has said that Russia is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153actively on the defensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Orikhiv area of Zaporizhzhia region, a possible confirmation that Ukraine is attacking in that direction. In an update on Telegram she said: In the east, our troops are active in the Bakhmut direction. Fighting continues. In some places, the enemy tries to go on the offensive, but without success \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in the Zaporizhzhia direction in the Orikhiv area, the enemy is actively on the defensive. Russian military bloggers on Telegram today have been posting about activity in the Zaporizhzhia region, and Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu is quoted by Tass as saying an attack has been repulsed. [See 13.59 BST] Tass quotes him saying: Today at 1.30am in the Zaporizhzhia direction, the enemy attempted to break through our defences with the forces of the 47th mechanised brigade, numbering up to 1,500 people and 150 armoured vehicles. The Tass report goes on to say that Shoigu claimed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as a result of a two-hour battle, the armed forces of Ukraine lost 30 tanks, 11 infantry fighting vehicles, and up to 350 personnel. Thus, the enemy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specially trained reserve forces for the implementation of this breakthrough did not fulfil their task.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking of the Russian defence minister, our central and eastern Europe correspondent Shaun Walker has this report: The investigations team of jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has released a new video in which it claims to have found a son of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence minister Sergei Shoigu, whose name was previously not known to the public. Over the past year, Shoigu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alleged son has been making cheesy pop songs in English while his father is sending tens of thousands of Russians to war in Ukraine. Previously, Shoigu was known to have two daughters, but Navalny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team say the defence minister had a secret second family in the early 2000s, and obtained documents it claimed showed his mistress had received a vast, lavish property despite a modest official salary. Navalny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team claimed 22-year-old Danila Shebunov was one of three children from Shoigu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second, secret, relationship, and said he also owned prime real estate in central Moscow. These properties allegedly bring Shebunov a sizeable income from rent, and were allegedly obtained thanks to his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s connections. Shebunov, who goes by the name Sheba Singer, has a rich social media presence, although few followers, and recently has produced a steady output of pop songs and lifestyle videos, usually in English and often involving him undressing. Maria Pevchikh of Navalny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Anti-Corruption Foundation, who presented the video investigation, asked ironically why it was that Shebunov was producing this kind of output rather than suffering in a trench in Ukraine along with thousands of Russian soldiers his age. For years, Navalny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team has made videos it says expose corruption and hypocrisy in Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elite. The latest video, 19 minutes long, had clocked up more than 100,000 views on YouTube within an hour of being posted. Neither Shoigu nor Shebunov have yet commented on the video. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said on Thursday that his forces had repelled overnight attempts by Ukrainian forces to break through the frontline in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s RIA news agency reported. Shoigu was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying that four separate Ukrainian attacks along the front had been halted and that Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces had been forced to retreat \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with heavy losses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. These claims have not been independently verified. At least three people were wounded in Russian shelling of the Ukrainian city of Kherson on Thursday as people were being evacuated because of flooding caused by the collapse of the nearby Kakhovka dam, police said. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interior ministry said in a statement: The shelling began precisely during the evacuation of citizens whose homes were flooded. It reiterated accusations that Russia had abandoned people in territory it occupied in the Kherson region, adding: And it continues to prevent Ukraine from saving the most valuable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c human lives. The Russian embassy has said the responsibility for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfolding tragedy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Kherson due to the destruction of the Kakhovka dam lies with Kyiv and western countries who have supplied Ukraine with weapons, in what they describe as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrorist plot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a statement, permanent representative Vassily Nebenzia at the UN security council (UNSC) briefing on the situation around the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant said: On the night of 5 June to 6 [June], the Kyiv regime committed an unthinkable crime. They blasted the dam of the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant, which resulted in an uncontrolled release of water downstream of the Dnipro River. Feeling its total impunity and being encouraged by western sponsors, the Kyiv regime decided to fulfil this terrorist plot this time. The responsibility for this unfolding tragedy fully rests with the Kyiv regime and its western masters who pump up Ukraine with weapons. The water level at a reservoir in southern Ukraine is approaching a dangerous low after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam, the state company overseeing the facility said on Thursday, which could affect the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station. Moscow and Kyiv blamed one another for the collapse of the dam on Tuesday, which unleashed water from the Dnipro River into a wide area of the Kherson region, Reuters reports. Ihor Syrota, general director of the energy company Ukrhydroenergo, told Ukrainian television that a drop below the current water level at the Kakhovka reservoir could affect the nearby Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station and water supply to other regions. He said: We are reaching this dead zone, which is 12.70 (meters), after which there will be not be any water intake either for the cooling ponds at the Zaporizhzhia station \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 or. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 for all regions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear energy company said on Thursday the situation was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stable and under control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the Zaporizhzhia plant on Thursday morning. Syrota added that Ukrhydroenergo was ready to work on an overlay across the damaged hydroelectric station and dam as soon as Russian forces left the eastern side of the Dnipro, and that it would take about two months to complete. Britain has announced a new sanctions package against Belarus on Thursday for its role in facilitating Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine, including import bans and new measures aimed at preventing internet propaganda. Belarus, led by president Alexander Lukashenko since 1994, is Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s staunchest ally among ex-Soviet states and allowed its territory to be used to launch the Kremlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Last month Russia moved ahead with a decision to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. James Cleverly, the British foreign secretary, said in a statement: This new package ratchets up the economic pressure on Lukashenko and his regime which actively facilitates the Russian war effort and ignores Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s territorial integrity. The new package includes banning the import of gold, cement, wood and rubber from Belarus and blocking exports to Belarus from Britain of banknotes and machinery, as well as goods, technologies and materials that could be used to produce chemical and biological weapons. Britain said it would also be able to prevent designated Belarusian media companies from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spreading propaganda in the UK\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with social media companies and internet service providers restricting access to the websites of sanctioned Belarusian media organisations. Flooding caused by the destruction of the Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine has forced Russian troops to retreat by distances of five to 15km (three to nine miles) in the Kherson region, a military spokesperson said. Natalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern command, told Ukrainian television the redeployment had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153practically halved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Russian shelling in the region, Reuters reports. Russia has not yet commented. The Russian-installed governor of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kherson region, Vladimir Saldo, said on Thursday that Ukraine had shelled an evacuation point for civilians affected by the Kakhovka dam breach in the town of Hola Prystan, killing two people, Reuters reports. The governor of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Belgorod region said in a statement posted on Telegram that two settlements in the region had been attacked by drones. Belgorod, which borders Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kharkiv region, has come under repeated attack from Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces in recent weeks. These claims have not been independently verified. More information to come \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked the staff at one of Kherson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hospitals for their work in helping people affected by the explosion at the Nova Kakhovka dam during a visit. In a tweet, he described medics as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153heroic people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and wished patients good health. The Kremlin on Thursday accused Ukraine of shelling Russian rescue workers in the area flooded after the huge Kakhovka dam in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kherson region was breached earlier this week. It did not provide any immediate evidence for its assertion. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, did not currently have any plans to visit the disaster area. Here are some more images that have been sent to us over the news wires, showing the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, visiting people at a hospital that is being used as one of Kherson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evacuation points. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president said the main issues discussed during the visit were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organisation of life support for the flooded areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear and rapid reaction from the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross who he said were not helping the relief effort. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region was under water on Thursday, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Five people have died due to flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station according to the Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Nova Kakhovka, the nearest settlement to the dam. Russian media has claimed that over 14,000 houses were flooded, and almost 4,300 people were evacuated in occupied Kherson, but the claims have not been independently verified. Volodymyr Litvinov, the head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, reported that there was a risk of flooding further inland, due to rising level of the Inhulets River, which feeds into the Dnipro. The International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reactors. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-owned news agency Tass reported that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153missiles flew over Luhansk, several explosions were heard in the city\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a new statement about the situation with shelters in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital, saying that the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s council will warn the owners of private premises with shelters that if they are not properly maintained, or people are not admitted during an air raid, these premises may be seized from them. It follows the deaths last week of three people who were unable to get into a locked shelter and were then hit by falling debris from a Russian missile attack. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during which he briefed Putin on the forthcoming African leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 peace mission to Russia and Ukraine, the South African presidency said. The US president, Joe Biden, is to welcome the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-Russian invasion of Ukraine would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top of mind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Mabel Banfield-Nwachi will be here shortly to take you through the next few hours of our live coverage. Russian Industry and Trade minister Denis Manturov said on Thursday that Moscow has no access to the damaged part of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline, and does not expect to be granted it, the Interfax news agency reported. Russia has made the restart of the pipeline, which before the war carried ammonia from Russia to Ukraine for export, central to future renewal of a deal allowing Ukraine to export its grain safely from its Black Sea ports. Reuters reports that both Russia and Ukraine this week claimed there was damage to a section of the pipeline that runs through the frontline between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kharkiv region. The two sides have blamed each other. The water level in the North Crimean Canal, which carries water from the Kakhovka reservoir behind the breached Kakhovka dam to the Crimean peninsula, remains stable, Reuters reports the Russian-imposed governor of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, said on Thursday. Crimea relies heavily on water transported by the canal. After Moscow seized the peninsula in 2014, claiming to have annexed it, Kyiv blocked the canal. Mines uprooted and dispersed by flood waters surging downstream from the breached Kakhovka dam across swathes of southern Ukraine could pose a grave danger to civilians for decades to come, the Red Cross said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the past we knew where the hazards were. Now we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. All we know is that they are somewhere downstream,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Erik Tollefsen, head of the Weapon Contamination Unit at the International Committee of the Red Cross. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is with a certain horror that we look at the news coming out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters reports Tollefsen said in an audio clip, adding that the second world war mines found underwater in Denmark in 2015 were still active. Besides anti-personnel mines, both sides have used vast amounts of artillery shells and anti-tank mines. The exact number of mines in Ukraine is unclear, said Tollefsen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We just know the numbers are massive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tollefsen. Tollefsen said the issue with mines was not necessarily the nominal number of mines but where they were laid \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in a heavily agricultural country such as Ukraine. Here are some of the first images to be released of Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kherson. They show Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president touring the flooded area and speaking to Ihor Klymenko, the head of the national police. Volodymyr Litvinov, the head of the Beryslav district administration in Kherson region, reports that there is a risk of flooding further inland, due to rising level of the Inhulets River. He has posted to Telegram: In connection with the explosion of the Kakhovskaya HPP dam, there was an uncontrolled flow of water from the Dnipro River downstream. There is a rise in the water level in the Inhulets River, which flows into the Dnipro. Listing several villages near Kalynivske, which is about 22 miles (35km) from the Dnipro, Litvinov warned: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Due to the flooding of the bridge, it is not possible to travel to the village of Zapovit. The water is getting close to the homes of residents.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here are some images that have been sent to us over the news wires from occupied Ukraine, showing the impact of flooding in Nova Kakhovka, where the local Russian-imposed official has said five people have died. Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian presidency, has posted to Twitter video footage released by Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office of his meeting in Kherson. If you wanted something to listen to, today our Today in Focus podcast features my colleague Dan Sabbagh on the ground in Kherson talking about the aftermath of the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. You can listen to it here. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited the Kherson region that has been impacted by flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam. Three people are known to have died on the Ukraine-controlled bank of the Dnipro River, while occupying authorities on the left-bank have said at least five people were killed. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional governor, Oleksandr Prokudin, has said about 230 sq miles (600 sq km) of the region is under water, and that Ukraine has so far evacuated almost 2,000 people. In a post to Telegram, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president wrote: Working trip to Kherson region. A coordination meeting on the liquidation of consequences of the Kakhovka HPP dam explosion. Many important issues were discussed. The operational situation in the region as a result of the disaster, evacuation of the population from potential flood zones, elimination of the emergency caused by the dam explosion, organization of life support for the flooded areas. Also, the prospects for restoring the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ecosystem and the operational military situation in the man-made disaster area. It is important to calculate the damage and allocate funds to compensate residents affected by the disaster and develop a programme to compensate for losses or relocate businesses within the Kherson region. Five people have died due to flooding after the destruction of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station, Tass reports, citing the Russian-imposed mayor of occupied Nova Kakhovka, the nearest settlement to the dam. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a new statement about the situation with shelters in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital. He has been under pressure after people were killed when they were unable to get into a shelter. On Telegram, Klitschko wrote: Today, the Kyiv city council has to adopt a comprehensive draft decision concerning shelters. In particular, to warn the owners of private premises that if they are not properly maintained or people are not admitted during the air raid, these premises may be seized from them. About 230 square miles (600 sq km) of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine was under water on Thursday after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, the regional governor said. Oleksandr Prokudin said 68% of the flooded territory was on the Russian-occupied left bank of the Dnipro River. The average level of flooding in the Kherson region on Thursday morning was 5.61m (18.41ft), he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re already working. We will help everyone that has ended up in trouble,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Reuters reports he said in a video statement of the flooding, caused by the collapse of the dam. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Despite the immense danger and constant Russian shelling, evacuation from zones of flooding is continuing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prokudin said. He said almost 2,000 people had left flooded territory as of Thursday morning. Russian media reports that almost 4,300 people have been evacuated in the occupied area of Kherson. The claims have not been independently verified. Suspilne, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state broadcaster, citing the regional authority head of Kherson, reports that as of this morning \u00e2\u20ac\u0153almost 2,000 people have been evacuated from the flooded zone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the Dnipro River. The left bank of the Dnipro and southern portion of Kherson is occupied by Russia. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s state-owned news agency Tass has reported that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153missiles flew over Luhansk, several explosions were heard in the city\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The occupied city is the largest in the Luhansk region, one of four Ukrainian regions the Russian Federation claimed to have annexed in late 2022. More details soon \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, had a telephone call with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, during which he briefed Putin on the forthcoming African leaders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 peace mission to Russia and Ukraine, the South African presidency said on Thursday. Putin expressed his desire to receive the peace mission, Reuters reports the presidency statement said. Maxar has supplied these satellite images of the Nova Kakhovka dam. The first was taken on 5 June. The second shows the condition of the dam yesterday, on 7 June. The Russian state-owned news agency Tass, citing emergency services in the occupied southern portion of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kherson region, has said up to 14,000 homes have been flooded and nearly 4,300 people evacuated. In a status update on Telegram, Tass reported: Over 14,000 houses were flooded after the breakthrough of the Kakhovskaya hydroelectric power station, and almost 4,300 people were evacuated, emergency services report. Twenty-three people were seen by doctors of which 21 were hospitalised, medical services reported. Our First Edition morning newsletter today features my colleague Esther Addley talking to our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh, who is in Kherson. Here is an extract: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a huge crisis,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dan Sabbagh, adding that there is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something elemental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about the scale of the flooding. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a massive river. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where the river boundary will end up. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what the new landscape will look like.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The water was still rising, though more slowly than before, when Dan spoke to me yesterday from central Kherson. He was standing at a crossroads that ordinarily would be hundreds of metres from the riverbank; instead, he said, the kerb had become \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite a busy little port\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as rescue boats came and went. For eight months last year, Kherson was occupied by Russian forces; parts of it have been heavily damaged by shelling and many people had already left the city by the time the floods hit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Younger people tend to get out as fast as they can,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Dan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The residents who have stayed on are mostly older, and have point blank refused to go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For many of those who remained, though, the flooding has forced them out of the homes they resolutely refused to quit. As we spoke, Dan described an inflatable dinghy arriving, carrying a woman in her 70s and an older man who was unable to walk, who had been rescued along with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the obligatory dog\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A basket of five brown cats had been brought in a little earlier; in the background a dog was barking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are a lot of abandoned pets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you see them everywhere. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a feature of a war zone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Read more here: Thursday briefing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Kherson dam disaster has left thousands of Ukrainians adrift, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the start You can sign up for our free daily newsletter First Edition. The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has this morning insisted that, in the wake of the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, the war is not regarded as a conflict between neighbours. She tweeted: There is no equivalence in the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conflict\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between neighbours. It is an illegal invasion by Russia. Whose efforts have gone beyond stealing Ukrainian land to destroying it and the Ukrainian people who live peacefully on it.

The Associated Press reports that Sunak is also looking to make the case to Biden for UK Defence Minister Ben Wallace to succeed outgoing Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who is set to end his term leading the 31-member alliance in September. Stoltenberg is slated to meet with Biden in Washington on Monday, and leaders from the alliance are set to gather in Lithuania on 11-12 July for their annual summit. President Joe Biden is welcoming Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for wide-ranging talks on Thursday as the British leader makes his first White House visit as premier. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the 15-month-old Russian invasion of Ukraine will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153top of mind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the Associated Press reports. The US and UK are the two biggest donors to the Ukraine war effort and play a central role in a long-term effort announced last month to train, and eventually equip, Ukrainian pilots on F-16 fighter jets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The two leaders will review a range of global issues including our economic partnership or shared support of Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war of aggression, as well as further action to accelerate the clean energy transition,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jean-Pierre said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The president and the prime minister will also discuss the joint US-UK leadership on critical emerging technologies as well as our work to strengthen our economic security.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an address on Wednesday evening, Zelenskiy said it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied parts of Kherson due to the flooding, urging a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear and rapid reaction from the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to support victims. He also severely criticised the UN and the Red Cross who he said were not helping the relief effort. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our military and special services are rescuing people as much as it is possible, despite the shelling. But large-scale efforts are needed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need international organisations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, to immediately join the rescue operation and help people in the occupied part of Kherson region. That update from the International Atomic Energy explains that while all six of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reactors are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in shutdown mode\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cooling water is still needed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to prevent fuel melt and a possible release of radioactive material\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reactors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In view of the IAEA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intensifying activities under the newly established principles, he will also strengthen the IAEA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence at the site, replacing the current team with a larger group travelling with him across the frontline,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the IAEA announced in an update on Wednesday. It quoted Director General Grossi as saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The possible loss of the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main source of cooling water further complicates an already extremely difficult and challenging nuclear safety and security situation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The update outlines threats to the water supply for ponds that feed cool the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear reactors. The agency said that it was working to ensure that there was as much cooling water in reserve as possible in the event that it could no longer access the Kakhovka reservoir. The reservoir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water levels were continuing to drop, the agency said. It explained that the reservoir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water levels had already fallen by 2.8 metres since Tuesday, but that the hourly rate of loss had slowed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 between 5 and 7 centimetres per hour from a peak of around 11 cm/hour yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the level falls below 12.7 metres, the ZNPP will no longer be able to pump water from the reservoir to the site.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it said, adding that this level could be reached in two days. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Preparing for such a possibility, the ZNPP is continuously replenishing its water reserves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the large cooling pond next to the plant as well as its smaller sprinkler cooling ponds and the adjacent channels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c by fully utilising the water of the Kakhovka reservoir while this still remains possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Three people have died as a result of flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam in southern Ukraine, local media have reported, in what would be the first confirmed deaths, as President Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced fears for the lives of Ukrainians in Russian-held areas hit by the disaster. Citing the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Oleshky, Yevhen Ryshchuk, the Kyiv Independent reported that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153three people drowned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the Kherson region. Welcome back to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This is Helen Sullivan with the latest. At least three people have been confirmed dead as a result of flooding from the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, Ukrainian media outlets reported on Wednesday, citing the exiled mayor of the Russian-occupied city of Oleshky in Kherson region. And the International Atomic Energy Agency has announced that it will strengthen its presence at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear energy plant amid concerns over water supplies for cooling the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reactors. More on these stories shortly. Here are the other key recent developments: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address that it was impossible to predict how many people would die in Russian-occupied areas due to the flooding, urging a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clear and rapid reaction from the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to support victims. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The situation in occupied parts of the Kherson region is absolutely catastrophic. The occupiers are simply abandoning people in frightful conditions. No help, without water, left on the roofs of houses in submerged communities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If an international organisation is not present in the disaster zone, it means it does not exist at all or is incapable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have been left \u00e2\u20ac\u0153without normal access to drinking water\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after the destruction, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned. The Ukrainian leader said the evacuation of people and the urgent provision of drinking water were top priorities. The World Bank will support Ukraine by conducting a rapid assessment of damages and needs, a top bank official said on Wednesday. Anna Bjerde, the World Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s managing director for operations, said the destruction of the Novo Kakhovka dam had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many very serious consequences for essential service delivery and the broader environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Drone footage showed roads and buildings in Kherson completely submerged by flood water. The critical dam, which lies along the Dnipro River in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kherson region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now held by Russia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c collapsed on Tuesday, flooding a swathe of the war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frontline. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an, told Putin in a phone call on Wednesday that a comprehensive investigation was needed into the destruction of the dam. Erdo\u00c4\u0178an told Putin that an international commission that includes the UN and Turkey could be formed to look into the issue, a statement from the Turkish president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office said. Britain cannot yet say Russia is responsible for the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, prime minister Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday. Asked during a visit to the US whether Russia was responsible, Sunak said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that definitively yet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if true it will represent a new low. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an appalling act of barbarism on Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The US \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot say conclusively\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who was responsible for the destruction of the dam, national security council spokesperson John Kirby said on Tuesday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing the best we can to assess\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he told reporters at the White House, noting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153destruction of civilian infrastructure is not allowed by the laws of war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. France will send aid to Ukraine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to meet immediate needs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after the destruction of the dam, President Emmanuel Macron has said. Macron said he expressed solidarity with the people of Ukraine in the aftermath of what he described as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153atrocious act which is endangering populations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A top Moscow-backed official in a part of Ukraine controlled by Russia has said that the collapse of the dam has handed the Russian military a tactical advantage. Vladimir Saldo said he believed Kyiv was to blame for the disaster but that the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destruction and resulting flood waters would make it easier for Russia to defend against any Ukrainian counter-offensive in the area. Relief workers on the Ukraine-controlled right bank of the river have reported having to work under fire. The UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s humanitarian aid agency warned the disaster \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will likely get worse in the coming hours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with access to drinking water and health risks associated with contaminated water among the most pressing concerns. Ukraine has not yet launched a planned counteroffensive to win back territory occupied by Russia, a senior Ukrainian security official said on Wednesday. Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national security and defence council, dismissed statements by Russian officials who have said the counteroffensive has already begun, adding that its start will be obvious to everyone when it happens. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence ministry has said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ukrainian saboteurs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had blown up a section of the Togliatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline on Monday, which carries fertiliser from Russia to Ukraine in Kharkiv region. There was no immediate comment on the allegations from Ukraine. A group of Nato countries may be willing to put troops on the ground in Ukraine if member states do not provide tangible security guarantees to Kyiv at the alliances\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s summit in Vilnius, the former Nato secretary general Anders Rasmussen has said. Current Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance must discuss options for giving Ukraine security assurances for the time after its war with Russia."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/08/cricket-england-australia-ashes-steve-smith-batting-immortal", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Beware, England: Steve Smith looks like a batting immortal again | Geoff Lemon", "lead": "The Australian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominant century in the World Test Championship final against India strikes an ominous note before the Ashes", "author": "Geoff Lemon at the Kia Oval", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T17:52:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897091", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/15cce774dbd876551f2f6965863e5498b4cde6e6/0_35_2061_1236/500.jpg", "body": "From time to time around the Oval press box, little English-accented groans of annoyance burbled through the quiet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh God. Here we go again.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Steve Smith was the cause, across the first two days of the World Test Championship final. Through the tinted windows placed just behind the bowler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arm at the Vauxhall End was the perfect view of him, ball after ball: setting up outside leg stump, stepping across, nudging off his pads for a run on his way to 121. For British scribes who covered their last home Ashes in 2019, it was simply Smith picking up where he left off. They saw him do exactly that to the tune of 774 runs last time around, and any time your tally equals an ABC radio callsign you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing well. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe that between that series and now Smith returned to the realm of batting mortals. They can look at the numbers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 28 Tests, four centuries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite believe what they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there to see. It was striking how much Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hundred at the Oval resembled those from his last visit to England. There was the same bloodymindedness, a fully embodied determination that he was not going to accept anything less from his time in the middle. There was that scoring strike rate that spent most of the first day in the 30s before finally nudging up to 41. There were the 19 boundaries, only half a dozen of which went through the off-side between mid-off and point. Above all, there was a return to the technique that worked so well last time. During the interim, Smith had taken guard more centrally in front of the stumps and stayed more still at the crease while waiting for the bowler to arrive. It worked for him in Sri Lanka in 2022, with his unbeaten 145 in Galle. That innings felt significant. For a six-year span between 2013 and 2019, he made 26 hundreds. After Manchester 2019, it was one century in nearly three years, a pandemic notwithstanding. Then came Galle, and soon afterwards a century against South Africa and a double against West Indies. For those last three Smith used the new technique, where he tried to stay more side-on to the ball and not to move. Part of his explanation was that it kept his body to the leg-side of the ball, opening up the off-side so he could score more aggressively through cover. Especially against the generally faster pace of South Africa, that helped his scoring options. And with less movement off the surface in Australia, it was a safe method as well. England, though, is a different situation, so his English method has been dusted off. Much discussed, examined, parodied, its manic ceaselessness is as striking as its unusual formation. Smith starts with a wander towards square leg as the bowler walks back. He taps left pad, right pad, box. Left, right, box. Faces up with feet almost outside leg stump. Tap the bat once, then twice quickly. Dip the knees. Tap. Dip. Then goes right across to the off-stump, standing almost outside it before the bowler arrives. The technical implication is that the step across gives him momentum and switches him on for each delivery, while the eventual positioning helps protect against the persistent and later swing that a Dukes ball can offer. Once his foot reaches the line of off-stump, he knows that anything swinging away will miss the timber, and he can play the line while letting the ball move away if need be. Anything that swings back in becomes a ball on the pads rather than one threatening the gate, and he backs his eye to be able to play that ball away as he would any straight one. The main question is whether his play off the pads is still as airtight as it was, if Jimmy Anderson and company are able to find appreciable movement with a useful set of Dukes. Up until 2019 he seemed almost impervious to lbw dismissals when the ball moved inwards from right-arm medium-fast seamers. Since then it has seemed to happen more often, including during his recent county stint with Sussex. India did try that at the Oval, though, as well as the plan that others have used of attacking Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ribs with a leg slip in place to get him fending catches while moving across. Neither worked this time around, as he helped Australia to 469. Even with the host team not playing this match, you could anticipate them feeling some trepidation before the Ashes. To stop Smith going back to the future, England will need to do more than just reach 88mph."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/its-unbelievable-annecy-shocked-by-knife-attack-on-young-children-in-park", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unbelievable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Annecy shocked by knife attack on young children in park", "lead": "Four very young children and two adults were stabbed in a lakeside playground in the French Alps city", "author": "Angelique Chrisafis", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T17:45:02Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897094", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3291e053a722d5f6b39cc300fe9fcb7b2dfdc83d/0_400_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "It was a sunny mid-morning at the edge of one of France\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most beautiful lakes, framed by mountains and park lawns in the picturesque French Alps city of Annecy. The quiet, waterside playground, with a slide and climbing frame, was a favourite for local toddlers with their parents and childminders as well as tourists. High school children were also milling around in the morning shade. Annecy had been in the news recently only for concerns over too much Airbnb accommodation in tourist towns \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and for its famous animated film festival, which was due to start on Sunday. At 9.45am there were sounds of women shouting for help from the park and screaming, grabbing children and running, calling for police. Witnesses said an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153indescribable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd horror unfolded as toddlers and babies were stabbed and bleeding. As children played, a man with a knife with a 10-centimetre blade had jumped the fence and gone first towards a woman with a pushchair, who screamed for help as he reached for babies then headed for toddlers. An ice-cream seller and other local people recognised the man \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dressed in black and wearing sunglasses and a bandana \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who they said had been sitting near the park in previous months. They said he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seemed dangerous in previous weeks; he sometimes said hello and was often sitting on a bench with a bag beside him, looking out at the lake. But he was always alone. Investigators are still trying to determine why on Thursday morning the man in his early 30s, who the French prime minister said was a homeless Syrian with refugee status in Sweden, and who was described by police sources to the French media as a Christian, had gone into the park brandishing a knife. He had at first deliberately ignored adults in order to specifically stab toddlers. In a video taken by a bystander and viewed by AFP, the man could be heard shouting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the name of Jesus Christ\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The local prosecutor said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no apparent terrorist motive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the attack at this stage. The man was not drunk, or under the influence of drugs, the prosecutor said. Annecy was plunged into a state of shock and confusion. One young woman who had been playing boules near the playground told local France Bleu Pays de Savoie radio that at first she had been puzzled when she saw the man jump the fence around the playground and run towards children. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand, I thought it was a game,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He jumped the barrier, stabbed a little girl, then a baby in a pushchair. I thought it was a toy. I thought it was a joke, but no, he had a real knife. When I heard a mum screaming, I turned and ran.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Christina, who worked in the area near the park, said she saw a child bleeding heavily. She thought there had been a bike accident. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But there was a group of young people who seemed in a state of shock and were telling police cars where to go when they arrived,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. An older retired man who had been cycling on a lakeside cycle path told LCI TV: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I saw a little child, I saw blood across their stomach, I thought \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthat isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an accident caused by a swing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then saw people running, screaming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A refuse collector said he and colleagues were on their morning round emptying bins \u00e2\u20ac\u0153when we saw people running, carrying their children\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They tried to step in to stop the attacker; he ran out on to the lawns near the lake and at that moment, police officers arrived and gave chase. Meanwhile, a passerby carrying a rucksack had attempted to pursue the attacker across the park lawns, trying to throw or swing his heavy bag at him. The former Liverpool footballer Anthony Le Tallec (above), who was out on a lakeside run, described how police chased the attacker on foot. But the attacker then lunged at a 70-year-old man, stabbing and wounding him, before police fired shots and arrested him. The 70-year-old man was also hit by ammunition from a police weapon during the arrest and was being treated for his injuries. Four children were critically injured and treated in hospital. One was 22 months old, two were two years old, and one three years old. One of the children was British and another Dutch. Dozens more young children who had witnessed other toddlers being stabbed were being given psychological support, as were parents and childminders who had been in the park, and park workers. Children at a nearby school were locked down to be kept safe before their parents came to collect them. There were fears that the attacker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status as a refugee in Sweden, free to travel in the EU, could immediately spark spontaneous extreme-right street demonstrations over immigration policy in France. Annecy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Green party mayor and local politicians called for calm. France was in shock. The horror and incomprehension brought back grim memories of another attack on children in 2012 when the radicalised, unemployed panel-beater Mohamed Merah killed seven people, including three children and a rabbi, at a Jewish school in the southern city of Toulouse. There was incomprehension in this quiet corner of the Alps that very young children could be targeted in this way.

Al Arfat Hassan, of Enfield, north London, is on trial at Sheffield crown court alongside a 16-year-old boy, both accused of preparing terrorist acts. Hassan, 20, known as Official TS in his drill videos, used \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cupcakes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a code word for bomb among his friends as he compiled the materials to make an explosive, the prosecution said. He is also charged with possessing an explosive substance under suspicious circumstances, while the 16-year-old, from Roundhay, Leeds, is accused of possessing a document likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing to commit an act of terrorism. The pair watched violent IS propaganda videos in which people were murdered in gruesome ways and planned to carry out their own attacks to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153martyr\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd themselves, said the prosecutor, Jonathan Sandiford KC. The defendants had built a collection of knives between them, with Hassan having posed as an antiques dealer to get hold of a samurai sword, and the 16-year-old using his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s driving licence to order a number of knives online, the jury heard. The jury also heard that Hassan had bought the household chemicals hydrogen peroxide and acetone on Amazon to turn into a bomb and that he had identified a target location in central London. Hassan was part of a group he called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153four lions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Sandiford said, which also happens to be the title of a 2010 film by the satirist Chris Morris about a group of hapless terrorists whose plans are largely foiled by the authorities and by their own stupidity. The younger defendant \u00e2\u20ac\u0153had a particular hatred of people who were homosexual\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and watched videos featuring the murder of gay people by stoning, beheading and being thrown from high places, Sandiford said. The jury was told how at the age of 14, he had told his mother: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just want to leave this world and meet Allah, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had enough \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 all I want now is martyrdom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hassan had also become radicalised in his late teens, Sandiford said, and the court heard how teachers at his school in Enfield said he had gone from being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cheeky and likable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd boy to being indoctrinated by extreme beliefs, saying he wanted to travel to Syria to fight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153His beliefs extended to seeking martyrdom in the cause of Islam,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sandiford said. The court heard how the younger defendant, who cannot be named due to his age, had an argument with his mother over sharia law after she called IS militants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bastards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the following months, she became increasingly concerned about her son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremist views and warned him to stay away from Hassan, a warning he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153did not heed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Sandiford said. On 27 February 2022, Hassan was stopped at Heathrow airport on the way to Bangladesh and his phones were seized. Six days later he was arrested after police found messages between the pair and extremist content. Hassan told police he was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153digital creator\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that everything he did was for artistic effect. On 12 March 2022, the boy was arrested at his home in Leeds. Upon arrest, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a 15-year-old. I live at home, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m chilling, why would I prepare a terrorist attack? Why would I do that? Do I look like that kind of person?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The court heard how after being interviewed by police, he issued a statement saying he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clearly used bravado and stupidity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and blamed the video games Call of Duty and Assassin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Creed for his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fascination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with weapons. He told police he suffered from anxiety and depression after being assaulted by a teacher in year 6 and had previously tried to end his life. He said he thought Hassan was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153got taken in by the hype\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Both defendants deny being terrorists.

Recently it was forced to make 10 staff redundant and to cut costs in other areas.

However, he had admitted the last few months had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard graft\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to make some tough calls, let staff go,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m feeling I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m getting there. But I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a magic bullet.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Meanwhile many of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top track and field stars will be starring in the Paris Diamond League meeting on Friday night, including the Olympic and world silver medallist Keely Hodgkinson, who begins her outdoor season over 800m. The 21-year-old faces the world indoor champion, Ajee Wilson, along with 2019 world champion, Halimah Nakaayi, and Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist, Raevyn Rogers. But Hodgkinson sounded confident, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m feeling good, training has been good, so I am ready to start the season with a bang.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dina Asher-Smith, who won bronze at last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world championships, will also be in action over 200m. Laura Muir, the Olympic 1500m silver medallist in Tokyo, moves up to 5,000m for the first time in six years to take on a stellar field that includes the recent 1500m world record holder, Faith Kipyegon, and three other world record-holders: Letesenbet Gidey, Beatrice Chepkoech and Ejgayehu Taye. It promises to be a memorable race, but there is plenty more in Paris to intrigue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the sight of Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the world and Olympic 400m hurdles champion, running a flat 400m. Many have speculated that McLaughlin-Levrone could one day get close to the 38-year-old world record of 47.60sec set by the East German Marita Koch, and she will need to be near her best to beat the Olympic 400m silver medallist, Marileidy Paulino from the Dominican Republic, and the 2019 world champion, Salwa Eid Naser, who is back after serving a doping ban."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-future-of-social-care-a-chance-for-labour", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "The Guardian view on the future of social care: a chance for Labour | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Conservative neglect of the system has been a disaster.

A government scheme will recruit volunteers to run errands, in a desperate attempt to lessen the problem of people stuck in hospital because they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be safely discharged. Tasks, including collecting prescriptions, will be allocated via an app. A far more substantial plan from the Fabian Society sets out a roadmap for what it hopes will be a Starmer-led government. It also shows up the present government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s scheme for the panicked quick fix that it is. But there is no easy solution for a social policy challenge that only gets more challenging the longer it is deferred. The population is ageing, more people with disabilities are living for longer, and the need for care continues to rise. Currently there are 165,000 vacancies in the sector, and data suggests that the workforce shrank last year. But still the party that has governed the country for the past 13 years shies away from implementing the reforms it commissioned from Andrew Dilnot in 2011, or even from more modest steps such as improved training (a \u00c2\u00a3500m boost to workforce spending was recently halved). Any future administration will, as a result of this damaging delay, have its work cut out. One of the points emphasised in the Fabian report, which was requested by the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, and funded by Unison, is that the question is not whether to spend more money on social care, but when and how. On the vexed question of how the cost of care is to be shared between the public purse and private savings, the authors do not commit themselves. This is a political move designed to spare Mr Streeting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blushes. Big spending promises, Labour fears, might trap the party with an election expected next year. This is a serious shortcoming. Improvements to adult social care provision depend on increased cash. Current problems include low wages and excessive dependence on heavily indebted, private equity-owned businesses. Thinktanks should not be afraid to advocate changes to the tax system or other funding mechanisms. But there is much that is useful in this latest attempt to grapple with the issue. The idea of resurrecting the national care service brand first proposed by Labour in 2010 is sound. More important than the name is what it means, and the proposal for nationally agreed pay and conditions combined with a new funding formula, via ringfenced central government grants to local authorities, is a good one. With regional inequalities as stark as they are, it is hard to envisage a more local solution to funding shortfalls, and some redistribution of resources to poorer areas is desirable. New regulation of private providers is also essential, though it is questionable whether they can be induced to deliver tightly drawn service specifications on the model of bus companies, as the report proposes. In the short term, volunteers may slightly ease the burden on public services, as they did during the pandemic. Unpaid carers make a vital contribution to society, and willingness from members of the public to help their neighbours should be appreciated. But such assistance is no substitute for a properly resourced and skilled workforce. Conservative ministers promised much but will have delivered nothing unless they keep their promise to introduce the Dilnot commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plan in 2025. This constructive report offers Labour the chance to show how much better it can be. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The actor Chris Mintz-Plasse, of Superbad fame, is keen to get away from the shouting hordes who won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop calling McLovin. Even funnier than Lynch immediately doing exactly that was McLovin listening to Schwartz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elevator pitch for his show, Vanderpump Rules: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s people who work at a restaurant, have sex with each other,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Schwartz explains. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jeez,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mintz-Plasse blushes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not doing that here, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They are exactly the kind of rich and pampered space cadets who figure out how to get first crack at civilizing Mars once they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re through cooking the rest of us with their Range Rover and private jet rides.

Zooming in from Earth, he sets the tone for a series that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take itself seriously even as its backdrops would have you believing otherwise.

That a single actor could be so impactful while sitting hands folded with tongue firmly in cheek is the real great leap for mankind. His crew is just as unpretentious. Armstrong is happy to play the geezer cyclist whose drugs-cheating rise and fall is lost on most of the cast. Winter initially mistakes him for the long deceased moonwalker Neil Armstrong, and Real Housewives of Atlanta fans will no doubt clock the irony of her being set straight by Porsha Williams \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the same peach-holder who was convinced the Underground Railroad was an actual transit system not that long ago.

The tender beats hit, too. Leggero and Williams bond over the young children they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve each left behind. Willis is frank about the withering effects of growing up in the shadow of three A-list parents, and Lynch is quick to uplift her when she shrinks from being named mission specialist. With the plot disasters already pre-manufactured, show producers didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to do much more to stir the kind of quiet moments you can imagine a bunch of strangers lumped together in space might have.

This high average level of pollution is well beyond the next largest such event, experienced in September 2020 on the US west coast following a record year of fires in the western states, and was far more severe for those directly in the path of the smoke, across much of the north-east US. In New York, where the sky went from a milky white to a Blade Runner orange over the course of a day when schools and playgrounds shut down outdoor activities and people started donning masks outside not worn since the early days of the pandemic, the particulate matter hit around 195 micrograms, more than five times above the national air quality standard. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The levels yesterday were quite dangerous, particularly if you are in a vulnerable group,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Burke, adding that this includes vast swaths of people such as the elderly, children, pregnant women and those with prior medical conditions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I expect we will see an uptick in respiratory hospitalizations, pre-term births and, sadly, mortalities.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Many New Yorkers stayed indoors rather than brave the campfire smell lingering on streets shrouded in smoke but even this did not fully shield most people, Burke said, with indoor air monitors in Manhattan showing that people experienced more than 100 micrograms of particulate matter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People had terrible indoor air too, just really bad,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even staying at home is not fully protective. Good luck to anyone trying to get an air filter anywhere in New York yesterday. The eastern seaboard luckily hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had to deal with air quality events like this before, so many people just weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Stanford research looks at wildfire smoke levels and gauges the average exposure for all Americans, and has done so since 2006. Burke said, however, that growth in both population and the severity of wildfires, driven by the climate crisis, means that it is unlikely that more people have ever previously been exposed to toxic wildfire smoke than on Wednesday. While previous blazes in California have caused similarly high levels of air pollution, the east coast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cluster of large cities means that more people have been exposed to harmful air than in previous events. New York City health officials have rolled out a list of safety measures to take as the city remains shrouded in a thick, smoky haze, which could last for several more days as smoke continues to pour from unusually widespread fires in Quebec. In addition to urging residents to wear high-quality masks such as N95s or KN95s, health officials are urging residents to keep windows closed, use an air purifier if possible, and if an air conditioner is on, to close the fresh air intake to prevent outdoor air from entering inside homes. Francesca Dominici, an expert in air pollution and climate at Harvard University, said that people should also refrain from exercising outdoors to avoid the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crazy levels\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of air pollution, but that she still expected a surge of hospitalizations from cardiovascular and respiratory problems triggered by the smoke. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can do some things to protect yourself but this just shows that climate change isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just affecting glaciers and polar bears, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s affecting us to the point we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t breathe clean air any more,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope as part of this crisis there is an opportunity to realize we need to act on climate change. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone from three years of not going out because of Covid and now we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go outside because of polluted air. The world and nature is telling us something, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sending us a very strong message.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-republican-primary-leader-of-the-unappetising-pack", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "The Guardian view on the Republican primary: leader of the unappetising pack | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> The candidates proliferate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Donald Trump, running both as former president and insurgent, is far ahead of them", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T17:25:36Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897114", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/81e8ec832612fdbab405097a49485db7c3b5f6b2/0_0_2824_1694/500.jpg", "body": "Donald Trump has an excess of companions in the race for the Republican nomination for 2024, but a paucity of rivals. The quantity of candidates in the presidential primary so far appears in inverse relationship to the threat they pose to him. The main question prompted by several recent declarees is not how they might win or what they might offer, but simply \u00e2\u20ac\u0153why?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Mike Pence, Chris Christie), or even \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (Perry Johnson). No one can predict what will happen in this race, and upsets do happen. Large fields and long shots positioning politicians for a future bid or the vice-presidential slot on the ticket are nothing new in primaries. Nor are improbable, often self-funded entrants. But the current flurry of activity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mr Pence, former New Jersey governor Mr Christie and North Dakota\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor Doug Burgum all announced runs this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seems to be prompted less by the belief that Mr Trump is beatable than by the belief that Ron DeSantis isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the man to beat him. The Florida governor surged in polls after winning by a landslide in the midterms, while Trump-backed candidates fell short. It did not last. Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s savaging of Mr DeSantis shows he takes nothing for granted. But he is polling more than 50% among Republicans, while Mr DeSantis is a distant second on about 20%. Mr Trump has the status of a former president, yet pitches himself as an insurgent. His personal conduct and erratic politics are already priced in, and he has delivered for his base \u00e2\u20ac\u201c notably on the supreme court and, therefore, abortion. Some still like the idea of Trumpism without Trump: a more competent, less reckless version of the former president. But Mr DeSantis has appeared awkward on the campaign trail. While he counts on a hard line on social issues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including abortion and the battle with Disney \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to help him regain ground, it may be unsettling donors. Mr Pence trails in distant third: though vice-presidents often win presidential nominations, he is loathed both for backing his former boss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s iniquities until the 11th hour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and for certifying 2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election results and rejecting the lie that Mr Trump had won. His support is in single digits, at about 5%, as is that for Nikki Haley, former governor of South Carolina, and Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambassador to the UN. Tim Scott, also of South Carolina, and only the second black Republican senator ever directly elected, has impressed some pundits but is even further behind. The concern of anti-Trump Republicans is that the sheer number of candidates will split the votes of those pondering an alternative. While Mr Christie has laid into Mr Trump, and Mr Pence did so in his campaign launch, Mr DeSantis has vacillated before hardening his line \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and still refuses to comment on Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claims that the last election was stolen. The others criticise him only in veiled terms. They hope to pick up Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters should he be hobbled, perhaps due to some unforeseen act or his multitude of legal woes. Prosecutors have formally notified the former president that he is a target of the criminal investigation examining the retention of national security materials. It is far from clear that any of the cases against him will obstruct his return. Yet the biggest threats to Mr Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political prospects still appear to remain outside his party.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it from me, but Simon Burnton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s match report is here for your entertainment. Thanks for your company and emails \u00e2\u20ac\u201c goodnight. Scott Boland (11-4-29-1) speaks I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been pretty nervous the last couple of days but it was nice to get into the game today. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very good player [Shubman Gill], so it was nice to knock him over early. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a really good spot now; hopefully we can take a few wickets in the morning. The pitch is going a little bit up and down, so hopefully it gets harder for India to bat tomorrow. That was a superb day for Australia, who are in control of this Test Championship final. Steve Smith made his 31st Test century in the morning before Travis Head was out for 163, the first of seven wickets to fall for 108. That slight collapse worked out okay for Australia because it kept the game moving and allowed them a good crack at India either side of tea. All the bowlers chipped in to reduce India to 149 for five, with Scott Boland the pick of the attack. India were in even more trouble at 71 for four before a defiant counterattack from Ravindra Jadeja. Nathan Lyon got him just before the close to reaffirm Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see how India can get out of this, although we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve said that a few times before. 38th over: India 151-5 (Rahane 29, Bharat 5) Bharat is beaten by a wide delivery from Starc that keeps very low, then offers no stroke to a ball that lifts sharply to crack him just above the elbow. With every passing over, India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to insert Australia looks more costly. Another visit from the physio ensures Starc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over is the last of the second day, although there is still time for Bharat to fresh-air a very windy drive. This will be the last over, in fact, because Bharat needs treatment after that blow from Boland. 37th over: India 147-5 (Rahane 29, Bharat 3) With the left-hander gone and Bharat newly at the crease, Scott Boland replaces Nathan Lyon (2-0-4-1). Rahane takes a single off the third ball, Bharat does likewise off the last, albeit after a painful blow on the glove. We should have time for two more overs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You may, or may not, want to post this rather startling advert,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Romeo. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bigger than me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This keeps appearing in the background during liveblogs. It seems to have had a subliminal effect: I ordered 12 Revitives from Argos in my sleep the other night and I still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what it is. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XwQmzbwDxo 36th over: India 145-5 (Rahane 28, Bharat 2) Bharat squeezes Starc through the covers for two to get off the mark. Starc has gone at more than a run a ball (8-0-50-1), but he did take the key wicket of Virat Kohli with a cracking delivery. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dismissal of Jadeja is not just a disaster for India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fading hopes but also a hammer-blow for cricket lovers who revel in his bat-twirling celebrations when he reaches fifty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Colum Fordham. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sad end to a gutsy innings.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always have, well, the last nine years. And probably the next four or five. 35th over: India 142-5 (Rahane 26, Bharat 0) Srikar Bharat is the new batter. That was Lyon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 483rd Test wicket; you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect him to join the big club this summer. Lyon strikes in his second over! This is such a vital wicket for Australia, because Jadeja was counterpunching superbly. It was a nice bit of deception from Lyon. Jadeja felt with hard hands for a dipping delivery that started wide and turned wider; it took the edge and Steve Smith did the rest at slip. 34th over: India 141-4 (Rahane 26, Jadeja 48) Mitchell Starc is going to have a burst before the close. Jadeja, who has played him very well today, steers a clever boundary past gully to move into the forties. He gets another two balls later with a thick edge that lands just short of Green at fourth slip and scuttles away to the fence. An expensive over, 13 from it. 33rd over: India 128-4 (Rahane 25, Jadeja 36) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finally time for the offspinner Nathan Lyon. As Ricky Ponting says on commentary, his mastery of overspin means he should get plenty of bounce on this pitch. An exploratory fisrt over yields three singles. India still trail by 341 runs, but this has been a good fightback. 32nd over: India 125-4 (Rahane 23, Jadeja 35) A big off-cutter from Boland dupes Rahane and hits him high on the pad. It was going over but that was lovely bowling. Boland has unquestionably been Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best bowler today: figures of 10-4-27-1 don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flatter him. Later in the over, Rahane turns a single to leg to bring up an important fifty partnership with Jadeja, and then Jadeja ends his mini-drought with an efficient cover drive for four. He is such a champion. 31st over: India 120-4 (Rahane 22, Jadeja 31) A delivery from Green to Jadeja bounces grotesquely and flies over the leaping Carey for four byes. That was a bit Edgbaston 95, though at least it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the first ball of the match. Another maiden from Green. Australia have done well to slow Jadeja\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counter-attack; since hitting that six off Boland he has gone 11 deliveries without scoring. 30th over: India 116-4 (Rahane 22, Jadeja 31) Boland errs slightly in length, which allows Rahane to time a cover drive for four. This is the bit where we remind you that Rahane has been India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overseas specialist in the past decade, with eight of his 12 Test centuries coming abroad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m trying to fool myself into believing this game is irrelevant for the Ashes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd weeps Sam Jeffers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s giving a false impression of what the Aussies can do. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a) The pitch is WAY too green. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re giving their bowlers one of these in the next few weeks. We are giving them absolute roads. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153b) India aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that good. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re missing Pant and Bumrah, and England handled them fairly well last summer in the leftover test with a team weaker than the one they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll put out next week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be fine. England 480-3 after the first day at Edgbaston. No nerves at all. None.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 29th over: India 112-4 (Rahane 18, Jadeja 31) Rahane scores his first run in 24 deliveries, and his first since he was LBW to a Cummins no-ball. It was the next ball, which trapped his bottom hand against the bat handle, that has led to a more cautious approach. 28.1 overs: India 111-4 (Rahane 17, Jadeja 31) A bumper from Green hits the helmet of Rahane, who was trying to hook, and ends in the hands of third slip. Australia discuss a review, thinking there might have been some glove, before deciding against it. The blow to the side of the helmet means a concussion check for Rahane, who has been in the wars this evening. 28th over: India 111-4 (Rahane 17, Jadeja 31) That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an outrageous shot from Jadeja, who flicks Boland extravagantly over square leg for six. Boland responds majestically, beating the outside edge and then having two strangled shouts for LBW. 27th over: India 105-4 (Rahane 17, Jadeja 25) Jadeja thumps another off-drive for four, this time off Green. Just under an hour until the close; Australia would love a couple more wickets to help them sleep tonight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Really hoping that India can hold on here and avoid a follow-on,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Rob Durbin, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not just to grind the Australian bowlers into the ground because of a more superficial reason. I have a corporate hospitality invite for Saturday and would really like to see some cricket and enjoy some free food and drink at the same time!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry. Even if they have the chance, there is precisely 0.00 per cent of Australia enforcing the follow-on. 26th over: India 100-4 (Rahane 17, Jadeja 20) Boland for Cummins, and hits the dinner plate outside off stump immediately. A maiden to Rahane. 25th over: India 100-4 (Rahane 17, Jadeja 20) Cameron Green returns after the drinks break in place of Mitchell Starc, whose figures of 6-0-34-1 are about right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but only if you recognise the manner and importance of the bit in the last column. An unpleasant lifter is left by Jadeja, who then steals a second run to bring up the hundred. As ever, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bristling with intent. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s such a winner, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s come an extremely long way since that match-losing cameo against England in the 2009 World T20. Meanwhile, how did I miss this? It looks like a great read. 24th over: India 98-4 (Rahane 17, Jadeja 18) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As an England supporter, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been willing Australia on to score as many big runs and take as many wickets as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Tom Van der Gucht. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not because I want them to win, but because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a weirdly spiritual view on players\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 purple patches. Rather than the Aussies playing themselves in for the Ashes, I feel that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re spending the runs they have in the bank and, once they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be bankrupt and due a run of low scores. The more the Aussies grind out now, the less they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have left for the next series... Physically, mentally and spiritually.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An admirable viewpoint, although I suspect Steve Smith subscribes to that chilling Don Bradman line: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe in the law of averages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. 23rd over: India 97-4 (Rahane 17, Jadeja 18) When play resumes, Jadeja belts Starc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first ball through mid-on for four. That takes him to 12, and he avoids the danger zone of 13-15 by clipping another boundary behind square on the leg side. This is a purposeful counter-attack from Jadeja, who has 17 from 20 balls. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is looking ominous for India\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and England,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Adam Hirst. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see our bowlers bowling them all out twice/cheaply, and it is getting difficult to see our batters keeping them out. Optimism sinking slowly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And now the Ashes summer has begun. Rahane is still being treated. It was a very nasty blow, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waiting for somebody to run some new gloves onto the field. Replays confirm that Rahane would have been out but for the no-ball. It was a beautiful delivery which straightened to beat Rahane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defensive stroke and hit the pad in front of off stump. 22nd over: India 88-4 (Rahane 17, Jadeja 8) That was Cummins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 fourth no-ball in eight overs today, and I was just about to type that he was straining for rhythm. He responds with an angry lifter that thumps Rahane painfully on the bottom hand; there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a break in play while Rahane receives treatment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we need to be careful about results \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgalvanising fans/viewers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (infers for commercial interests),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Nick Jones. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ditto Real Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus winning a league or cup. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Owners and broadcaster want big commercial teams to win title for big commercial reasons. This is a problematic dance. A viewer, a fan should demand competition and accept the result - be it unpopular.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well, well. Rahane, on 17, was trapped in front by a jaffa from Cummins, and reviewed the decision probably more in hope than expectation. Maybe he thought he was outside the line? It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to that, because replays showed Cummins \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who has had no-ball problems today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had just overstepped. 21st over: India 83-4 (Rahane 13, Jadeja 8) Jadeja punches Starc through mid-on for four, a statement of intent to counterattack, then survives a hopeful LBW appeal. It was missing leg. India are going at four an over despite the loss of those early wickets. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jagger will be 80 in 48 days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Romeo, an observation that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as random as it might sound: a couple of overs ago, the camera cut to the big man enjoying the cricket at the Oval. 20th over: India 79-4 (Rahane 13, Jadeja 4) India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top four all scored between 13 and 15, which has never happened before in a Test match. Three of the top four have scored 13-15 on a few occasions, including Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last year and Trent Bridge 2001. Cummins has a big LBW shout against Jadeja turned down by Richard Illingworth. It was very straight but probably pitched just outside leg, and Cummins talks his team out of talking him into a review. 19th over: India 72-4 (Rahane 12, Jadeja 1) That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the beauty of Mitchell Starc. No matter how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bowling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been great today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he always has the capacity to produce an absolute jaffa. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just seen a replay of the Kohli dismissal. The ball actually hit the thumb on Kohli\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right hand, not the glove or the splice. It was also a really sharp catch from Steve Smith. Starc almost makes it two in four balls when Ravindra Jadeja, trying to flick an outswinger to leg, gets a leading edge over point. Gottim! Kohli has fallen to a beauty from Mitchell Starc! It burst from a length to hit the splice, or maybe the glove, and Steve Smith took an excellent leaping catch at second slip. Kohli looks ruefully at the pitch before walking off; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure there was much he could do about that. 18th over: India 71-3 (Kohli 14, Rahane 12) Cummins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first delivery with the replacement ball is a loosener that Rahane pulls over square leg for four. His second is a beast, which jags back to cut Rahane in half. 17.2 overs: India 67-3 (Kohli 14, Rahane 8) Cummins has switched ends to replace Green. The ball needs to be changed, which means a slight delay. Make a cup of tea, put a record on: now\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good time. 17th over: India 67-3 (Kohli 14, Rahane 8) Starc replaces Boland, who helped put Australia on top with a fine spell of 6-3-12-1. Kohli drives his second ball through extra cover for four, a classic stroke that takes him into double figures. Maybe that 186 in Ahmedabad in March has relaxed him; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly looking in great touch. 16th over: India 61-3 (Kohli 9, Rahane 7) A couple of singles take Kohli to nine from 26 balls. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in this for the long haul, or at least he intends to be. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s missing from those Warne clips is the set-up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Richard O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hagan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like watching that Morecambe &amp; Wise sketch with Andre Previn but only looking at the bit with the piano. You need to see the build up to it and the way the whole thing is put together. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall either the Hollioake or Maynard dismissals that clearly (because in those days I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t watch television in the office) but I know there would have been a number of big spinning leg breaks in the balls before to convince the hapless batter that this one was going to be just the same. I particularly love the Hollioake one because Warne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s somehow got him to leave a ball that pitches in line with the stumps - but you need to see how he did it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fair point. He was probably the greatest rogue psychologist I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen in any sport. And he was particularly brilliant at hoodwinking inexperienced players: from memory that was Maynard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth Test and Hollioake\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second. See also Ian Bell at Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in 2005. 15th over: India 55-3 (Kohli 7, Rahane 4) India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top three all got into double figures, which will frustrate them even more. Though Australia have bowled very well, all three dismissals were avoidable: Rohit missed a straight one, Gill and Pujara left straight ones. Rahane gets off the mark from his second ball, deliberately uppercutting Boland over the cordon. 14th over: India 50-3 (Kohli 6, Rahane 0) Ajinyka Rahane is the new batter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rob, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m torn here between wanting India to win as due recognition for Virat Kohli\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s indelible role in giving Test cricket importance in India, especially overseas performances,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd begins Shankar Mony. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But at the same time, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want the BCCI to think that playing two months (or more! eeks) of IPL is good prep for a Test. What to do? Perhaps a dull boring tie?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think the Australian seamers got the memo. Cheteshwar Pujara has died by the leave. It was a very similar dismissal to Shubman Gill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, with Pujara shouldering arms to a ball from Green that nipped back to hit the off stump. Pujara goes for 14, and India are in all sorts. 13th over: India 49-2 (Pujara 14, Kohli 5) Pujara shapes to flap-hook a high bouncer from Boland, then thinks better of it. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s genuinely beaten by the next delivery, a perfectly pitched legcutter. Excellent stuff from Boland, a maiden. 12th over: India 48-2 (Pujara 14, Kohli 5) Cameroon Green replaces Pat Cummins, who bowled a good opening spell of 5-2-20-1. This is Test cricket 2023: forty per cent of Cummins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 overs were maidens and he still went at four an over. Pujara, who is looking good, gets his second boundary with a gorgeous back-foot square drive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Loved the Hollioake throwback (8th over)...\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says James Butler. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty sure there was an even better version of this dismissal that featured commentary (presumably on the BBC) by Richie Benaud. From memory there was a distinct Benaudesque pause before he uttered something like... \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI think feeble might be an appropriate description\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I thought it might be the dismissal below, but that has Tony Lewis on commentary. I remember Richie being quite scatching when Chris Lewis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on a pair, with a game to save \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was stumped on the stroke of lunch at Lord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in 1993. But that was a stumping rather than a leave. 11th over: India 42-2 (Pujara 8, Kohli 4) Boland starts the evening session with a widish lifter that surprises Pujara, who recoils as if confronted by a pair of malodorous socks. Later in the over he receives something more fragrant, a half-volley that is flipped through midwicket for four. This already has the feel of a fascinating arm-wrestle between Pujara and Boland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That Jack Hobbs record for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmost centuries scored in Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is remarkable both in itself but also because he played in an era when it took three weeks to get there - and he suffered from terrible sea sickness,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Richard Morris. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Makes everyone else on that list look like Johnny come latelys who had it all a bit too easy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hmm. This email has turned into an accidental homage to the four Yorkshiremen sketch.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Welcome home. The players are back out on the field, and Pat Cummins and Scott Boland are about to resume their interrogation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope you are not as hungover as I am after last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wonderful Prague events (Some sort of football match......),\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Rob Lewis, mistaking me for somebody who would write a cricket liveblog for a national newspaper while in a state of disrep- ah fair enough. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A shout-out please to my friend - since 1964 - Alan Thompson, who is at the Oval. He promised me he is not rooting for either side, which as a pleasant Brentford supporter is exactly the right tone. I wonder which side the England neutrals are backing?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The associates? Talking of which, I still can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get my head round the fact this was made in 1979. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like finding out somebody was playing T20 cricket in the late 1970s. Evening Viv. The future of Test cricket \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An India win would galvanise their fans/viewers, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important, but the most valuable move to ensure Test cricket flourishes is to let more teams play it, and that can only be done by funding associates much better,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Romeo. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdI believe, contrary to some narratives, that associate countries would absolutely love to play Test matches but they just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to stage them; even Ireland can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t - it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said a Test at Malahide costs $1m, or \u00c2\u00a31m or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1m or whatever to put on. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThere are a few stars from associates who want to play franchise cricket because they can make Loads of Money but those countries have others players who would love to play Test cricket. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe way to approach this is to turn the proposed distribution of ICC revenues upside down, so associates get the 38 per cent, not India. India have enough money already, and the same goes for England and Australia. Extend Test status widely, set up an informal Division Two of Test countries (some, like South Africa, choose which division to join, perhaps) and if national boards don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t risk bankruptcy they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll play Tests. \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdI believe there are very, very few cricketers who have never wanted to play a Test match. This won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen, of course, because the ICC board has only three associate country representatives out of 18, while there are 96 associates and 12 full members.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your problem. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the ICC, the most opaque organisation in cricket. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even access playing regulations if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an accredited journalist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I agree with pretty much every word. Sadly I think the most important phrase in the whole thing is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen, of course\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcof course\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is especially miserable, and not only because Richie Benaud said we should never use that phrase. We all know sport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greed has become irreversible. Teatime reading 10th over: India 37-2 (Pujara 3, Kohli 4) Cummins ends the session with a maiden to Kohli, who had no interest in trying anything funky. His first job was to get to tea, and how he and Pujara will hope to bat India back into the game in an extended evening session. The afternoon was a triumph for Australia. Their tail fell away, but that just moved the game along. More importantly, Pat Cummins and Scott Boland picked up the openers with the new ball. India will resume on 37 for two, still 432 runs behind. See you in 20 minutes. 9th over: India 37-2 (Pujara 3, Kohli 4) Pujara edges Boland short of the slips, a good advert for having Fairy Liquiad hands. Boland is making the batters play at almost every delivery, or at least making them think they need to play. That wicket of Gill takes his fledgling Test record to 29 wickets at an average of 12.96. When Boland goes a touch too straight, Pujara turns him through midwicket for a couple. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Afternoon, Uncle Rob,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Richard O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hagan, casually dropping a familial bomb on me mid-Test match. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If India lose another WTC due to having played nothing but T20 for the two months beforehand, how long do you think it will take the BCCI to start demanding that the final is played before the IPL starts so that they have a better chance of winning?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that just mean it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s played straight after another franchise league? 8th over: India 35-2 (Pujara 1, Kohli 4) Australia are all over India here. Kohli, trying to leave a ball from Cummins, inside-edges it past leg stump for four to get off the mark. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not sure I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve see a worse leave,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Robert Speed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Middle and off!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I can think of one or two from the golden age of Ashes cricket. (I know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s different with spin bowlers.) 7th over: India 30-2 (Pujara 0, Kohli 0) Scott Boland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s figures: 2-2-0-1. It was a dodgy leave from Gill, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true, but it really was terrific bowling. That relentless line and length, allied to the seam movement, would do your head in as a batter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just struck me forcibly that I have no idea what is going to happen in this match,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Robert Wilson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Several decades of watching this stuff is no help at all. We tend to neglect the joys of uncertainty (especially after we got our botties smack in the Eng v Ire match). Everything up for grabs. Only Test cricket does that so consistently (80s Windies and 90s Aussies notwithstanding). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolute delight. Like someone tripping over an unpublished Tolstoy joke-book or a forgotten Van Gogh watercolour of a basket of kittens.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I love the analogy, but what does that make, say, this game from 1992-93? Like finding a lost sequel to Plan 9 From Outer Space? Done him! That is splendid bowling from Scott Boland. Gill offered no stroke to a delivery that landed in exactly the same spot as all the others that he had safely left \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except this one jagged back to hit the top of off stump. In fact, it came back so far that it hit a bit of middle as well. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a huge wicket for Australia, and an ominous moment for both India and England. All those scare stories about Scott Boland in English conditions may be coming to pass. 6th over: India 30-1 (Gill 13, Pujara 0) The new batter is Cheteshwar Pujara, the quiet hero of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous victory in Australia in 2018-19. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already scored three centuries for Sussex this season. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Who,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd begins Leo in Sydney, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chooses the type of wicket in a neutral game?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I assume it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to the ICC, same as during a World Cup. Cummins digs one in to Gill, who cuffs it disdainfully over mid-on for four. Not many people plonk Cummins to long-on like that. Plenty of people get out LBW to him though, and Rohit Sharma has just joined the list! He played around a full, straight delivery that thudded impatiently into the front pad. Rohit discussed a review with Gill, who politely disabused him of the notion. That was plumb. 5th over: India 23-0 (Rohit 15, Gill 6) An early bowling change, with Scott Boland on for Mitchell Starc (2-0-14-0). All logic suggests Boland will bowl beautifully in England, though these aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t typical English conditions. He hits a length straight away, and Rohit is beaten when he carves outside off stump at the last delivery of the over. A maiden. 4th over: India 23-0 (Rohit 15, Gill 6) Gill is surprised by a bit of extra bounce from Cummins, though he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still gets on top of his defensive stroke. Just a leg-bye from a good over. 3rd over: India 22-0 (Rohit 15, Gill 6) Rohit pulls Starc towards deep backward square for a couple. He has taken on the short ball two or three times in this innings already. Starc beats Rohit with a good one, but then slips in a wide yorker that is squeezed through the cordon for four. India are off to a flyer. 2nd over: India 13-0 (Rohit 6, Gill 6) Shubman Gill has a modest Test record \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 15 Tests, average 34 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but he was in astonishing form in the recent IPL. He gets off the mark with the most beautiful extra cover drive for four off Pat Cummins. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a no-ball, too, and Gill squirts the extra delivery through the cordon for a couple more. 1st over: India 5-0 (Sharma 5, Gill 0) Rohit gets off the mark second ball with the smoothest of swivel-pulls for four. Nothing much else to report, mainly because I was busy changing the furniture on this article. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. The Australian players are back out on the field, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re about to find out what 469 is worth on this pitch. Mitchell Starc will open the bowling. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enough from me, Rob Smyth will take over for the rest of the day. 121.3 overs: Australia 469-10 (Boland 1) The not out player is Boland, who will now prepare to bowl first change. Mitchell Starc is already in the middle doing some warm-up bowling, only a minute or so after the final wicket fell. Cummins will join him shortly. It looks a substantial total given that the pitch was still offering decent bounce and carry, some erratic bounce on occasion, and it has some cracks starting to open up. Not that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a minefield but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give good bowlers something. Siraj finishes with 4 for 108, Shami 2 for 122, Thakur 2 for 83, and Jadeja 1 for 56. Umesh is the wicketless one, conceding 77. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the end of that. Cummins decides to take one on, slapping a length ball over cover, except that it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get over cover. Rahane is set quite deep and has time to get into position for the catch. The Australian captain didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t middle one in his fairly lengthy stay, but he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind much: 469 is fair old total. 121st over: Australia 469-9 (Cummins 9, Boland 1) None Shall Pass, says Aesop Rock ft. Scott Boland, as the Victorian blunts six Jadeja deliveries without moving from the crease. 120th over: Australia 469-9 (Cummins 9, Boland 1) Off the mark immediately is Scott Boland, tucking a ball through square leg to keep strike. Siraj gets the next one. Replacing Umesh at the Pavilion End, from wide on the crease, he angles one in and gets it to move further off the seam. Lyon aims a huge drive and is beaten on the inside edge to lose off stump. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one ball after Siraj gave away another four byes with a short ball after Lyon missed his hook. 119th over: Australia 463-8 (Cummins 8, Lyon 9) No run from a short Jadeja over, Lyon blocking out the lot. 118th over: Australia 463-8 (Cummins 8, Lyon 9) Up on his toes, Lyon, and punching Umesh out through extra cover for four! Effective shot. Three slips waiting behind him, plenty of gaps. Cover gets plugged. Umesh strikes pad but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going down leg. Lyon places a two and a one either side of the wicket. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already outscored Cummins. 117th over: Australia 456-8 (Cummins 8, Lyon 2) With that very open stance of his, Lyon tries to wrist Jadeja through the packed leg side field for one. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it. Pushes to point instead and gets off strike. Cummins has a deep cover point, long off, long on and deep backward square for any big shots, but deep midwicket is open. He simply defends a couple with a straight bat. 116th over: Australia 455-8 (Cummins 8, Lyon 1) Not sure you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see this batting pair hang around long. A couple of singles, Umesh still smashing that length. Then Cummins tries to swing one over the leg side, not short enough and he gets little of it. Rohit sends a deep square leg out. Umesh goes headhunting, but too high and Cummins goes down the elevator shaft easily. 115th over: Australia 453-8 (Cummins 7, Lyon 0) Spinner versus spinner, Jadeja to Nathan Lyon, who blocks the last two of the over. Jadeja comes on for a whirl, left-arm spin. Around the wicket to both the right-handed Cummins adn the left-handed Carey. Cummins is off strike immediately, a simple straight punch. Carey misses his first ball, past the outside edge, and after it hits the keeper he picks it up and hands it back. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be doing that, Alex. India don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appeal but they have the right to. Next ball, Carey launches it for six! Over wide long on, gets up and under it. And the next he goes down for a reverse sweep, plays over the top of it, and is hit on the back thigh. Fair enough that the standing umpire says not out: Carey might have gloved it, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a big stride forward, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not clear where it hit him. But India review, and the slow-mo shows it hitting him on the inside of the back thigh, down low, and no contact from bat or glove. 114th over: Australia 446-7 (Carey 42, Cummins 6) Down crouches Cummins, and blocks out an Umesh yorker. Off strike next ball with an edge past the stumps. Wonder if that was another low bounce one. Umesh spins at the top of his mark, gets onto Carey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pads, and some good T20 running sees Carey back for two as fine leg has to move inward and around to the ball placed squarer. Last ball of the over he is beaten again. Umesh is a new bowler today, and hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had any luck. 113th over: Australia 443-7 (Carey 40, Cummins 5) Shami from the Vauxhall End, tight on Carey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off stump as well. The view from here is right behind Shami\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arm when he bowls around the wicket. Carey glides, and places it fine enough to beat the deep backward point for four. Loves that shot. The next ball cuts back, nearly through him, into the thigh pad and could so easily have spun back onto the stumps. It misses, and Carey follows it with another boundary, picking off the attempted yorker that is a tad underpitched, sending it away behind square leg. Lovely timing. This is now a very useful score from Carey. And he garnishes it with four more, another flick of a full and straight ball, this time well in front of square to the other side of the futile sweeper. 112th over: Australia 431-7 (Carey 28, Cummins 5) Wonder if there was a decision made at lunch to go hard from here? Carey again thrashes at a couple and misses. Umesh is bowling much better than yesterday, a nice line tight to the stumps and a tough length, with good pace rushing through the shot as well. Sprints up with the pavilion at his back and lets the ball go, Carey dashes a single, Cummins watches one zip by his off stump. 111th over: Australia 430-7 (Carey 27, Cummins 5) Very nice shot from Cummins facing Shami, placing the flick through midwicket and coming back for three. The left-handed Carey plays a similar shot and hits it more sweetly for four. 110th over: Australia 422-7 (Carey 22, Cummins 2) Umesh Yadav to resume after lunch, and Carey starts in dicey fashion. Throws the bat a couple of times and makes no contact. One ball keeps low in there, too. The inconsistent bounce will interest Starc and Cummins greatly. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something for your lunchtime pondering. Steve Smith moved up a spot on another record list by making his 7th Test century in England. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the equal second most for a visiting player, behind Guess Who. It made me wonder which visiting players have the most in the other Test countries, so here are the answers. This list refers to hundreds in that country, not against that country. England Big Don Bradman 11 Steve Smith, Steve Waugh 7 Australia Jack Hobbs 9 Wally Hammond 7 Virat Kohli, Herbert Sutcliffe, Sachin Tendulkar 6 West Indies Sunil Gavaskar 7 Ricky Ponting 5 India Alastair Cook 5 Hashim Amla, Clive Lloyd, Everton Weekes 4 South Africa Tendulkar 5 Hammond, Neil Harvey 4 Sri Lanka Tendulkar 5 Bangladesh Tendulkar 5 Pakistan Mohinder Armanath, Aravinda da Silva 4 Zimbabwe Kallis, Marvan Atapattu 3 New Zealand Kallis, Weekes, Greg Chappell, Asanka Gurusinha, Desmond Haynes, Javed Miandad, Kumar Sangakkara, Alec Stewart, Graham Thorpe 3 Substantial progress for India in that session \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they got through Head and Smith without either overnight not out player adding a huge amount of damage, and they took out Green and Starc as well. But Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial foundation meant everyone was able to score at a decent rate, adding 95 runs for the session. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s total is likely already be too many for India \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though of course India might also come out and make 600. Three wickets in hand when Australia resume. 109th over: Australia 422-7 (Carey 22, Cummins 2) Some weird decisions from Rohit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bowling Umesh for one over before drinks wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite as odd, but asking Shami to warm up for one over before lunch seems like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in your bowler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best interests. Any rate. He bowls a no-ball and concedes a single to Carey, and that is sandwich time. 108th over: Australia 420-7 (Carey 21, Cummins 2) Siraj is planning his bouncer attack. Three in the deep on the leg side. Deep third, set quite fine. And Siraj goes with the bluff, trying the yorker, but misses his length and bowls it a touch wide. Carey is already backing away, and is able to deflect it behind point point for four. Then gets a short ball that he can bunt away to leg while mid hop, another run to the total. Two slips for Cummins, with a short leg as well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and Siraj bowls a horrible bouncer, way down leg, over the batter and past the keeper for four more extras. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 420 for Australia, blaze up. 107th over: Australia 410-7 (Carey 16, Cummins 2) Driving out to deep cover is Carey. He hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tried anything adventurous so far. Not long until the lunch break now, probably the plan is simply to bat India as deeply into the fifth session as possible. Cummins gets his first runs, placing Thakur through midwicket for two. 106th over: Australia 407-7 (Carey 15, Cummins 0) Siraj short to Carey, who plays a nice hook shot but only gets one run with deep square leg back. Siraj stays short to Cummins who evades comfortably enough. 105th over: Australia 406-7 (Carey 14, Cummins 0) Another sniff of a run out as Cummins turns a ball to midwicket and both batters set off, stutter, and go back as the throw comes in. Shardul bumps Cummins, perhaps getting in before Cummins can do the same, hitting him on the arm. Then strays down leg, allowing Cummins to add four to the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s score off his thigh pad. Technically though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a maiden over. 104th over: Australia 402-7 (Carey 14, Cummins 0) The captain joins his wicketkeeper in the middle. Carey on strike defends to end the over. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one! Starc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call, Starc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s error. He drives straight, not forcefully back past the bowler. Sees mid on moving to his left, knows he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to field left-handed. So Starc takes on the run. The only problem is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the sub fielder, Axar Patel, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s left-handed. So Axar picks up cleanly and throws down the stumps on the bounce, across his body. Good fielding. Carey honoured the call because he had his back to the ball and was running to the safer end. Fair enough. Starc goes, a metre short. 103rd over: Australia 400-6 (Carey 13, Starc 4) There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the 400 for Australia, with a couple of singles from Thakur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bowling. More wickets needed urgently for India, it looks like there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still enough in this surface to give Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bowlers a chance. 102nd over: Australia 398-6 (Carey 12, Starc 3) The ball is still doing a bit! Umesh gets one to swerve through the air, beating the keeper down the leg side to the fence. Whoops. Starc drives a couple of runs through cover. 101st over: Australia 391-6 (Carey 11, Starc 1) Similar pattern, Carey steers a single second ball of the over and leaves the business end to Starc. The tall bowler opens his account with a run to midwicket nudged off his pad. Carey adds another. They draw Australia closer to 400. 100th over: Australia 388-6 (Carey 9, Starc 0) Happy to take a single is Carey, turned to midwicket. Starc leaves one, wafts at another. Umesh got Starc out in his reversing spell of 3 for 12 in the first innings at Indore a couple of months ago, a performance that kept India in the game for a while after having been bowled out for 109. Starc survives this time. 99th over: Australia 387-6 (Carey 8, Starc 0) With that wicket under his belt, Shardul Thakur is suddenly into his stride. Bowls a good tight line at the body of the left-handed Starc, a bit of movement through the air even when the length isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t full. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen some fine spells from him over the past couple of years. Bowls a straightening line across Starc to follow that nearly draws a nick behind. India have clawed back into the contest in this session, they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to let the lower order get Australia up around 450 though. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the one! The Oval erupts as Smith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stumps light up. Shardul Thakur on for a trundle, and that must be close to the most harmless ball that has ever got Smith out. A warm-up ball, well outside the off stump, and for some reason Smith leaves his bat hanging out there, well away from his body. It takes the inside edge, and he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get the lucky runs that Carey enjoyed in the previous over. He just gets dismissed. 98th over: Australia 387-5 (Smith 121, Carey 8) Streaky from Carey, chops a shot off the inside edge past his stumps for four. Umesh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fruitless bowling innings continues. 97th over: Australia 382-5 (Smith 120, Carey 4) Off the mark with a boundary is Carey, opening the face and steering behind point. Shami is bowling around the wicket to him, two slips and a gully in place. Smashes him on the pad last ball of the over, going down the leg side I fancy. Control+C, Control+V, another big appeal from a backward-running Shami, and this time Rohit shapes to request the review\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Pulls his arms away from the T sign and walks straight to their drinks break huddle. 96th over: Australia 378-5 (Smith 120, Carey 0) Umesh Yadav on to bowl one over before drinks. Better than his start yesterday, it only yields a dashed single for Smith and a leg bye from Carey. 95th over: Australia 376-5 (Smith 119, Carey 0) Shami to the left-handed Carey, working in the channel outside off stump immediately. Smashed on the pad last ball of the over, but high, maybe some bat in there? Hard to tell, it bounced up towards point a long way. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one for India! Green looked good for a minute but he aims a hard-handed drive at a ball that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not full enough for it. Looking to force that more than drive it, not fully forward. Shami gets enough from the pitch to take the edge and it flies to first slip, nearly taking Gill with it to the boundary. He manages to cling on while he falls. 94th over: Australia 368-4 (Smith 119, Green 6) Siraj will be frustrated. Draws an edge from Smith, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thick and low, flying square through the finer part of the gully area for four. Siraj follows up by revisiting his early sins, full on the pads and Smith clips him for another boundary. 93rd over: Australia 368-4 (Smith 111, Green 6) So Travis Head\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career batting average is up to 47.62. The partnership was 285, which is 29th on Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all-time partnership list. 92nd over: Australia 367-4 (Smith 110, Green 6) Cameron Green to the middle for his first hit in England, and he smokes his first ball for four! Width, enough to smash a square drive behind point. Then takes two more through square. Comfortable start. Another bouncer goes way over the batter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head, again waved through by the umpire. There it is! Relief for India. Head isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a bunker-down-and-go-again kind of player, so he keeps throwing the bat at everything. This time it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a ball down the leg side as he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stepping across to off. Middling length, about hip high. Gets a glove on it to the keeper. 91st over: Australia 361-3 (Smith 110, Head 163) Shami tries the short ball from the far end, and Head whacks that for four. Then another pull to fine leg for a single. Pitches up at the end of the over and Smith drives that through cover for four! Hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t played much on the off side in this innings but he gets the width there to open his hands. 90th over: Australia 351-3 (Smith 106, Head 158) Suddenly some life from Siraj! Gets his length right with the short ball, savagely rising at head who fends it away desperately and gets lucky as it lands safely behind point. Two balls later, he miscues a pull shot into the leg side, landing in a gap between a couple of fielders. The ball in between those two, though, he pulls for four. Classic Travis Head sequence there. 89th over: Australia 345-3 (Smith 105, Head 153) The first boundary of the day for Head, leaning back and placing his cut shot behind point from Shami. He gives a modest wave and nothing more for the applause greeting his 150 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c quite right, Travis, it is a nonsense milestone. Get a double ton and salute that. He tries a similar shot next ball and gets one more run. Smith glances another. 88th over: Australia 338-3 (Smith 104, Head 148) Siraj works away, and after that early flurry Smith goes back into his defensive mode from yesterday. The only run is a wide from a high bouncer. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quicks really have not got the length on this pitch, most of the short balls yesterday went sailing over. And the umpires ignored most of those yesterday, but this one is called today. 87th over: Australia 338-3 (Smith 104, Head 148) Mohammed Shami on from the Vauxhall End, and hitting a decent length. Both players bat sensibly, with a couple of singles, until Head swishes at the last ball of the over and misses. 86th over: Australia 336-3 (Smith 103, Head 147) Well that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long! Travis Head rides the bounce of the first ball of the day, dropping it to the leg side for a run. Then Siraj bowls two offerings on the pads, and Smith flicks them both away through the leg side for four! He goes from 95 to 103 in the blink of an eye, and has no sooner started his day than he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lifting his arms to the crowd in salute, kissing the badge and all that stuff, celebrating Test century #31 in his personal collection. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one every 3.12 matches across his career. The players are in the middle, we are ready to go. Lovely day here at The Oval, the forecast was spot on so far. Not a cloud visible about quarter of an hour before play. Pleasant sunshine but not hot. If you want to come down there might be seats available in the Pavilion. They only got around to releasing those publicly a few days ago, given the Surrey members hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t shown much interest. So it was largely empty in that one stand yesterday. This being the ICC + cricket in England, those tickets are probably punishingly expensive if they are available. Let me know if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been scoping it out, enquiring minds want to know. Want to know about Travis Head reaching new heights before a lot of people have realised that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite that good? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got you covered. Want a wider lens on the whole shebang, the meaning, the spectacle, the annoyed public servants? Andy Bull is your answer. Want the details of yesterday? Have Simon Burnton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s match report. Gooood morning/morrow/gloaming/evensong, or whatever temporal variant applies to you. It is time for the World Test Championship final to enter its second phase, on a day that the Australians will be looking forward to rather more than what is probably a sore and irritable Indian team. India were in the game yesterday after some fierce bowling at the start, but then Travis Head did the Travis Head trick, which is to make a million runs at a million miles an hour. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resuming on 156 not out, Steve Smith on 95 not out, and they could race up the list of Australian partnerships with 251 already between them. Commentary statement of the obvious: India need all of the wickets in none of the time, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supposed to be a sunny day in London with temperatures in the low 20s. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right: officially a Batting Day. Prepare yourself."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/08/caroline-lucas-green-party-moderniser-made-parliament-listen", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Caroline Lucas: Green moderniser who made parliament listen", "lead": "As Green leader prepares to step down, she leaves behind a more established party that must continue to evolve without her", "author": "Kiran Stacey", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T17:23:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897122", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/30d07bd03e3697bba46ffe61d10ce57367e98701/726_0_4209_2526/500.jpg", "body": "One day in 1986, Caroline Lucas went looking for the Green party headquarters, finding them in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shoe box\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Clapham High Street in south London, and immediately signed up as a member. Thirty-seven years later, Lucas has announced she will stand down at the next election as the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only MP after decades as its highest-profile member. In that time she has been one of its MEPs, its only MP, and its leader on two occasions, and has spearheaded its core strategies of social and environmental justice to achieve some of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best ever election results. As she prepares to concentrate on her environmental work, Lucas leaves behind a bigger, more established and more professional party. She also leaves a parliament where the causes she has championed for years, from ending coal power to banning fracking, have been taken up by the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two biggest parties. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has been about putting things on the political agenda that would not have been there without me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says, hours after announcing her intention to stand down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153On coal power, on fracking, on drug policy, I have worked very hard to make these things issues for mainstream political debate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lucas, the child of two Conservative voters, was involved in a variety of progressive causes when she was younger, from women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rights to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She says Jonathon Porritt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book Seeing Green convinced her that these causes were all linked, with ecology and environmentalism at their core. After finishing the book, she immediately joined the Green party. Not long after, the party achieved its best ever election result, winning 15% of the vote and coming third in the 1989 European elections. That result, however, failed to translate into a single seat, thanks to the wide dispersal of Green support across the country. Over the subsequent two decades, as Lucas rose up the party ranks, she began to modernise the party and put it in a better position to win seats. The rotating \u00e2\u20ac\u0153speakers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who convened the party were replaced by a leader who had to be re-elected every two years and resources were put into places the party felt they could win. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amongst a lot of Greens, these sort of changes rang alarm bells, but in terms of modernising the party, making it fit for the 21st century and making it a mass membership party, they were essential,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Jonathan Bartley, who co-led the party with Lucas from 2016 to 2018. In 1999, Lucas was elected as one of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first two MEPs. Just over a decade later, she narrowly beat the Labour candidate to gain the seat of Brighton Pavilion. That victory, and each of her subsequent three election wins, have been built on the back of a strong local support base. Natalie Bennett, who succeeded Lucas as leader in 2012, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remember one time when we were door-knocking during the 2015 election campaign, a man stopped his car in the middle of the street, left his door open, rushed over to us and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcCaroline, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wonderful.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Then he got back in and drove off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But her biggest impact was in parliament, where for 13 years Lucas acted as a one-woman party, taking on every brief from foreign affairs to welfare policy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What really stuck out was that she had to cover every ministerial department as a frontbencher, and was keen to have in-depth discussions about every single issue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Matthew Butcher, who worked for Lucas in parliament and now works for the New Economy Organisers Network. Those who know Lucas describe her intense work ethic and long hours, often starting at 6am and working into the early hours. After more than a decade in power, Lucas says this has taken its toll. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have had 25 years of working crazy hours,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My staff and I would spend hours and hours making sure we understood every issue I had to vote on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For the past 13 years, Lucas has been either the actual or de facto leader of the Greens. Her party now faces the daunting task of achieving the same national prominence with far lesser-known candidates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This has been the Greens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 catch-22 for years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Bartley. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We knew we needed to bring forward more people in leadership roles, but so much of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success and political capital has been tied up in Caroline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tom Burke, a co-founder of the environmental thinktank E3G, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She has shown her party it can be done. If they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t keep doing it, it is not the public\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault, it is theirs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The party has just achieved its best ever local election result, winning 241 council seats and majority control of its first ever council in Suffolk. Members now hope they can use that strength in local politics to win more Westminster seats at next year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general election, even without Lucas as a candidate. But whatever the results of the election, even Lucas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political opponents admit she has helped propel her causes and her party into the centre of British politics. Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence party, says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it is very difficult for small parties to win seats under our outdated electoral system, there can be no doubt that both the Green party and Ukip have changed the national conversation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lucas says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My view is always to err on the side of being hopeful. The arguments have been made, and they are being listened to.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/08/cricket-australia-india-world-test-championship-final-day-two-match-report", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Australia take control of WTC final as India contribute to own downfall", "lead": "Australia reduced India to 151 for five, 318 runs behind, on the second day of the World Test Championship final", "author": "Simon Burnton at the Kia Oval", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T17:21:26Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897124", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/90f70adb2ea3ba8a4fe3dcac276dd41cc513d911/0_188_4699_2819/500.jpg", "body": "On a day of unbroken sunshine at the Oval India toiled in Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow. Ascendant at the end of day one, Pat Cummins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 side were resplendent at stumps on day two and, though Ravindra Jadeja and Ajinkya Rahane led something of a late fightback, India ended the day on 151 for five, still 318 behind. They will feel they contributed to their own downfall. There was some unexceptional bowling, occasionally downright wayward, as Australia reached a total of 469. Later Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara both fell to superlative deliveries, but they would have had a better chance of impeding their progress towards the stumps had they attempted to get their bats in the way. If this game is drawn the trophy is shared, which rather takes away the incentive for a side to take any risks once they fall behind in the contest. India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intention at the end of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innings must have been to slowly, carefully, find a foothold in the cliff face. Perhaps they picked up on the fervour of the crowd, who greeted every run as if the scorer had just won a lifetime achievement Bafta, but little about what progress they made at the start of their innings was calm or careful. The top four all fell having scored 13, 14 or 15, three of them when leaving or at least trying to. As captain, Rohit Sharma led the way, pinned lbw by Cummins. Gill followed in the next over, shouldering arms as a Scott Boland delivery swung towards middle and off. The delivery that did for Pujara was nearly identical, for all that it hit only one stump, Cameron Green finally claiming his first Indian Test wicket at the 389th attempt. Then Mitchell Starc got one to rear viciously into Virat Kohli and, as the batter tried to get out of the way, it flicked off his right thumb, extended out beyond the handle of his bat, and looped to Steve Smith at second slip. When, moments later, the logo of the Indian cola brand Thums Up (sic), an International Cricket Council partner, appeared on the Oval\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big screen, it seemed like a personal affront. Shortly afterwards, with the score on 87, Cummins had Rahane given lbw off what turned out to be a no-ball. It took Rahane more than an hour to score another run as he and Jadeja belatedly brought a measure of solidity to India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s innings, and from 71 for four they precisely doubled the score before Jadeja edged Nathan Lyon to slip. Australia had been on the front foot from the start, Smith hitting Mohammed Siraj\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second ball of the day for four to move to 99 and the next through midwicket to bring up his 31st century in 97 matches. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I started the morning I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have asked for more than two half-volleys on the pads to get me over the milestone,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Three overs later Travis Head cut Mohammed Shami for four to take his score beyond 150, and six overs into the day Australia had added 34 to their overnight score to reach 361 for three. Seven overs later it was 387 for six, as India belatedly and only temporarily saw fortune swing in their favour. Head fell for 163 off just 174 balls, victim as David Warner had been on Wednesday to an angled short ball that tempted him into a pull and clipped a glove. His partnership with Smith was worth 284 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Australians have only enjoyed five bigger in England, and three of those featured Don Bradman. Green lasted seven balls before a loose drive gave Gill a chance to take a fine catch at second slip. Smith misjudged Shardul Thakur\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first delivery of the day, little more than a loosener, and diverted it into his stumps having scored 121, taking his average in six Test innings at the Oval to a frightening 102.4. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought I applied myself nicely, left well on Wednesday morning, hit the balls in my area and was pretty solid in defence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously Trav batted beautifully and the way he took their bowlers on, hit them off their lengths, really helped me at the other end.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The dismissal of Starc seemed to confirm a shift in momentum. Shami, a right-hander, had briefly left the field and the left-handed Axar Patel replaced him at mid-off, and it was to his left side that Starc pushed the ball before calling for a single \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he had just played and missed twice, which might have added to his desperation to get off strike. Patel gathered it and released it in one fluid movement, and Starc watched it clatter into the stumps and just kept running, altering his angle slightly to change his course towards the dressing room. But India could not stem the scoring and after a slow start Alex Carey accelerated, hitting three boundaries in a single Shami over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one off the edge, to be fair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and biffing Jadeja over long-on for six. But during Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent Test series in India Carey repeatedly fell attempting reverse sweeps against spin and one ball later it was his undoing again here. Australia have not been perfect, but they are certainly pretty daunting."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/08/supreme-court-voting-rights-decision-allen-milligan", "primaryCategory": "law", "title": "Alabama discriminated against Black voters, US supreme court rules", "lead": "John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh join liberal justices in 5-4 decision that is major victory for Voting Rights Act", "author": "Sam Levine", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T16:52:55Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897136", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/1c4fca23083ee1c1f6fb6a7b03fa4ec051413324/0_5_5933_3560/500.jpg", "body": "Alabama discriminated against Black voters when it drew its seven congressional districts last year, the supreme court has ruled, a decision that is a major victory for the Voting Rights Act (VRA).

Writing for the majority of the court, Roberts noted the court was rejecting Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s effort to get it to rewrite its longstanding interpretation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.

As a young lawyer in the justice department in the 1980s, Roberts argued for narrowing the interpretation of section 2. The court has rarely sided with voting rights litigants who allege voting discrimination. The decision in the case, Allen v Milligan, means that Alabama will have to draw its congressional map to include a second majority-Black district. Black voters currently comprise a majority of the voting age population in just one district, despite making up a quarter of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision is a crucial win against the continued onslaught of attacks on voting rights,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Deuel Ross, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alabama attempted to rewrite federal law by saying race had no place in redistricting. But because of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sordid and well-documented history of racial discrimination, race must be used to remedy that past and ensure communities of color are not boxed out of the electoral process.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ruling also is a boon to similar cases in Louisiana, Texas and Georgia, where litigants currently are suing to require the drawing of additional majority-minority districts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This precedent also lays a foundation for fair map decisions in our other Section 2 cases,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Marina Jenkins, the executive director of the National Redistricting Foundation, a Democratic-aligned group that is involved in those cases. Alabama could have easily drawn a second majority-Black district, the challengers in the case argued. They offered several sample maps with possible configurations of how to do so. Last year, a three-judge panel unanimously agreed with that argument and ordered the state to do so. The panel, which included two judges appointed by Donald Trump, said the question of whether the state had violated the law was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a close one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Notably, the majority rejected an argument from Alabama that it should only be required to draw an additional majority-Black district if the plaintiffs could prove it was required without considering race. That theory would have made it extremely difficult for plaintiffs to show discrimination had occurred in redistricting against minority voters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This court has long recognized \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and as all members of this court today agree \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the text of \u00c2\u00a72 establishes an effects test, not an intent test,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kavanaugh wrote in a concurring opinion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The effects test, as applied by Gingles to redistricting, requires in certain circumstances that courts account for the race of voters so as to prevent the cracking or packing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whether intentional or not \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of large and geographically compact minority populations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Joe Biden praised the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision and said he and Vice-President Kamala Harris would continue to push Congress to restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. The US supreme court, in a 5-4 opinion authored by Roberts in 2013, gutted a key provision of the law that required states with a history of voting discrimination to get voting changes pre-cleared by the federal government before they went into effect. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The right to vote and have that vote counted is sacred and fundamental \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is the right from which all of our other rights spring. Key to that right is ensuring that voters pick their elected officials \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not the other way around,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the president said in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision confirms the basic principle that voting practices should not discriminate on account of race, but our work is not done.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Merrick Garland, the US attorney general, praised the decision in a statement. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision rejects efforts to further erode fundamental voting rights protections, and preserves the principle that in the United States, all eligible voters must be able to exercise their constitutional right to vote free from discrimination based on their race,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy, the right from which all other rights ultimately flow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined at various parts by fellow conservative justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. The supreme court has long misinterpreted section 2, he wrote, restating his prior view that it does not even apply to redistricting cases. He also wrote that the majority opinion required too much consideration of race in drawing district lines and urged a more race-neutral approach. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As applied here, the amended \u00c2\u00a72 thus falls on the wrong side of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe line between measures that remedy or prevent unconstitutional actions and measures that make a substantive change in the governing law\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thomas wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It replaces the constitutional right against intentionally discriminatory districting with an amorphous race-based right to a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 distribution of political power, a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcright\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 that cannot be implemented without requiring the very evils the constitution forbids.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alito, writing separately in dissent, also said that the plaintiffs advocating for an additional majority-minority district \u00e2\u20ac\u0153must show at the outset that such a district can be created without making race the predominant factor in its creation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision unnecessarily sets the VRA on a perilous and unfortunate path,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. The supreme court intervened in February 2022 on an emergency request and allowed Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maps to go into effect for the 2022 elections. Even though Alabama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election was not until the end of May, the court said it was too close to the election to upend the map. Alabama had argued that the lower court had wrongly decided the case by taking race too much into account. The challengers in the case should have been required to show that they could draw a second majority-Black district without considering race at all, Edmund LaCour, the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solicitor general, said during oral argument last year. The case was seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153textbook\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd example of the kind of discrimination in redistricting that section 2 of the Voting Rights Act was designed to prevent. The provision outlaws any voting practice that discriminates on the basis of race and litigants have frequently used it to challenge electoral maps that make it harder for minorities to elect the candidate of their choice. It was widely understood to be the most powerful remaining provision in the landmark civil rights law after the US supreme court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2013 decision in Shelby County v Holder. That decision blocked another part of the landmark civil rights law requiring states with a history of voting discrimination to get their changes approved by the federal government."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/08/matt-hancock-tells-court-he-felt-intimidated-by-anti-vaccination-protester", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Matt Hancock tells court he felt intimidated by anti-vaccination protester", "lead": "Geza Tarjanyi, 62, denies pushing former health secretary towards London underground escalator", "author": "Caroline Davies", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T16:43:29Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897139", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0c4d6b0cd2b391914d658dfb793ca211462fc912/0_113_1269_761/500.jpg", "body": "Matt Hancock felt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153physically intimidated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and feared being pushed down a London underground escalator by an anti-vaccination protester accusing him of murdering people during the coronavirus pandemic, the former health secretary has told a court. Geza Tarjanyi, 62, of Leyland, in Lancashire, who has denied causing harassment without violence, is accused of shoulder-barging the MP and shouting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ridiculous conspiracy theories\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on two separate occasions on 19 and 24 January this year. Hancock told a trial at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a public figure, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recall a time when I felt as intimidated as this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said the first occasion occurred as he and a member of his staff passed an anti-vaccination protest near parliament. Tarjanyi filmed him, asked why he had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153killed so many people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and shoulder-barged him during a five-minute interaction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I felt physically intimidated and felt like I needed to get to a place of safety. He was being completely unreasonable. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what further unreasonable actions he would take,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the MP, who was called as a witness, told the court. He added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It made me feel unsafe going about my place of work. It made me feel frustrated that instead of engaging in a normal debate, someone was trying to intimidate me. I thought that was unacceptable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had a pretty good impression he had been taken over by these ridiculous conspiracy theories.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A few days later, at about 8am, after Hancock had had breakfast with the prime minister, Tarjanyi followed the MP through Westminster tube station and on to a train for about 10 minutes, again accusing him of murdering people, the court heard. Hancock said he recognised the defendant and felt \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more intimidated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because he was on his own. He tried to get Transport for London (TfL) staff to intervene, he said. Tarjanyi then began harassing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153anybody who was going to come to my aid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and continued following him through the station. Hancock said he stopped at the top of an escalator to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resolve the situation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but felt the defendant pushing him towards it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obviously I was extremely worried at this time. If I had lost my balance at that point, I would have tumbled down the escalator. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long escalator, I could see a long escalator moving away from me, and I was being pushed from behind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He said he feared Tarjanyi was willing to commit a crime, alleging the defendant had told him he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wanted to go to court\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the reasons I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reported the incident on January 19 was because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want these people with these untrue beliefs to get further publicity from harassing me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tarjanyi then got on the Jubilee line train with Hancock and accused him of murdering \u00e2\u20ac\u0153millions of people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, before they were separated at Bond Street station. The defendant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mobile phone footage of the second incident, played to the court, showed him calling Hancock a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153murderous scumbag\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and saying lockdown amounted to the harassment of the country because of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lies and deceit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

She added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He denies assaulting him in any way shape or form.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She suggested Hancock had not been pushed during the incidents, arguing the defendant merely walked into him after he stopped.

A convoy of Israel Defence Forces (IDF) vehicles entered the city late on Wednesday night in order to demolish the home of a terrorism suspect who had been accused of planting two bombs targeting rush-hour commuters in Jerusalem last November that killed two people and injured another 21. At least six people were hospitalised overnight, three with gunshot wounds, Palestinian medical officials said, after hundreds of people gathered to protest against the army\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presence. The IDF said soldiers responded with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153riot dispersal means\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to young men throwing rocks. Moamen Sumreen, 22, a journalist covering the operation, was seriously wounded after being hit in the head by a rubber bullet, his family said. His uncle Mohammed Sumreen, also a journalist, told Agence-France Presse they had been part of a group of reporters and photographers watching events from the roof of a nearby building, and that Moamen had been wearing a jacket clearly marked \u00e2\u20ac\u0153press\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when he was fired at. The Israeli army said in a statement that the incident was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153under review\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Photographer Rabih Al-Munir was also injured by rubber-coated metal bullets that hit him in the abdomen, the Palestinian Press Syndicate said. The wounding of the journalists drew immediate parallels with last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high-profile killing of Al-Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. A May report from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) found that Israel had not charged or found any soldier accountable for the killings of 20 journalists, 18 of whom were Palestinian, since 2001. Court-approved house demolitions are a common tactic used by Israel, which says they deter Palestinians from resorting to violence, and are sometimes carried out in coordination with the semi-autonomous Palestinian Authority. Human rights groups have long maintained that they amount to collective punishment. The use of explosives to destroy the first floor apartment where 26-year-old suspect Aslam Faroukh lived before his arrest in December was unusual \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as was the location, Ramallah, a major Palestinian city in which Israel supposedly has no jurisdiction. The demolition went ahead after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an appeal to the supreme court against [it] was rejected\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the army said in a statement. Tensions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have soared over the last 18 months, leading to fears that a return to full-scale fighting is on the horizon: in 2023 so far, at least 156 Palestinians and 21 Israelis have been killed. November\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s twin explosions near a bus stop and a busy junction in the occupied eastern half of Jerusalem, both of which were detonated remotely, were the first bombings targeting Israeli civilians in the city in years. Faroukh was arrested in connection with the attack a month later. He is believed to have acted alone, and to identify with Islamic State, rather than Palestinian factions. Attacks on Israeli buses and public spaces, most of them carried out by suicide bombers, were a hallmark of the 2000-05 intifada, or Palestinian uprising, but have been rare since."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/21/war-pony-review-rousing-tale-of-love-and-money-on-a-native-american-reservation", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "War Pony review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rousing tale of love and money on a Native American reservation ", "lead": "The innate wisdom and instinct to survive of two teenage males is beautifully observed in actor-turned-director Riley Keough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s debut feature", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T16:38:41Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897145", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ae7afdddceac1bb9c0c89e36b21eb6aeab54324c/110_0_3261_1958/500.jpg", "body": "Actor Riley Keough establishes her film-making credentials with this terrific debut feature, co-directed with Gina Gammell. It is a movie set on and around the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota and is scripted by Gammell with Bill Reddy and Franklin Sioux Bob. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really heartfelt and absorbing story (with something of Chlo\u00c3\u00a9 Zhao\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Rider) about two young guys from the Oglala Lakota community, one about 12 or 13, the other 19 or 20. They are not known to each other, or at least not until the very end of the film. But the drama lets us see how much life experience they share, and how they could almost be the same boy at different times of life. LaDainian Crazy Thunder plays Matho, a young kid with an aggressive, abusive dad. He has a crush on a girl in his maths class at school and has a sweet and almost romantic reverence for a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s found about magic spells. But his relationship with his dad leads to disaster and he winds up living with a relative who deals in meth, and Matho \u00e2\u20ac\u201c already way older and more careworn than his years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c starts selling this at school, against his auntie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s express wishes. Meanwhile, Bill (Jojo Bapteise Whiting) is a cool young guy we see cruising around town in an old car, and taking prison phone calls from the mother of his first son \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she is jailed on account of some unexplained bail violation. His second baby mama is utterly indifferent to him but Bill, with that unreliable cheeky smile that he evidently believes is very charming, assures her that he still loves her. And she is, in spite of herself, rather taken by Bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest absurd scheme: he has bought a poodle called Beast. Co-caring for Beast will bring them and their son together, he says blithely, and he can sell Beast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s puppies for a lot of money. Yet just as things start looking up, in their goofy way, a dark shadow settles. Bill gets a job for a white turkey farmer and it turns out his main work is going to be driving the young Native American women with whom this man is having illicit sex back and forth from the reservation. As a Native American, his presence makes this arrangement more discreet; he is complicit in exploitation and Bill is not so stupid that he does not understand this. Bill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own friendship with this man and his unhappy wife, who are supposedly schooling him in the finer things of life such as wine, is due to turn very sour. The movie shows us that what Matho and Bill have in common is a certain flair for entrepreneurship and bargaining over money. They both have scenes where they haggle over prices. These moments come because they are survivors and (of course) would-be thrivers, and they are natural risk-takers. And for all that their background is tough, they are instinctively gallant in their own ways. When he hears the words of his new employer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there were no women in the world, money would have no meaning!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can see how Bill senses that there is something bizarrely crass in this supposed compliment, of which Bill would never be guilty.

The Devon port is one of several places along the south coast that have been examined by Home Office staff, according to Whitehall and maritime sources. In a further development, the mayor of Portland in Dorset, where Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government will site a first barge for asylum seekers later this month, has questioned if plans to restrict their movement are legal. Sunak announced at the weekend that two more giant vessels would be used to house about 1,000 people seeking asylum in the UK, but declined to say where. One is expected to be moored in Birkenhead near Liverpool. Sources said that the plan to place a vessel in Teesport, near Middlesbrough, had not been confirmed. Asylum seekers could be housed in vessels moored near Newcastle, Harwich in Essex and Felixstowe in Suffolk, the Guardian disclosed. Officials have examined the possibility of mooring a barge or a cruise ship near Plymouth and have been mulling over potential difficulties. A local maritime insider said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not impossible to put an accommodation barge in Plymouth, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to see where without interfering with vital port services and operations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carralyn Parkes, the Labour mayor of Portland, has lived on the Dorset island for 25 years. She said she had been told by Home Office staff that there would be tight restrictions on the movement of asylum seekers, and questioned if those restrictions would be within the UN refugee convention. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Each refugee who wishes to leave the compound will have to go through three checkpoints and will have to be accompanied by staff as they enter and exit the port. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is because it will still be a functioning commercial harbour and those people staying on the barge will have to keep within a limited area. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They cannot just get up and walk out of the front door as they could if they were in a community. It contravenes the sprit of the 1951 convention on refugees and its 1967 protocol,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she told the Guardian. A senior Home Office official told residents in Portland on Tuesday that the barge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Bibby Stockholm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was being refitted at a dry dock in Falmouth in Cornwall before being towed to Portland ready to house its first residents in the last week of June. The port owners are insisting the asylum seekers will be allowed to leave the port only by bus, which will take them to pre-arranged drop-off points including locations for activities and voluntary work. Dorset council, which is opposing the plans, had ruled out legal action after reviewing specialist legal advice, it said in a statement. Waleed Sheikh, a partner at the human rights law firm Leigh Day, said restricting the movement of asylum seekers may be open to a challenge in the courts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach of isolating and severely restricting the movement of people, many of whom will be vulnerable and whose only fault is to seek sanctuary in this country, is one-eyed and a show of utter indifference to their welfare. It is also potentially unlawful,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. The mayor of London on Thursday wrote to Suella Braverman outlining his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong opposition\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsafe and unworkable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd proposals to moor refugee accommodation close to London City airport. Sadiq Khan said in a statement that he had written to the home secretary to outline opposition to proposals to use London as the location of barges to accommodate those seeking asylum. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were recently approached by the Home Office asking to use the Royal Docks as a location for a barge. To be clear, these plans would be unsafe and unworkable, and they risk the health and wellbeing of already highly vulnerable people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Docks said it had informed the Home Office last month that the waters beside the airport would not be appropriate as a potential location. Scott Derben, the managing director of the Royal Docks Management Authority, told PA Media: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Royal Docks were approached by the Home Office to look at the feasibility of berthing a cruise ship to house asylum seekers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153After investigation, it was concluded that this would not be an appropriate use for the Royal Docks. The Home Office were informed of this decision in May.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Home Office spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The use of expensive hotels to house asylum seekers crossing the Channel is unacceptable, and must end. Alternative accommodation options, including barges, will save the British taxpayer money. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We will continue to meet our legal obligations and responsibilities to those being accommodated on the barge, as we do for asylum seekers living in other accommodation, subject to the safety requirements placed on all visitors to Portland port.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/08/uk-energy-bills-support-cost-treasury-winter", "primaryCategory": "money", "title": "Keeping UK energy bills down over winter cost almost \u00c2\u00a340bn, Treasury says", "lead": "Government publishes total of support to homes and businesses between October and March", "author": "Jillian Ambrose Energy correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T16:26:33Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897152", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/6fc085049c0dd4fa7e3a233ffc5fa650794e6b9e/0_111_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cost of keeping energy bills down for homes and businesses over the winter months added up to almost \u00c2\u00a340bn, the first official government total shows. The Treasury pegged the final cost of keeping a lid on the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy bills at \u00c2\u00a339.3bn between October 2022 and March 2023 after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine propelled energy market prices to record levels. The unprecedented jump in wholesale energy costs forced the government to make its biggest ever intervention on energy bills at a cost to the exchequer of about \u00c2\u00a32,500 every second since October, it said. Home energy bills had been on course to more than triple in the space of a year to reach an annual average of \u00c2\u00a34,300 in the first quarter. In response, the government spent \u00c2\u00a321bn to cap the average dual fuel bill at \u00c2\u00a32,500 through its energy price guarantee. It spent a further \u00c2\u00a312bn to give every household a \u00c2\u00a3400 rebate in order to reduce costs further. The National Audit Office (NAO) criticised the schemes for offering support to millions of households that were still able to afford their energy bills. The NAO had forecast that the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support plans would cost \u00c2\u00a369bn, but falling market prices have reduced the cost of the schemes. The Treasury also spent \u00c2\u00a35.5bn over the winter through its energy bill relief scheme, which provided a discount to businesses and public sector organisations such as schools and hospitals between October and March. The government has sharply curtailed its support as energy market prices have tumbled from their highs last year, but experts have warned that market prices could remain well above pre-pandemic levels until the end of the decade, keeping 6.5m households in fuel poverty. Household bills are now protected by a price cap set by the energy regulator, Ofgem, equivalent to \u00c2\u00a32,074 for the typical household\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual gas and electricity consumption from July, which is still double the rate before energy market prices began to climb. Ministers have replaced the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy price guarantee, and its one-off \u00c2\u00a3400 grants, with a series of payments targeted at the most vulnerable that include a \u00c2\u00a3900 payment for those on means-tested benefits, \u00c2\u00a3300 for pensioners and an extra \u00c2\u00a3150 for disabled people. However, about 1.7m households in severe fuel poverty are expected to miss out on the extra help because they are not registered to receive certain benefits, according to researchers at the University of York. These households are estimated to include 688,000 fuel-poor families with children. The business bills relief scheme has been replaced with a far less generous arrangement that has left thousands of small businesses fearing they may go bust before next winter. The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s other energy support schemes, including support for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153off grid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd households and businesses that use alternative fuels, came to almost \u00c2\u00a31bn over the last winter, according to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tally."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/08/canada-wildfires-air-quality-preparedness", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Canada battles hundreds of wildfires as smoke still chokes major cities", "lead": "Quebec minister described \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcunprecedented\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 situation amid warnings that country must be prepared in future", "author": "Leyland Cecco in Toronto", "datePublished": "2023-06-08T16:23:24Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-09 13:33:58.897155", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/721d8cc7291f6f588124fdffc22c24e5aa2327fd/0_302_4032_2419/500.jpg", "body": "Wildfire crews in Canada continue to battle hundreds of blazes across the country as air quality in major cities remains poor and other regions brace for intense heat. And as the country burns, experts warn Canada needs to do a better job of readying its communities in areas increasingly prone to destructive blazes. More than half of the 414 fires across the country are out of control, said the emergency preparedness minister, Bill Blair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the hottest and driest months still to come. Paul Kovacs, the executive director of the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction at Western University, said Canada was increasingly seeing two wildfire peaks: one in the late summer, and one in the spring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When the snow melts early in the spring, and hot, dry weather comes very early, you have this window of vulnerability,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spring fire is much more evident than it was 20 or 30 years ago. And while we might get a bit of quiet in the coming weeks as the green returns, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be on edge all over again soon after.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Weeks of late spring wildfires have broken records in many regions of Canada, including in Nova Scotia, where sprawling, destructive wildfires are rare. In Quebec, where more than 160 fires are burning and the smoke has pushed down into the United States prompting dozens of air quality warnings, the province\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier pleaded with residents to follow evacuation orders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t put your life in danger,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the premier, Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Legault. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we ask you to evacuate it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real risk.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the worst-hit areas, northern Quebec and the western Abitibi region, no rain is forecast in the coming days. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want us all to be realistic so that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see things through rose-coloured glasses,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Legault. Already more than 11,000 people have been displaced by the wildfires and a record 457,000 hectares have burned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the history of [the agency] \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nearly 50 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve surpassed the worst year on record,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Quebec\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural resources minister, Ma\u00c3\u00aft\u00c3\u00a9 Blanchette V\u00c3\u00a9zina, told reporters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a situation that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unprecedented.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Legault told reporters the province was working with France, the United States, Portugal, Spain and Mexico to get additional fire crews, adding he was hopeful the number of firefighters on the ground would jump from 520 to 1,200 in the coming weeks. The Canadian armed forces already have 150 members helping battle the fires, but the military commanders say requests from all over the country are putting a strain on resources. Even in regions where wildfire is a more common seasonal occurrence, records appear set to fall. British Columbia is struggling to contain the Donnie Creek wildfire, already more than 3,100 square kilometres in size and projected to keep growing. The blaze in north-eastern BC is the second largest ever recorded for the province. In Ontario, where the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital and surrounding communities have spent days under a thick haze of smoke, the premier, Doug Ford, has not yet called for a province-wide ban on campfires, despite more than 50 blazes in the province. During a legislative session in Toronto, he accused the New Democratic party leader, Marit Stiles, of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politicizing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the wildfires after she asked him why he was not linking the blazes to human-caused climate change. Ford instead said lightning and campfires were to blame. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They happen every single year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Ford\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural resources minister told reporters that climate change was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153real and happening\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. As the country grapples with historically high temperatures, prolonged periods of drought, officials have started speaking about more proactive measures. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In coming years, we will have to reflect seriously on how we can equip ourselves to deal with this new reality,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, told reporters on Wednesday, adding the government might create a federal disaster-response agency to better enable officials to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153predict, protect and act\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But Kovacs said the country already had a plan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just needed more money. In 2005, the federal government and provinces developed the Canadian Wildland Fire Strategy. At the time, they suggested C$2.32bn (US$1.74bn) was needed to better address wildfire risk. But, after 10 years, only C$1.47bn was spent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know what we need to do. We have a plan. We just need to fund it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Kovacs also says the recent fires highlight the need for a nationwide building code that reflects the growing risk of intense fires. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our infrastructure construction should be wildfire resilient and should be part of how we live as a nation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In addition to the conversation about more firefighters and how to organize them, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a need for how to live with fire, and in particular, how to build our buildings and take care of our buildings so that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re safe from fire.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/08/labour-tory-social-care-crisis-public-funds", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "Labour won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to instantly fix every Tory failure.

Its failings block more hospital beds with elderly patients who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be released because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nowhere for them to go. More people needing care find rising barriers of ever-higher criteria, leaving them with none. Quality is so appalling in some places that councils in England have spent \u00c2\u00a37.5bn since 2019 paying for care rated as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inadequate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the regulator. All this is laid out graphically in a report, Support Guaranteed, published today by the Fabian Society. Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow health secretary Wes Streeting and the trade union Unison commissioned the report to lay out a roadmap to a new National Care Service. This is the right time for Labour to explore radical policies, planning how to implement them, as centre-left thinktanks did in the run-up to 1997. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t commit the party to a policy, but it does the research and the thinking, ensuring it is ready for power. The report shows what good care should look like, the order and priorities for improvement and how to do it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when funding permits. The first, most urgent step is the one Keir Starmer recommitted to in his speech this week to the GMB conference, promising care workers would be the first to get a fair pay agreement, which Labour will roll out across all sectors: this will \u00e2\u20ac\u0153set a new floor, a higher floor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for wages. The failure to recruit and retain care workers is so acute there are 165,000 vacancies, a number that is growing by the month. The report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-author Andrew Harrop told me that many leave for higher pay as healthcare assistants in the NHS, with a chance for an upward career path \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so this report recommends a gradual alignment of employment terms between the two services. But consider this: the Health Foundation says it will cost an extra \u00c2\u00a36bn by 2030 to keep social care in its present sorry state, just to stand still without improvement. Beyond a fair pay agreement, for which councils need to be funded, Labour has yet to commit to spending on care, or any other desperately needed service. It has said it will double the number of people trained as doctors and nurses, using money from abolishing non-dom tax breaks, but no commitments have been made yet about everyday NHS funds, nor about schools (beyond the bonus from charging VAT on private schools), or councils or further education colleges or early years teaching and childcare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c let alone prisons, probation, courts, or everything else in a state of dire decrepitude and decline. Labour is right to resist the pressure to effectively produce a budget for an election that is perhaps 18 months away. It will wait to make most of its spending commitments until it has seen figures in the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 March budget. There will be an avalanche of attacks, such as this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accusing Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plans\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of requiring a 3p income tax rise. The attack is absurd as the items listed were not policy, but it was enough to prompt Starmer and his shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153read the riot act\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at a Commons meeting this week, with a letter to the shadow cabinet warning \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there will be no unfunded spending commitments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if something is not signed off, it is not policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The next election will be fought on Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea of fiscal responsibility: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is important that everyone appreciates the high level of scrutiny we are under. The test of being trusted with the public finances is not optional \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is essential.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Time and again Labour will be accused of profligacy, the shades of Jeremy Corbyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last-minute free broadband for all at the last election acting as a flashing warning of how easily a pleasing promise turns into a signal of wild spending. After Liz Truss, the test got harder, unfairly, as she borrowed to splurge on tax cuts for the well-off, while Labour has pledged to borrow only for green growth investment. The Fabian report\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10-year plan is inspiring, but until we see what money gets allocated in the manifesto, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a roadmap on a drawing board. It gives the recommendation from the Dilnot commission for capping costs at \u00c2\u00a386,000 quite a low priority, as improving care for those who get little or none is more pressing than spending money on easing the means test for the better off. (You could relax the means test and instead tax old people more, with pensioners paying national insurance on their income.) The serious crisis is not just about elderly people, but a lack of support for the fast-rising numbers of disabled adults aged 18 to 64 needing support, due to more babies surviving with disabilities. The choices that Labour faces will be almost unbearable, the expectations near-impossible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Starmer and Reeves will need to be ruthless. Great questions must be confronted, such as how you share out spending on old people and young people. Political pressure and power is always with older voters, with most clamour for the needs of the NHS and social care, largely for elderly people. Children are the silent voices, which is why spending on them, their early years, schooling, benefits, care and mental wellbeing has fallen back severely in the past decade. As the cliche goes, they are the future, and so we wait to see who will be the winners in the great shadow cabinet spending tug of war.

My polls are rubbish, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything about inflation, hospital waiting lists are up, you know the kind of thing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Biden: Not really.

First and foremost, I have been working on my five priorities. To halve inflation, grow the economy- Biden: Sure. But what have you actually been doing? Sunak: As I said, I have been working on my five priorities for the British people which I have promised to deliver on. Let me tell you what my five priorities are. They are the five priorities on which I want the British people to judge me- Biden: So, you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really been doing that much. Sunak: As I said, my five priorities- Biden: But what else? Sunak: Apart from my five priorities? Well, let me see \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m taking the Covid inquiry my government set up to court because it keeps asking for information that I want to keep secret. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just about to OK Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honours list. Biden: So a disgraced prime minister still gets to do the honours? Sunak: Sure. Biden: You Brits crack me up. What else shall we talk about? Sunak: How about a US-UK trade deal? Back in 2016 I and the Vote Leave team promised that an improved trade deal would be a Brexit bonus. Biden: No. Sunak: What do you mean, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? Biden: I mean it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not happening. There is no trade deal to be had any time soon.

Maybe in five or 10 years. If then. Sunak: OK. I get the message. But can we at least say that we agreed not to talk about a trade deal? Or maybe we could just sign something vague and meaningless. Biden: If you like \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Sunak: It would look good for my end-of-visit communique to the British media. Make it look like we had in fact talked about a trade deal a bit. Even though we haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. By the way, have I told you about my five priorities? Biden: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a lot of time, is there anything else you want to say? Sunak: There is. I want to talk about artificial intelligence. Biden: What about it? Sunak: That I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very worried about it. Apart from AI that is obviously beneficial. Did I mention my five priorities? Biden: Sounds like you could do with an AI upgrade yourself. Unless you really are a halfwit. But what are you suggesting? Sunak: Well, seeing as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a world leader in AI \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Biden: Since when? You had scarcely mentioned it until a few AI experts raised their concerns a few weeks ago.

Biden: You may have mentioned it before \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Sunak: So here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thing. Because I know more about AI than anyone else and also have a lot of spare time on my hands, I am proposing the UK takes a leading role in regulating the industry. Biden: But you know that since you left the EU, the UK is no longer a member of the US-EU council that regulates AI-related policies \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Sunak: Really? Never mind. What I mostly want is a PR exercise. We won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually regulate anything. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll just have a conference to talk about regulating AI. It will all be pointless as by the time anything happens, AI will have evolved to take over the world. So we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll all just meet a few times, have a nice jolly and then forget about it. But we need the US to come. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pay your air fares and hotels. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that without you no one else will come. So please say you will. Biden: If we must \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Sunak: Just a couple more things: Ukraine. Can we agree that we are both still committed? Biden: You didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to come to Washington for that\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Sunak: And, my green card \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Is there any chance it can be renewed? I might need it again in a year or so. Biden: Is that the time?

In December he will embark on his biggest tour of the UK and Ireland yet (accompanied by fellow hip-hop mainstays Cypress Hill and the Game) and to mark the announcement, he will join us to answer your questions about anything in his varied career, which you can post in the comments section below. Ice Cube, real name O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Shea Jackson Sr, started rapping in high school after being challenged to a battle by a friend during class. The interest stuck: aged 16, he banded with K-Dee and Sir Jinx in the rap trio CIA, who would cut their teeth performing at parties hosted by Dr Dre. By the following year, he had joined the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s group NWA and became a major creative force on critically acclaimed 1988 debut Straight Outta Compton. His lyrics, which explored the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153war on drugs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and anti-Black state violence, supercharged the popularity of gangsta rap and its legacy continues: Ice Cube was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame two decades later in 2016. A dispute over royalties cut his NWA stint short and he pursued a rampant solo career at the turn of the 1990s, releasing four albums in four years. 1992\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s The Predator sold more than 3m copies in the US and became the first album to ever debut at No 1 on both the R&amp;B/hip-hop and pop charts; its single It Was a Good Day, with its smooth Isley Brothers sample, is considered one of the greatest hip-hop songs of all time. He also branched into the film industry in 1991 and since his debut performance as Doughboy in Boyz N the Hood he has acted in nearly 40 films, including the Barbershop, Friday, Jump Street and Are We There Yet series. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worked as a director, soundtrack curator and voiceover artist and, in 2015, he co-produced the NWA biographical film Straight Outta Compton alongside his fellow members. His music continues, too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c last year, he released a collaborative album with Snoop Dogg, E-40 and Too Short as the supergroup Mt Westmore. Ahead of his return to the road, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re asking readers to submit their questions for the west coast trailblazer. Maybe you want to hear about his early days in NWA, or his later collaborations with David Bowie and Nine Inch Nails? Or perhaps you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re curious about his career in the film industry: what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it like recreating the west coast scene in real time for Boyz N the Hood, or having your son later play you in a biopic? Post them below by 2pm BST on Tuesday and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll answer as many as possible."}]
