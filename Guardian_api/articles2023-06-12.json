It hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, because the names had not been submitted to Holac. But it is assumed that, if they had been submitted, they would have been approved. The main problem seems to have been the prospect of byelections. The EU has dashed UK hopes of an early review of the Brexit trade deal saying is unlikely to re-open talks until 2026. European commission vice-president Maro\u00c5\u00a1 \u00c5\u00a0ef\u00c4\ufffdovi\u00c4\ufffd, who leads for the EU on Brexit matters, said the deal was only in force for two years and it would be pointless re-opening it until its full potential was realised. The trade and cooperation agreement (the official title of the EU-UK free trade deal) says its implication can be reviewed from 2025, which had led to speculation a review might happen soon after the next general election. \u00c5\u00a0ef\u00c4\ufffdovi\u00c4\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarks come just weeks after Keir Starmer said Labour would seek an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153improved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd trade deal after Vauxhall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parent company warned it might have to quit the UK unless part of the pact was tweaked. The House of Lords urged the UK government to start working with EU capitals to remove Brexit barriers that block musicians, young people and professionals working easily in Europe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have received quite a lot of questions and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen that there is increased interest in the TCA review. As far as our calendar goes, I think that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more for 2026,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00c5\u00a0ef\u00c4\ufffdovi\u00c4\ufffd told the EU-UK forum. And he warned that wholesale stripping out of decades of EU law risks putting the trade deal in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the shredder\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd creating more obstacles to cross-Channel trade not fewer. He said: If the decision is just to simply go for more divergence \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 some of the fundamentals of the withdrawal agreement and the TCA would be thrown into the shredder. An ally of Boris Johnson has accused Rishi Sunak of having \u00e2\u20ac\u0153secretly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd blocked peerages for Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies, PA Media reports. Responding to Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments this morning (see 9.53am), the ally told PA: Rishi secretly blocked the peerages for Nadine and others. He refused to ask for them to undergo basic checks that could have taken only a few weeks or even days. That is how he kept them off the list \u00e2\u20ac\u201c without telling Boris Johnson. And here is some comment from journalists on Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s condemnation of Boris Johnson. From Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Powell From the former Times political editor Philip Webster From Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tamara Cohen Keiran Pedley from Ipsos says Rishi Sunak is in a strong position to slap down Boris Johnson, because even people who voted Tory in 2019 think he would be a better PM than Johnson. In his morning interview round, speaking on behalf of the government, Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, adopted a relatively non-confrontational approach when discussing Boris Johnson. While suggesting it was now time for the Conservative party to move on from Johnson, he avoided multiple opportunities to criticise him directly. (See 9.19am.) In his London Tech Week Q&amp;A, Rishi Sunak went much further, accusing Johnson of trying to do something improper with the honours list. By the standard of what some people say about Johnson, the words may seem almost anodyne. (See 9.53am.) But for Sunak, this was strong stuff. Until now, he has been reluctant to say anything very critical of Johnson in public, conscious that for a significant minority of Tory party members (but a much smaller cohort of Tory MPs), Johnson remains an idol, and a potential saviour. Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comment also provides the first on-the-record confirmation as to what the Sunak/Johnson rift over the honours list was all about. Johnson wanted to offer peerages to three MPs particularly close to him: Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary and his most loyal public defender; Nigel Adams, the former minister who was Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s key backroom fixer; and Alok Sharma, who worked as a junior minister for Johnson when Johnson was foreign secretary and who then chaired the Cop26 conference. (A fourth MP, Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary and a close friend of Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, was originally on the list too, but ruled himself out.) But it would not have been possible for the MPs to be named as peers on the resignation honours list but delay taking their seats in the Lords until around time time of the elections, to avoid byelections that would be damaging for the party. A minister confirmed this in the House of Lords in November last year. Today Sunak confirmed that Johnson wanted him to either over-ruled Holac on this issue, or to give a private assurance that if Dorries, Adams and Sharma were left off the list, they would get a peerage later. (A PM can nominate peers whenever they want.) That is why Dorries and Adams resigned out of pique. (Sharma has not resigned, and while it is hard to see Sunak giving peerages to Dorries or Adams, it is quite possible Sharma could get a peerage from Sunak in the dissolution honours, because his handling of Cop26 was widely admired.) But what remains unexplained is why Dorries, and perhaps Adams too, only realised that their hopes of going to the Lords were dashed at the end of last week. On Friday morning Dorries said that she would not be resigning as an MP. When she did resign a few hours later, she said it was because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153something significant happened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, implying she had only just realised that Sunak was not promising her a peerage. Yet Sunak and Johnson met to discuss this seven days earlier. According to Tim Shipman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s account in the Sunday Times, Johnson told Dorries afterwards that her peerage was safe. Shipman says: After the meeting with Sunak, Johnson messaged Nadine Dorries to say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just finished the meeting with Rishi. List being published imminently. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When it finally dropped on Friday, it was shorn of peerages for Dorries, Adams and Sharma, as well as gongs for two Tory donors, David Ross and Stuart Marks. One explanation would be Sunak not being clear to Johnson at the meeting about his intentions. But in his report Shipman also says a Sunak aide took notes during the meeting, and those notes record Sunak telling Johnson: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want you to leave this room thinking I have made you a promise as that will be a problem in our relationship going forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The alternative explanation would be that Johnson told him something about the outcome of his meeting with Sunak that was not true, and that Dorries only found out on Friday afternoon. If so, she would not be the first person let down by a Johnson promise. UPDATE: I have amended the post to take out a line wrongly saying that Holac had approved Dorries, Adams and Sharma for peerages. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t; they were not on the list of approved peers released by No 10 over the weekend. But it had been assumed that, had their names been submitted, they would have been approved. Their names were held back because if they had accepted peerages, that would have required byelections. Here is the full quote from Rishi Sunak in his Q&amp;A on Boris Johnson and his honours list. When it comes to honours and Boris Johnson, Boris Johnson asked me to do something that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to do, because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was right. That was to either overrule the Holac [House of Lords appointments] committee or to make promises to people. Now, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to do that. As I said, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was right. And if people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that, then tough. At that point there was a large round of applause. Sunak went on: When I got this job, I said I was going to do things differently because I wanted to change politics. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing. And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m also keen to make sure that we change how our country works. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m here talking about today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c making sure that we can grow our economy, that we can maintain our leadership in the innovative industries of the future. Why? Because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to create jobs for people, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to spread opportunity around. And it has the potential, as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been discussing, to transform people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives. As prime minister, I want to make sure that that happens, because I want to make sure that I improve everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lives in this country and do it in a way that is right and is in accordance with my values. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to keep doing. There was another round of applause when he ended. At the London Tech Week event Rishi Sunak is now taking questions from journalists. Asked about Boris Johnson, he says Johnson asked him to do something that he was not prepared to do, because he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He says Johnson wanted him to either over-rule the House of Lords appointments committee, or to make promises (to the MPs offered peerages by Johnson, who wanted to delay their resignations until later, so as not to cause byelections). This is the first on-the-record explanation we have had from Sunak about the rift with Johnson over the honours list. There is a round of applause for Sunak when he says this. (This is highly unusual in a Q&amp;A like this.) UPDATE: See 9.53am for the full quote. Sunak is now taking questions at the London Tech Week. He is in a Q&amp;A with Demis Hassabis from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DeepMind. He says the UK was at the forefront of inventions during the industrial revolution. Going forward, he says regulation is key; you need a balance between regulation that supports innovation but also puts appropriate protections in place. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK has a track record of getting that balance right,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. And he says creative industries will be an important component of tech in the future. He says that is another areas where the UK is strong. This is from Sky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rob Powell. Rishi Sunak is speaking at London Tech Week. In his opening remarks, he said the tech world was changing very quickly, and that the government could not afford to rest if it wanted to exploit the opportunities available. The UK was the third country in the world for unicorns (tech start-ups worth $1bn), he said. It was third in the world behind the US and China. Sunak also said the UK was the best country in the Europe for raising capital for tech. He went on: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the single most important reason innovators like you should choose this country? The answer is leadership. Do you trust the people in charge to really get what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to do With this government, and with me as your prime minister, you can judge us not by our words, but our actions. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this government that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building the most pro-investment tax regime, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing public R&amp;D investment to record levels, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s making our visa system for international talent one of the most competitive in the world, but overhauling our listing rules to make it easier for companies to raise public funding and changing our pension rules to unlock new private capital. Sunak said AI offered great opportunities. But it had to be developed in a way that was safe, he said, and he highlighted three government initiatives to achieve this. First, he said the government was working with companies to ensure they give early access to their models, so they can be evaluated. Second, the UK will host an international conference on AI regulation, he said. And, third, he said the government was investing in AI to ensure that it could be used to benefit public services. Good morning. At the end of last week Boris Johnson, and two of his most loyal supporters, resigned their Commons seats, unexpectedly and without any need to do so, triggering byelections that could destabilise Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams offered no proper explanation for what they were doing, and Johnson (wrongly) claimed that he was being forced out because the privileges committee is due to publish a report saying he misled parliament. (He could have stayed in the Commons to defend himself, and only losing a recall election would have forced him out for good.) Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation statement attacked the privileges committee, but the three resignations were also an implicit declaration of war against Sunak by a former PM whose only hope of returning to the political frontline rests on Sunak losing the next election. In this situation, what does Sunak do? Go on the offensive and seek to marginalise Johnson even more? Or calm things down, avoid antagonising the Johnson faction even further, and hope that mainstream party opinion will unite behind the leadership. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, has been giving interviews on behalf of the government this morning, and he made it clear that No 10 is adopting the latter strategy. Here are some of his messages. Gove defended the Commons privileges committee, and condemned the fact that criticism of the committee means that its members have now been offered extra security. He told the Today programme: The people who served on that committee were asked by the House of Commons collectively to do a particular job. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a job that has required careful work on their part and no little effort to make a series of significant judgments. So I have respect for the work that they have done. And I think that we need to respect again the integrity of the process, and wait until the report is published before then debating its conclusions and the consequences. The second thing that I want to say is that I do deprecate the fact that they are now in a position where, as reported, they have to seek or have been granted additional security. As someone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been through that position myself in the past then I extend my sympathy to them and their families at this point. Gove did not explain why the MPs on the committee feel they are under threat. It is because Johnson has accused it of acting like a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kangaroo court\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and suggested that it is ruling against him as part of some shadowy establishment plot to undermine Brexit, and because some Tory MPs, notably Jacob Rees-Mogg, have said much the same. The committee is meeting this morning to finalise its report into Johnson. Gove played down the significance of the three byelections, saying the party would unite behind Sunak. He told BBC Breakfast: Elections are part of political life. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the case I think that you do best in elections when you concentrate on good government. And we are united behind Rishi Sunak in making sure that we demonstrate that the priorities that the British public have are those which govern every waking moment that we have. Gove declined to criticise Johnson, Dorries or Adams explicitly. Asked repeatedly on the Today programme to acknowledge Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faults, he said he preferred to remember his achievements, and in another interview he refused to criticise Dorries or Adams for standing down. Gove dodged questions about whether he would like to see Johnson return to the Commons in the future, telling Times Radio: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve offered Boris advice in the past. He hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always taken it. And so therefore, I think Boris will make his own mind up. Some Tories want Sunak to declare that Johnson cannot stand again as a candidate, while Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters are saying blocking him would be unacceptable. It is not surprising that No 10 currently seems to be sitting on the fence on this one. We should hear from Sunak on the topic of Johnson soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Rishi Sunak gives a speech on AI at the London Tech Week conference. Morning: The Commons privileges committee meets in private to discuss the final version of its report on claims Boris Johnson misled MPs about Partygate. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby conference. After 3.30pm: MPs debate Lords amendments to the retained EU law (revocation and reform) bill. Later there will be a debate on Public Order Act regulations, followed by a general debate on the principle of excluding MPs from the parliamentary estate if they are deemed a risk to staff because of accusations they face. 4pm: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee on the integrated review. Also, Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, will be campaigning today in Mid Bedfordshire, ahead of the byelection caused by the resignation of Nadine Dorries.

A fascinating interview with Mitchell Starc by Andy Bull \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a modern cricket cut from a different cloth. The grass was brittle-dry at Southport, a hot-fire outfield begging for quick runs. And it was Lancashire who made the most of the conditions, first bowling Hampshire out for 142, with three wickets each for Will Williams and Tom Bailey, and then letting fly with the bat. Phil Salt, opening the innings for Lancashire for the first time in red-ball cricket, eyed up the Championship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best attack and advanced. He was dropped on four in the first over, off the hard working Keith Barker, and then pounced, combining flamb\u00c3\u00a9ed attack with, as stumps approached, watchful defence. Lancs finished the day just three runs behind, with the loss of only George Balderson, to the approval of more than 1500 spectators in fold-up chairs and sunhats. At Canterbury, Jordan Cox turned Kent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day upside-down with a sparkling century, transforming a miserable 41 for five into a respectable 301 all out. Wes Agar then took two early Surrey wickets to further twist the tale. Sam Billings was left out of the Kent side after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mutual discussions about form.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alastair Cook, an old-fashioned knight in a sudden surfeit, reached his 74th first-class century accompanied by heat and a welcoming Chelmsford pitch. He was joined in the three-figures club by Matt Critchley, whose gung-ho hundred wearied the Somerset attack. New Taunton signing Shoaib Bashir, a 19-year-old off-spinner, was put through his paces, fizzing down 29 overs. Yorkshire, winless in the first tranche of Championship cricket, had a good day. Perhaps buoyed by their T20 Blast successes, they filleted Derbyshire for 111, Matt Fisher picking up a career-best five for 30, Ben Coad three for 28. By the close, Yorkshire were already 161 ahead, with five wickets in hand. Shan Masood collected his highest score of the season, Dawid Malan unbeaten on 76. Elsewhere, Sussex fought back against Worcestershire, rain again haunted Gloucestershire, and a century from Sam Hain put Warwickshire in a strong position against Nottinghamshire. Kiran Carlson conjured up another bewitching century, his fourth of the season, as Glamorgan were all out just a sneeze short of 400 at Durham.

The survey, from BritishAmerican Business, the transatlantic trade association, and management consultancy Bain &amp; Company, found: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6A continuing toll from Brexit on American business sentiment towards the UK is aggravated by US firms\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 anxieties over political stability, economic growth prospects and corporate tax. On the Index\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1 to 10 scale, the average business confidence rating for the UK dropped by almost a full point, to 6.5 for 2023 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is nearly double the half-point decline to 7.3 in 2022\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results. Following the signing of the Windsor Framework agreement between the UK and EU in March, survey respondents acknowledged improvements in the UK-EU relationship. Confidence in this measure rose to 5.6 this year, up from 5.1 in 2021. Jonathan Frick, partner at Bain &amp; Company in London, said the transatlantic economic relationship and wider UK-US partnership are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153crucial anchors for the security and prosperity of both nations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heartening to see the continuing vitality of the relationship between Britain and America, our findings also show important challenges, on both sides of the Atlantic, but especially in respect of US investors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 confidence in the UK. These are a call to action for both governments as well as businesses in the two countries to work together proactively to further strengthen our transatlantic ties.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In the financial markets, the pound has hit a one-month high against the US dollar today. Sterling has been lifted by hopes that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economy will avoid a recession, and expectations that interest rates will keep rising for longer in the UK than the US. The pound hit $1.2595 this morning, the highest since 11 May, taking some support from Jonathan Haskel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warning that future rate rises can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be ruled out. The CBI has revised up its growth forecasts for the UK this year, from a 0.4% decline to show growth of 0.4% this year. But, the CBI adds that 2023 will be challenging for households and businesses. For the first time since the recession of the early 1980s, it expects real household incomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a measure of living standards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to fall for two successive years. 2023 will remain challenging for the CBI too, despite the embattled lobby group winning a crucial confidence vote last week. Bloomberg reports that the CBI has been abandoned by major sponsors of its annual conference, saying: Recruitment specialist Hays Plc sponsored the conference for about a decade but has since quit the CBI and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take part this year, a spokesperson said. The other leading sponsor, Accenture Plc, terminated its membership in April. Rishi Sunak may have wanted to talk tech today, as he spoke warmly of the entreprenurial attitude in California today, and the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pioneering role in the Industrial Revolution. Asked about how to grow UK tech, Sunak says: Fundamentally it requires entrepreneurs to just keep going, to be not content with building the \u00c2\u00a3100 million business and then the \u00c2\u00a31 billion business but just to keep growing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That, I found in California, is very much the attitude, the sky is the limit. Everyone thinks they can create a 100 billion-dollar company and actually changing that culture is tough for government to do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He also cited his push to make everyone learn maths until the age of 18 (despite criticism of the plan), saying the UK is currently an outlier on this issue. But he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t avoid the current political turmoil. He was asked at London Tech Week about former PM Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation honours list, published hours before Johnson stropped out of parliament after receiving the privileges committee findings into the Partygate scandal. Sunak says that he refused a request from his predecessor to intervene, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boris Johnson asked me to do something that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to do, because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was right. That request was either to overrule the House of Lords Appointments Commission (which did not support eight of Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nominations for peerages) or to make promises to people, Sunak says, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared to do that because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it was right, and if people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like that, then tough.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This wins some clapping, with Sunak adding: When I got this job, I said I was going to do things differently because I wanted to change politics, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m doing. Our Politics Live blog has more details: Asked about the opportunities of AI, Sunak suggests it could allow a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpersonalised tutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for students, and also reduce teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 workload, and help with marking and lesson planning. Rishi Sunak then tells an anecdote about how he recently saw a letter from Charles Babbage, the inventor, from the 1830s thanking the then-chancellor for funding his Difference Engine. That letter, in a British Library collection, showed that the government broke with convention by funding this cutting-edge idea, Sunak says. That was a decisive moment. The British government broke with the conventions of the time, and for a decade backed this breakthrough technology. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s determined that future researchers in 200 years will find evidence that the current government, and the tech sector, met the current opportunities with the same \u00e2\u20ac\u0153courage, vision and determination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Babbage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest project, the Difference Engine no. 1, was a machine intended to save the government money by preventing critical errors in tables calculated and copied by hand. Effectively it would have worked as a calculator. However, the story doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a happy ending, as the Whipple Museum reminds us. Funding was officially cut off in 1842 at which time he [Babbage] had spent over \u00c2\u00a317,000, ten times as much as originally intended. Somewhat embarrassingly, the British government purchased a difference engine based on Babbage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original design made by Swedes Georg and Edvard Schuetz, which they demonstrated at the World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fair in 1855. Difference Engine no. 1 remained unfinished in Babbage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lifetime, as he moved onto an even more challenging idea, the Analytical Engine, which actually included its own memory. Sunak then announces the launch of HSBC Innovation Banking, following the rescue of tech-focused lender Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year. This new unit will focus on banking services to the startup, investor, and wider tech community. On AI, Sunak then pledges to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lead\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the issue at home, where the government is working with artificial intelligence firms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and abroad, by hosting a global AI summit later this year (which he compares to the COP summits on climate change). Prime minister Rishi Sunak is speaking at London Tech Week now. Sunak says we are at at \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moment of huge opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153technonic plates of technology\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are shifting (he cites AI, quantum computing, synthetic biology and semiconductors\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We must act, and act quickly, if we want not only to retain our position as one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech capitals, but to go even further and make this the best place in the world to start, grow and invest in tech businesses. Sunak says he feels a sense of urgency about this, as it can help grow the economy. He then suggests that artificial intelligence could surpass industrial revolution in the speed and breadth of the changes it will bring, as he pitches the UK as the home of artificial intelligence (AI) regulation (see earlier post). He then pitches the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leadership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as an asset when trying to attract tech investment (after a weekend where his government came under pressure following the resignation of Boris Johnson, and two other MPs). Sunak says: Do you trust the people in charge to really get what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to do. With this government and with me as your prime minister, you can. In the travel sector, the boss of Heathrow has pledged that strikes by security guards at Heathrow are unlikely to cause flight cancellations. More than 2,000 members of the Unite union will walk out for 31 days from June 24 in a dispute over pay. For the first time, security officers based at Terminal 3 will join their colleagues from Terminal 5 and campus security who have already taken industrial action. Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye said that having kept running through earlier strikes over Easter, the airport is well-prepared. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have delivered excellent service to passengers, with no cancellations, over eight days of strikes on the busiest days in May, and do not anticipate cancellations as a result of strikes during the summer holiday getaway.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last week, Mr Holland-Kaye urged Unite to put the airport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest proposal of a 10% pay increase and \u00c2\u00a31,150 lump sum to a vote of its members. He claimed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know that most of our colleagues would accept the offer that we have on the table\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rishi Sunak will tell technology leaders he wants to make the UK both the intellectual and the geographical home of artificial intelligence (AI) regulation. In a speech to open London Tech Week on Monday, the Prime Minister is set to say that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd possibility of AI advances must be carried out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153safely\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as he positions Britain as a potential home of a global regulator. It comes after the Conservative Party leader used a trip to the US last week to announce that the UK will host the first global summit on AI safety. The Prime Minister, in pre-briefed comments ahead of his appearance at the 10th London Tech Week, will say: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Already we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen AI help the paralysed to walk and discover superbug-killing antibiotics \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the beginning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The possibilities are extraordinary. But we must \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and we will \u00e2\u20ac\u201d do it safely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want to make the UK not just the intellectual home, but the geographical home of global AI safety regulation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Interest in AI across politics has soared (as in the financial markets), as fears grow that the technology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapid advancement could spin out of control. The UK government hope to persuade other countries to use the UK as a base for a new global AI regulator, but experts have warned that success is unlikely\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Sticky UK wage growth means no rate cuts for the Bank of England until this time next year, analysts at ING have predicted this morning. In a new research note, ING say that last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshock inflation reading\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of 8.7% sent Bank of England expectations soaring. ING believe that the UK could be closer to the peak in interest rates than markets are assuming [the City is anticipating four more rate hikes from 4.5% to 5.5%]. They say: A 25bp rate hike in June could easily be the last \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if not, in August \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it will depend on how many more CPI [inflation] surprises we get through the summer. But, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153slow downtrend in wage growth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd suggests that rate cuts are unlikely to be a story for this year. ING adds: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve pencilled in the first cut for around this time next year, though eventually, we do expect a series of rate cuts that take Bank Rate down to the 3% area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some distance further than markets are currently pricing. Homeowners are being hit with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tory mortgage penalty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of \u00c2\u00a37,000 per year, with interest rates triple what they were two years ago, the Labour party have warned. Analysis by Labour suggests the average homeowner is forking out an extra \u00c2\u00a3150 every week since what officials called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kamikaze mini-Budget\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the autumn. It means the average household with a mortgage now pays \u00c2\u00a3223 a week in mortgage interest payments \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an increase of \u00c2\u00a37,000 per year, party officials said. Labour said those with a 75% loan to value (LTV) ratio mortgage faced average interest rates of up to 4.63% in April. The same deal had an interest rate of 1.49% in April 2021, said the party \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a third of what it increased to 24 months later. Pat McFadden, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, has blamed what he called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reckless economic gamble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd taken by the Conservatives during September\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mini-Budget. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This Tory mortgage penalty has increased the cost of home ownership by thousands of pounds a year, causing huge worry for families, while putting the prospect of owning a home further out of reach for many others. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rishi Sunak might want to forget the economic misery the Conservatives have inflicted, but the public can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget about it as their outgoings soar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour will make our economy stronger and more secure, and stop working people paying the price for 13 years of Tory failure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Economists at KPMG are also warning that UK interest rates will continue to rise this year, due to stubborn inflation. Their latest economic forecasts, released this morning, show a brighter growth picture -but high inflation for longer than hoped. KPMG say: Given the latest surveys, we no longer expect a recession in the UK, but growth is forecast to remain sluggish by historical standards. Inflation is on the way down, but the pace of moderation is slower than we previously thought. This will likely necessitate further interest rate increases and more pain to come for borrowers. The upside revision to our forecast means no plain sailing. Risks remain skewed to the downside, with ongoing fragilities potentially yet to be fully uncovered. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a slightly stronger momentum for the UK economy but risks are still elevated on the downside. A stickier inflation will see monetary policy tightening even further, increasing the risk of unwelcome side effects among other potential headwinds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. UK borrowers face further interest rate hikes this year as the fight against inflation continues. A Bank of England policymaker is warning this morning that the UK central bank may need to make \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further increases\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to borrowing costs as it tries to ease the cost of living crisis. Jonathan Haskel, a member of the Bank\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Monetary Policy Committee, suggests that more than one increase in interest rates may be needed. Writing in The Scotsman today, Haskel says the BoE mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow inflation to become \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcembedded\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the economy, saying: We are monitoring indicators of inflation momentum and persistence closely. My own view is that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important we continue to lean against the risks of inflation momentum, and therefore that further increases in interest rates cannot be ruled out. As difficult as our current circumstances are, embedded inflation would be worse. Expectations of higher interest rates has caused turbulence in the mortgage market in recent weeks. Ian Stuart, CEO of HSBC UK Bank, told Radio 4\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Today programme that inflation is looking sticky, and probably won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fall \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quite as fast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as hoped. That means that borrowing costs are unlikely to start falling again soon. Stuart explains: Well, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a crystal ball. But\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. inflation is not falling as quickly as a lot of people have predicted. So as long as that is the case, then our house view is that rates will probably increase a little bit more and will probably stay a little bit higher for longer. Bank of England base rate is currently 4.5%, the highest level since 2008. The money markets are anticipating that rates could hit 5.5% by the end of the year, meaning people who must remortgage their loans face higher repayment costs. Stuart says: So, not the mortgage news we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be looking for. He doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe rates will fall back to 1%, and warns that rates won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t start to fall until inflation is much lower than it is today (it was 8.7% in April). Stuart explained that HSBC was forced to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcput a pause on business\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 coming in from brokers last Thursday, due to a supply and demand issue as people tried to secure mortgages. The Nationwide Building Society raised its mortgage rates last week, adding to the pressure on the market. New analysis suggests that around 2.6 million households with a mortgage could have to pay thousands of pounds more in repayments next year. The Times reports today: City figures said the mortgage market was going through a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complete reset\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that only a third of borrowers who are on cheap fixed-term deals had come off them so far. Analysis by Capital Economics found that a third of such households, equivalent to 3.2 million, are paying interest rates of 3 per cent or more. By the end of next year that will have risen to 5.8 million as the impact of higher interest rates passes through to the market. Also coming up today London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Queen Elizabeth II Centre is hosting London Tech Week, the 10th gathering of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest technology event. PM Rishi Sunak, chancellor Jeremy Hunt and Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology Chloe Smith are attending, as Britain pitches itself as a tech superpower and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the best place in the world to invest\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Asia Pacific (APAC) investors with over \u00c2\u00a3100bn of funds will be there, the government reports, and could put money into fintech, clean tech, life sciences and Artificial Intelligence firms. An \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcelevator pitch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 will be run at the London Eye, where 25 tech firms will have 30 minutes to pitch their latest innovations to investors before their pods circle back to the ground\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..

The media tycoon, who led three governments between 1994 and 2011 and whose Forza Italia party is a junior partner in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling coalition, had been diagnosed with leukaemia for some time. Berlusconi was one of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most flamboyant politicians, making a comeback in 2017 despite a career tainted by sex scandals, countless allegations of corruption and a tax fraud conviction. He died at the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, where he had spent six weeks this spring undergoing treatment for a lung infection linked to a chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia before being readmitted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A great friend and a great Italian man said goodbye to us today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I ask for a minute of silence for Silvio Berlusconi.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Born in Milan in 1936 to a middle-class family, Berlusconi began his business career in property development before going on to found Mediaset, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest commercial broadcaster. He also owned AC Milan football club between 1986 and 2017. Forza Italia was founded in 1993. A year later, Berlusconi was the first prime minister to be elected without previously having held a government office. His second term in office, between 2001 and 2006, was the longest served by any Italian leader since the second world war. He returned to power in 2008 but was forced to resign in 2011 amid an acute debt crisis. Berlusconi was convicted of tax fraud in late 2012, for which he served his year-long sentence doing part-time community service at a residential home in Milan. His ban on running for office was lifted in time for the general elections in 2018, when Forza Italia ran in coalition with the League and Brothers of Italy but fell short of the 40% required to govern. In 2019, Berlusconi won a seat in the European parliament, and in general elections in October 2022 his party returned to power in a coalition led by Giorgia Meloni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brothers of Italy. Berlusconi was also elected as a senator. Nicknamed Il Cavaliere (the knight), Berlusconi was often considered the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kingmaker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Italian politics. In 2016, he had surgery to replace a faulty aortic valve, and was admitted to hospital with Covid in September 2020. He had lingering complications related to the virus, an experience he described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the worst of my life\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He married twice, and was in a relationship with Francesca Pascale, 37, for seven years before a relationship with 33-year-old Marta Fascina, an MP with Forza Italia with whom he had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153symbolic marriage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in March 2022. He is survived by five children. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, described Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a great, enormous pain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dc\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcHe leaves a huge void because he was great.

Light as blossom, dark as coffee, a minuscule butterfly settles on the strap of Steve\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rucksack, opening dusky brown wings flecked with sky-blue glitter. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here to spot butterflies, but we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting such a rare treasure to seek us out. It is a male small blue, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tiniest resident butterfly, with a wingspan barely bigger than my thumbnail. Once known as the Bedford blue on account of a large population near that town, its Latin name \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Cupido minimus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is surely the most endearing of binomials.

Despite the species\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 local abundance in the 19th century in chalky areas where kidney vetch (its sole larval foodplant) grows, numbers declined significantly as a result of habitat loss from agricultural intensification and lack of sympathetic management. By the early 2000s, the small blue was thought to be extinct in Hertfordshire. But contrary to the national trend of diminishing distribution, several populations have been discovered in the county over the last 20 years, and the Hertfordshire and Middlesex branch of Butterfly Conservation has been working with landowners to promote awareness of the species\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 importance and support the conservation of known colonies. I spent many happy hours last June in a meadow on the edge of Letchworth Garden City watching small blues congregate in the late afternoon, prior to communal roosting.

The smoke is from the unprecedented wildfires that, first sparked by lightning, have been raging for weeks in Nova Scotia and Quebec; more than 450 are now burning across Canada. More than half of those are considered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153out of control\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That ferocity is thanks in large part to the kinds of unusually warm and dry conditions that rising temperatures are making more common. Winds from a low pressure system then fanned the flames and sent them southward. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd behind this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s haze is easier than the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, though. Legal processes in some states have assigned blame for past wildfires to specific companies. An investigation into the Marshall fire that devoured 1,000 Colorado homes in 2021 just pointed the finger at wayward sparks from Xcel Energy power lines. In northern California, courts charged the embattled utility PG&amp;E with failing to maintain land and lines that have sparked several deadly fires over the last several years. The deadliest of those \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most destructive in the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history \u00e2\u20ac\u201c killed 85 people and destroyed 14,000 homes. Last year the company agreed to pay $55m in penalties and costs to settle a series of civil cases brought against it by victims of the Kincaid and Dixie fires. How about all the other stuff that makes those fires so bad? One analysis found that 60% of recent developments in California are in wildfire-prone areas, which might have something to do with the fact that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest property insurer just announced that it will stop taking on most new policies there. And what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s causing all those hot, dry conditions? An analysis published last month in Environmental Research Letters examined how 88 of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top greenhouse gas-emitting companies have contributed to global temperature rise and the ensuing dryness (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153vapor pressure deficit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) that has made wildfires in the US more fearsome. Researchers also examined the amount of land burned. Using modeling to compare the world since 1901 against a counterfactual in which those companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 emissions never existed, researchers found that those 88 companies were responsible for roughly half of the additional dryness experienced over that time period in the western US and south-western Canada. The same companies were responsible for 37% of the area burned by wildfires there since 1986, the study found. Saudi Aramco sits at the top of that list of 88 fossil fuel and concrete companies, formerly 90 before mergers and acquisitions. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s followed by Chevron, ExxonMobil, Gazprom and BP. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to assign too much blame to roughnecks, engineers or gas station attendants, though. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the top brass at those companies who map out corporate strategy, tasking more poorly paid employees to earn profits that congeal at the top. ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods enjoyed a 52% pay bump last year amid record profits; his employees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pay fell by 9%. Shareholders who just rejected calls for Exxon and Chevron to set more stringent climate goals got fat payouts, too, of about $30m at each company. Still more galling is the fact that top executives at Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, Total and Eni got $15m worth of bonuses for meeting their own woefully inadequate climate targets. Consumer demand fuels these companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 decisions, to be sure. But there was no swell of drivers who asked Exxon or other polluters to fund the careers of self-described climate skeptics who spent decades working to stymie climate action in the US and abroad. One of those very ghouls popped up on Fox News this week to assure viewers that air pollution \u00e2\u20ac\u201c responsible for 10m deaths per year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was nothing to worry about. And however direct fossil fuel companies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 links to recent fires in Canada may be, researchers at Harvard and several other universities have already found that air pollution from burning fossil fuels is responsible for one in five deaths worldwide. As the smoke started to settle over the eastern seaboard, Twitter users began to snipe at one another, accusing the media of paying more attention to wildfire haze in New York and Washington DC after having allegedly neglected similar events out west. East coasters hit back. The right, meanwhile, set their crosshairs on Canada and its supposed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153climate cult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as Marjorie Taylor Greene put it. It makes sense that anyone facing conditions as awful as those caused by the smoke this week would get angry. The trick is to get angry at the right people: fossil fuel billionaires who couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care less about the horrors they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve unleashed.

It is part of a wider backlash against corporate involvement in social, environmental or political issues that appears to be gathering steam. Corporate celebration of Pride month over recent years has seemed less radical amid growing criticism that parades and other events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights have actually become too corporatized. Critics have also pointed out that those same businesses are more than happy to fund politicians that oppose LGBTQ+ rights when it suits them. But conservatives have put those sponsorships back in the spotlight and are now more emboldened than ever to turn their fury against them. At the political vanguard is Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, Ron DeSantis, the presidential candidate who is in the middle of a legal battle with Disney after the company publicly criticized his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say gay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bill to curb discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity in schools. But the attack on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153woke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd corporations from conservative consumers and the politicians who court their support goes far further than Pride. Multiple Republican states, including Texas, West Virginia and Florida, have divested from investment firm BlackRock for the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support of environmental, social and governance portfolios that focus on sustainability and environmental impact. It is a notable change for Republicans, who for decades have been the party of business and fought the idea of government interference. Their hero, Ronald Reagan, once said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153man is not free unless government is limited\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But a shift has been happening. Since 2019, the percentage of Republicans who say large corporations have a positive impact has fallen by a quarter, according to a 2021 Pew poll. A Gallup poll showed a similar drop in Republicans who were happy with the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153size and influence of major corporations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, dropping from 57% to 31% in a year. Much of this comes from conservative distaste of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153woke capitalism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with companies coming out in support of progressive issues, such as LGBTQ+ rights, racial equity and concern over the environment, over the last decade. The shift has a strong business case. Younger Americans, who are more diverse and also more liberal, have come of age as consumers and companies have been trying to cater to them by promoting issues they care about. That comes with a price. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Millennials and younger generations are pushing this, and they have the idea that companies have a social responsibility beyond their business,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Amna Kirmani, a professor of marketing at the University of Maryland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Conservatives think that companies should stay out of sociopolitical issues and instead focus on their business.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other words, companies can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appeal to everyone in such a divisive political landscape, as they are quickly finding out. Now that two major corporations have pulled back on marketing efforts that promote LGBTQ+ issues in the face of a rightwing backlash, some experts say conservative resolve against companies promoting the issues has been strengthened. Bud Light had been trying to revive its brand to appeal to younger Americans when it turned to TikTok influencer Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender woman, for a sponsored post on social media. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our number one job at Bud Light is to grow meaning and relevance with new drinkers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that is how we transform and really preserve this brand for the next 40 years,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alissa Heinerscheid, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice-president of marketing, told Ad Age in September. The backlash to the brand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s partnership with Mulvaney was intense, eventually leading to sales in Bud Light dropping by at least 23% compared to last year. Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Bud Light, put Heinerscheid and another marketing executive on leave. Brendan Whitworth, chief executive of Anheuser-Busch inBev, said in a statement in April amid the boycott that the brand \u00e2\u20ac\u0153never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just a few weeks later, Target announced it would remove some of its Pride month merchandise from some of its stores after a series of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153volatile circumstances\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in which a handful of customers confronted workers and damaged displays in stores. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has really emboldened a lot of conservative activists to keep shouting because in these two cases, there were serious consequences,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kirmani said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boycotts happen all the time, most of them are not successful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ire against Bud Light and Target quickly spread to Kohl\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, which received bomb threats for displaying Pride month merchandise, and Chick-fil-A, which had hired an executive to lead diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives at the company. The attack on Chick-fil-A surprised many given the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long history of supporting rightwing causes. Backlashes also pointed to Nike, North Face, the US navy and the LA Dodgers baseball team for social media posts and campaigns that celebrated Pride month. Eric Bloem, vice-president of programs and corporate advocacy at the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, said that it stresses to companies that they need to be prepared to defend their values when faced with attacks. Nike and North Face, he pointed out, stood by their decision to work with transgender models (Nike had worked with Mulvaney) after they faced backlash. Meanwhile, Bud Light and Target backed off. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The message that it sends is that it fuels extremist behavior \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and that they can make Pride toxic. Once they are able to make Pride toxic for one company, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to move on to the next,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloem said. Both Kirmani and Bloem said the conservative backlash against companies comes from a minority of people with extreme views. A survey from the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Glaad showed that 75% of participants said they are comfortable seeing LGBTQ+ people in advertising. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be clear that this is a coordinated attack against the LGBTQ+ community by a small group of extremists,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bloem said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over 525 pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ pieces of legislation that have been pushed at the state level. These pieces of legislation are banning books, access to gender-affirming care for youth, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re preventing trans youth from participating in sports. All of this is part of the larger context.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The wider context also suggests this fight isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to end soon. The attacks on Target and Bud Light had real impact and DeSantis is not the only 2024 Republican presidential runner taking on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153woke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd corporations. Outlier candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, a 37-year-old tech entrepreneur, has made his fight against corporate liberalism the centerpiece of his campaign. He is positioning his company, Strive Asset Management, as an alternative to investment firms like BlackRock. Ramaswamy may not be a frontrunner but he is gaining airtime and his message has the support of Republican House speaker Kevin McCarthy and others. His views may be out of touch with younger voters, and many other Americans, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one that captures an angry base that has found a cause to fight for. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Courage Is Contagious\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is Ramaswamy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign slogan.

Along with our beloved cat, Shyboy, and four chickens, we also kept sheep. Strange as it sounds, we kept them as pets \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they reminded my stepfather of his childhood on a farm. I remember all 16 of them, even the one or two lambs we sent to get slaughtered each year to keep numbers down. The rest stayed with us until they died of natural causes. It was a gentle, hands-on lifestyle. The sheep were virtually domesticated, feeding from our hands and allowing us to pet them. All except one \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Blossom, an absurdly curly, silver-wool Welsh breed, who never quite took to our ways. Blossom was anxious, slow and, it was once said, an impulsive addition. We only had her a few months before she got pregnant. It was the school holidays, so I was at home when she went into labour one morning. It was late April, drizzling, and the clouds were lilac-grey. I remember because as my sister and I trudged up to the small meadows that fanned around our cottage, Blossom, who was standing at the top, almost disappeared against the skyline. She was pawing at the ground, making a low grunting noise. My stepfather could read these sounds like a mother with her baby. This is why he called the vet. It was clear something wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t right. The biggest giveaway was that she let us approach her. The vet appeared in the meadow and, bending over her, told us she wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t progressing. He looked up and scanned us, quickly identifying that I had the smallest hands, and gave me some disposable plastic gloves and lubricant. My mother appeared with a bucket of warm water. I slipped on the first glove. As I bent down, I knew this would make \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a story\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I thought carefully about how I would frame things in my telling, how I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d play it down. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a hero, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say: these are. Then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d show everyone my small hands. I pulled on the second glove, and laughed to myself. Then the vet told me the lambs were probably dead. I put my hand inside, way over the glove, and found the first lamb. It was hot and stiff. It needed to come out front legs first but it was curled up. I hooked two fingers into its mouth to reposition its body, and pulled. I heard a low pop, most likely the sound of its neck breaking in my hand. Keep going, said the vet. Eventually it came out. I did the same with the second: cracked its neck, and gently pulled that out too. It took about 10 minutes. The sun was coming up as the two dead lambs lay in the wet grass, cold but steaming, under Blossom\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legs. She sniffed at them, urging them to get up, while we watched. I was relieved they were out, relieved it was over. But I remember looking at Blossom, as she realised through her fringe of curls that her babies were dead, and seeing that keening grief overwhelm her. I remember my sister going into the field, trying to comfort her in the days that followed. But what did we know about maternal grief? Blossom never got pregnant again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think she really recovered. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know that then, of course. I was a child.

A table the morning after is like a beach after a storm, so clearing it is a bit like beachcombing, picking through the crusts of bread, mandarin peelings, spills and caps, and discovering that the wire cage from the fizzy wine has been re-twisted into a stick man, a Ferrero Rocher wrapper is now a ring and a walnut shell has been turned into a tiny ashtray. The table didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong to me, but to an old friend. We had both enjoyed plenty of wine, and it was Sunday, and raining outside, and everyone else was sleeping or under duvets and watching stuff on their devices, so there was no reason or rush to do anything. We sat at the table with the debris, drinking coffee for ages, and deciding to move only when we needed to eat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the kids, too. There were pots and pans all over the stove and we needed some space. The biggest pot had what seemed to me extremely dry remains at the bottom, so I put it in the sink and turned on the tap, figuring that a good soak would help. I am still not sure how my friend managed to get from the table to the tap so quickly, especially given the state of us. She leapt up, shouting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stop!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and, as she did so, slammed the tap off and tipped the pan upside down. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are the best bits, you maniac,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said (in Italian), before sitting down again and rubbing her head. Fortunately, polenta left overnight in a pan is resistant and firm enough to be almost waterproof, so the water I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d sent in was easily tipped out and the remains patted dry with a kitchen towel. By this point, everyone was awake, so the clearing up was shared in order to start eating again. Getting overnight polenta out of a pan requires mixed implements, if you want to get at every single bit. A spoon is best for scooping out the softer bits, or you can shave them off with a knife, while a spatula is best for scraping down the sides, and a flexible palette knife is ideal for the bits that seem to be soldered to the bottom. Once it was all out of the pan, the polenta looked like an enormous heap of uneven rubble, which is the key to its fried success. First, a good amount of butter and olive oil were heated in the biggest iron frying pan until they foamed. A loose layer of polenta was added and pressed down, so the bottom got a golden crust and sort of held together (although neatness is not the aim), before the whole thing was flipped. While the new bottom got a crust of its own, the top was covered thickly with grated parmesan, which melted and created a mesh in the gaps. The granular nature of polenta means that, when fried, it develops a great crust as well as a centre that is a little like custard. Eggs and bacon were fried in other pans and then piled on top of each serving of cheese-polenta rubble, which, at that moment, was one of the best breakfasts I had ever eaten. It is also one of the best snacks. And you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to leave the polenta to set in a pan, either; leftover soft polenta can be scraped into an oiled tray or on to a piece of greaseproof paper and left to set firm overnight. Then, the next evening or the one after that, when you open a bottle of wine, cut slices or thin wedges from the fat pancake of polenta, fry them until golden and, in the last seconds of cooking, sprinkle very generously with parmesan, which again should be allowed to melt like a mesh. However, if you do happen to leave the polenta in the pan for hours, once you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve excavated it and turned it into breakfast or a snack with a cold drink, fill the pan with water and leave it to soak before even thinking about tackling the actual washing-up. Fried polenta with cheese You hardly need a recipe for this, but here are a few notes: Leftover polenta, or 200g polenta or instant polenta cooked according to instructions and either poured into a tray or left to cool in a pan Butter and olive oil, for frying 50-100g grated parmesan Either break the polenta into an uneven rubble or cut into slices. Then, in a large frying pan warm a good amount of butter and olive oil and fry the polenta until deeply golden on both sides. Sprinkle really generously with parmesan and wait a few seconds until that melts. For breakfast, serve with fried eggs and bacon, or for an aperitivo or snack, serve immediately with a favourite drink."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/12/you-can-live-forever-review-secret-affair-for-jehovahs-witness-teens-in-gay-awakening", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "You Can Live Forever review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c secret affair for Jehovah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Witness teens in gay awakening", "lead": "Two young women uneasily living in a religious community in Quebec embark on a secret affair", "author": "Peter Bradshaw", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T10:00:17Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764195", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d7410b37f18d48b8cfe5a012e4d26eba6ac3e240/0_62_2935_1761/500.jpg", "body": "There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some soap-operatic gusto to this story of two teenage gay women in a Jehovah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Witness community in Quebec; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got something of Jeanette Winterson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenderness, if not exactly the wit, and the movie is interesting and even faintly subversive in its implied analogies concerning conversion and enclosed behaviour systems. Anwen O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Driscoll brings some Anna Kendrick energy to the role of Jaime, a smart teen whose mum suffers a breakdown after the death of her dad from a heart attack. She has been sent away to live with her aunt Beth (Liane Balaban), who with her husband Jean-Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois (Antoine Yared), is a devout Jehovah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Witness and expects Jaime to obey their rules and show up to their religious services wearing the very uncool Handmaid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s-Tale dress they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve picked out for her. Gloweringly, Jaime complies but is struck as by a lightning-bolt at the sight of beautiful Marike (June Laporte) in the congregation; she lives with her older sister Amanda (Deragh Campbell) and Amanda\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s alpha-male husband Frank (Tim Campbell), fierce JW folk, all. Marike is wounded by the fact that her mother was shunned, or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disfellowshipped\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, by the believers who now encourage her to believe that her mother is dead; this is a painful echo of Jaime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own bereavement. Soon, Jaime and Marike are hanging out together all the time, going to meetings, going door-to-door with leaflets, and kissing in the toilets of the cinema during a speciously heterosexual double-date with two lunkheaded JW boys. There is a wildly romantic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153baptism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scene in the bath where the erotic excitement is elided with religious enthusiasm. But the film upends expectations to some degree: it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t simply about oppressive belief clamping down on gay people. As a Jehovah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Witness in a secular world, Marike is accustomed to living a semi-secret life and used to persistently trying to convert people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not that Jaime needs to be converted in the emotional sense. I was reminded a little of Apostasy by the British film-maker Daniel Kokotajlo, in which the emotional stakes were a little higher. A sympathetic, fervent drama nonetheless. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 You Can Live Forever is released on 16 June in UK cinemas and digital platforms."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/12/you-cant-argue-against-a-computer-has-the-pub-quiz-lost-its-soul", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t argue against a computer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: has the pub quiz lost its soul?", "lead": "The perfect trivia night is an elusive mix of brains, beer and banter, but are slick question-setting companies sapping the scene of its community spirit?", "author": "Francisco Garcia", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T10:00:16Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764197", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/965b8a7d64076b3d4f2fcc81dd12eb2643ff4a85/27_15_2139_1283/500.jpg", "body": "The Hooden Horse is a utilitarian new-ish build pub located in a retail park on the fringes of Margate. It can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be many people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idea of a destination boozer but this changes around 8pm every Wednesday, when the place is enveloped in quiz mania. Local radio presenter Mark Cridland has hosted proceedings for the past seven years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some weeks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 13 teams, or it might be 30,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he chuckles from a corner table as he runs through a last-minute checklist, tucked away from the rapidly filling room. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have our regulars who are hardcore quizzers. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the ones who will let me know if I mispronounce a word.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Every week, thousands of broadly identical scenes can be observed across the country, from the south coast to the outer fringes of the Highlands; from A-road chain pubs to the most idiosyncratic locals. These offerings range from casual to rabidly competitive. Some, such as Cridland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, are often both. My trip to Thanet was one of several night-time visitations around the country, trying to chart the future of a very British institution. What sort of health was the pub quiz in? How did it work? And what did the apparently inexorable rise of professionalised pub quiz companies mean for a pastime more traditionally associated with homespun volunteer spirit? The pub quiz occupies its own specific corner of the British psyche. It is, after all, almost universally regarded as an invention from these isles. Some of the most reliable pub historians trace things back to late-1950s Merseyside and Lancashire, when about 4,000 people became involved in the organised quiz leagues that sprung up from Bootle to Southport, although the Guinness Book of Records makes mention of a night in Yorkshire dating from 1946. The Liverpool Echo of 30 October 1963 carried an interview with a Mr Jack Robinson, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the men who has been on the Merseyside quiz scene since it started\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a jolly good way of enjoying yourself,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Robinson, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and learning at the same time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Burns and Porter, the first mass-market pub quiz company, was founded in 1976 and soon dominated the nascent industry, producing a string of successful books and providing their services to the BBC. This was, as pub historian and author of the reference book Played at the Pub, Arthur Taylor, has noted, also the tail end of the first era of wildly popular quiz programmes on British TV. Sharon Burns and Tom Porter were savvy marketers who pitched their wares as an easy way to boost trade on the quieter nights of the week. It was, as it has remained, an easy sell. Cheap to host, quizzes attract a regular clientele of dedicated and often obsessive regulars. Dr Patrick Chaplin is the avuncular chairman of the Pub History Society. He explains some of this enduring appeal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You get the really serious people, the anoraks, but it can just be something you enjoy as a team. There are so many different aspects to it. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the clever buggers who want to win and those who just want to have a good time and a few beers.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For a few months in late 2022, my Wednesday nights were taken up with the quiz at my south London local, as part of a small and quietly competitive regular team. What had started as a pleasantly noncommittal excuse for a midweek drink with friends had ratcheted up a few degrees of intensity. The quiz was perfectly pitched: hard enough to serve as a challenge, yet accessible to the point where victory was a realistic prospect (we won twice, in faintly dramatic fashion). But something changed, for me at least, with the departure of our regular host, the drag artist Kate Butch. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that their replacement wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any good, or that the content of the quiz had declined. But something had shifted, a slight tilting in the vibe that led to our visits becoming less frequent. There are, perhaps, no hard rules to what does and doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make a good pub quiz. Much depends on personal preference, although most of the devoted quizzers I spoke with tended to run through the same list. Fairness is critical, as is a robust mixture of questions and the sense that a degree of passion and thoroughness had gone into its composition. The last point is particularly important. Whether they came from professional companies or lone quizmasters, lazy, cookie-cutter offerings were to be abhorred. And the host is a crucial factor. Jennifer Woodbridge runs the regular night at Vinoteq, a Dover wine bar. She is also the partner of Mark Cridland: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want people to talk, to become mates. The whole point is getting people together.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Diplomacy can be just as important as any finer feelings. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen Biros thrown [and] people threatening to throw pints in faces,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she laughs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There can be a lot of gloating and sulking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Every pub has its own specific level of intensity. Susan Markham-Uden runs the monthly quiz at the White Horse in Brancaster Staithe, north Norfolk, with all proceeds going to local charities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no pattern to who wins. No team ever dominates but we do have a core of about a dozen people who come every month. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lovely social thing [for] the local community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdThe pub quiz is sitting at an awkward moment in its history. During lockdown, Zoom offerings allowed some thin pretence of sociability to thousands across the country and made minor celebrities out of some, such as Jay Flynn, the pub landlord turned online quizmaster who raised \u00c2\u00a31.3m for charity during the pandemic. The pub quiz remains crucial to thousands of landlords who have struggled through a series of overlapping disasters, from Covid to jacked-up energy bills. In 2020, it was thought that more than half of UK pubs had a regular quiz. A more recent survey suggested that Durham was the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pub quiz capital with 24 weekly offerings in a city of 50,000, with Chichester, Wakefield, Salisbury and Preston making up the rest of the top five. As with many things pub-related, there is a tendency to think in enjoyably hazy cliches. The image of the local quizmaster toiling away at their labour of love, recompensed with nothing more than a few rounds from the bar, is a romantic one. The reality, however, is of a discipline that has been increasingly professionalised. Derbyshire-based Redtooth is the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest provider, with more than 3,000 pubs and clubs a week receiving their weekly quizzes, while a cursory search reveals boutique firms with often desperately corny names, websites groaning under the weight of glowing testimonials. For some, this increasing slickness is pure progress. Questions are usually fresh and well considered. Paired with a capable host, they work as well as anything else, even if some have bemoaned the slow fading of the enthusiastic amateur quizmaster. Alex Douglas is the founder of Inquizition, the company responsible for my local\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiz night, as well as dozens of others across London and beyond. An avid quizzer growing up, the musician began writing, and hosting, his first night at the Regent in Balham, south London, back in January 2011. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[It started] as a side hustle,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was an exciting time. Other pubs started to want them because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d heard how good it was.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite their growth, the format has broadly remained the same. Word puzzles, picture and music rounds, as well as a high-stakes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wipeout round\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to close the game. Writing the questions alongside his two business partners is a painstaking process, taking about 60 hours a week between them, before being fired across to in-house verifier Rob, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153who we call \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe robot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just incredible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The more venues they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve accumulated, the higher the stakes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a medical question, for instance, you might have a doctor or a nurse in the room. You have to research things so thoroughly. Of course, it has to be perfect but you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too bogged down. It has to be fun as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On a damp Tuesday night in mid-April, I made my way down to a pub about a mile from my local. My partner and I had been meaning to try out the quiz night for several weeks. If not quite a shock, it felt odd to be presented with the latest Inquizition offering. It was as good and evenly judged as ever, though it was hard to shake the slight feeling of deja vu and deflation. All the right questions were being asked, just in the wrong pub. The host felt unfamiliar, as did the setting. We got through it fine, though the cosiness and vaguely conspiratorial feeling of the best quizzes was missing. This evidently wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case in Margate. I had wanted to know what kept Mark Cridland coming back, year after year. It was the buzz, although there had been changes during his time in the hot seat. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen quite a few places bringing in the online quizzes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he explained. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t something he felt much enthusiasm over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People have told me that it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the same as having a quizmaster. For one thing, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t argue against the computer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At heart, it was a simple format, with simple joys. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People love to argue the toss over anything. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little community, isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what pubs are made for.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/12/nicola-sturgeon-should-give-up-snp-membership-says-ex-leadership-rival", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Nicola Sturgeon should give up SNP membership, says ex-leadership rival", "lead": "Ash Regan, who quit as minister over gender recognition reforms, calls for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdecisive action\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from party leaders", "author": "Severin Carrell and Libby Brooks", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T09:56:46Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764199", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d37f7dd732cabf953cccb063609a739d9351064f/479_423_2967_1780/500.jpg", "body": "Nicola Sturgeon should consider voluntarily suspending her Scottish National party membership until the police investigation into its finances is over, a former leadership candidate has said.

If Sturgeon did not voluntarily step down, Humza Yousaf, her successor as party leader, should consider suspending her, Regan added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The leadership needs to think about taking decisive action.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sturgeon was arrested and questioned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as a suspect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on Sunday by Police Scotland detectives as part of their investigation into the SNP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances after a series of complaints were made about the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s handling of more than \u00c2\u00a3600,000 in donations for an independence campaign. On Sunday night, shortly after being released without charge, Sturgeon said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the strongest possible terms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that she was entirely innocent of any wrongdoing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Innocence is not just a presumption I am entitled to in law,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said in a short statement on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know beyond doubt that I am in fact innocent of any wrongdoing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yousaf, who was Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favoured successor as party leader and first minister, has refused to suspend Peter Murrell, Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s husband, and the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then-treasurer Colin Beattie MSP, after they were arrested and questioned as part of the same inquiry. Like Sturgeon, they were released without charge and Yousaf said therefore there should be a presumption of innocence. However, the leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critics argue there have been numerous examples of MPs and MSPs under investigation or accused of significant wrongdoing being suspended by the party or their voluntary resignations being welcomed by party leaders. Angus MacNeil, the MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar and an ally of Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessor, Alex Salmond, tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This soap opera has gone far enough, Nicola Sturgeon suspended others from the SNP for an awful lot less! Time for political distance until the investigation ends either way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His intervention infuriated other SNP parliamentarians. James Dornan, the SNP MSP for Glasgow Cathcart, suggested MacNeil should be kicked out of the party for his remarks. He tweeted that what would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153help the cause of independence is get rid of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoo big to discipline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 MPs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such as MacNeil. Regan, whose leadership campaign was run by one of Salmond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former advisers, said there had to be some accountability. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Accountability in these types of situations is really important. Nicola is not doubt considering this at the moment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Regan said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is precedent in the party for people who have been involved in issues of this type to resign from the party, voluntarily suspending their membership until this can be cleared up.

There is currently no law to require employers to protect their staff from clients, customers or service users who experience this kind of harassment. A recent report from the TUC found that 58% of women had experienced harassment at work, rising to almost 62% of women aged 25 to 34 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a group over-represented in customer-facing roles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c had experienced sexual harassment, bullying or verbal abuse at work. In 39% of these incidents, the perpetrator was a third party rather than another member of staff. A survey by the Usdaw union last year found 90% of shopworkers had experienced verbal abuse, 64% had been threatened by a customer and 12% had been assaulted. It follows a government survey on sexual harassment from 2020 that found 1.5 million people every year face sexual harassment from a third party at work. The scale of third-party harassment beyond sexual \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, of a racist or homophobic nature \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is not so clear. Public-sector workers are also affected: an Nasuwt survey of 8,466 teachers found that one in four had been verbally abused by a parent or carer, and NHS staff have reported 20,000 incidents of sexual violence and misconduct from patients in the past five years. Service industries employ 82% of the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s workforce and this is likely to rise. Some experts predict that as artificial intelligence increasingly takes on administrative tasks, there will be an increased demand for people to make up for its lack of humanity and more customer-facing roles will be created as a result. If so, worker protection from third-party harassment could become an even bigger issue in the UK. For a brief period, there was legislation in place to tackle third-party harassment and it can be traced back to an unlikely source \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the notorious comedian Bernard Manning. In 1996, Sonia Rhule and Freda Burton, two black women employed by De Vere hotels as casual waiting staff, successfully sued the company for discrimination after working at an event at which the late comedian told racist jokes and guests subjected the women to racial and sexual harassment. To seal this precedent into law, third-party harassment was folded into the Equality Act 2010. The act protects workers from harassment or discrimination on the basis of protected characteristics such as sexuality, sex, race, religion or disability. Employers had a legal duty to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153take all reasonable steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to ensure this sort of harassment did not happen in the workplace at the hands of other people they employed. Section 40 of the act also required that employers prevent third-party harassment with a three-strike rule; employers were to take all reasonable steps to prevent third-party harassment at work where they were aware of it having occurred on at least two occasions. Repeat harassment is a particular issue, the TUC has found, with 52% of respondents to the survey reporting that they had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experienced harassment, abuse or violence from a third party two or more times\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, with this figure dropping to 30% of people who have been harassed more than three times. Jane, who has now moved roles, experienced harassment on more than one occasion: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m stupid, and that I am trying to kill somebody because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not able to provide their medication that same day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government repealed section 40 in 2013 after a public consultation that found: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many employers or their representative bodies have told us that they find this piece of legislation confusing and unnecessary.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In 2021, with a shift in public mood after the #MeToo movement, the government promised to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153introduce explicit protections from third-party harassment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This was followed in June last year by the worker protection bill, brought as a private member\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bill by Wera Hobhouse, a Liberal Democrat MP. Initially supported by the government, campaigners fear the bill is languishing as it awaits a committee-stage reading in the Lords. As with amendments suggested in the Commons, the Lords\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 amendments relate to concerns around free speech. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Would Waterstones, for example, risk an instore book signing by JK Rowling or Helen Joyce on the off-chance that one of the author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fans might be wearing a T-shirt that says, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWoman Equals Adult Human Female\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, knowing that an employee could sue for hurt feelings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c real or vexatious?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lord Strathcarron in response to the bill. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are real issues facing real businesses. I suggest we are wading into very dangerous waters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In response, Lady Scott, a Conservative minister, said that as long as an employer \u00e2\u20ac\u0153can show it has taken all reasonable steps to prevent the harassment by having in place an effective anti-harassment policy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it would be safe from vexatious claims. The government Equality Hub has tabled amendments that allow for third parties to express opinions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that are not deemed grossly offensive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c among themselves without the employer facing liability. A group of unions and campaigners jointly signed an open letter last month calling for the government to not give up its support for the bill. Deeba Syed, senior legal officer at Rights of Women and a signatory of the letter, says the government must act on the promise it made in 2021. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are still waiting. There are currently no legal protections to hold employers accountable for third-party harassment, which has led to a prevailing attitude that tolerating abuse and harassment in a public-facing role is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpart of the job\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know from our legal advice line service that this gap in the law means employers can refuse to intervene or take any safeguarding measures if a perpetrator of harassment is not their employee.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She cites examples of harassment towards everyone from care workers involved in bathing and toileting patients to client-facing executives with no opportunity to complain for fear of losing business. The government Equality Hub has not provided the Guardian with a timetable of the progress of the worker protection bill. Syed adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have been concerned to learn of reports that the government may seek to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwater down\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or remove third-party protections altogether from the bill. This would leave an already gaping hole in protections for workers unaddressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd * Some names have been changed"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/12/assassins-review-sondheim-dark-chichester-festival-theatre", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Assassins review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sondheim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dark study of aspiring presidential killers", "lead": "Polly Findlay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s production underlines the way these left-behinds and psychopaths invert the American dream", "author": "Arifa Akbar", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T09:45:16Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764203", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/149ca50289b1bcfac752d7fcea8a30f703a3dc2b/350_415_4500_2700/500.jpg", "body": "It begins as a presidential convention complete with Mexican waves, spangled stars and mascots.

The Proprietor is a presidential figure, the Balladeers news anchors. The assassins lounge in what looks to be the Oval office. Along the stage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s central flank is a red carpet and these personalities are the stars, with screens on either side that update us on their crimes. This is a thoroughly accomplished reconceptualisation by director Polly Findlay, with an inspired set design by Lizzie Clachan. It underlines the way in which these oddballs, left-behinds and psychopaths invert the American dream, turning their failures into righteous fury, and getting their 15 minutes of fame through infamy. There is confetti as guns are shot into presidents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chests and even the executions contain the pizzazz of a showbiz death: lights around the gallows as James Garfield\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assassin, Charles Guiteau (Harry Hepple), is hanged and around the electric chair of Giuseppe Zangara (Luke Brady) for Roosevelt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attempted murder. While there is much in the production that dazzles, the musical in itself does not shock, enlighten or provoke as much as it seeks to in its narrative around the American dream and those it leaves behind. It is gloriously performed and strong on dark comedy though. Danny Mac leads the pack as Abraham Lincoln\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s murderer, John Wilkes Booth, proving himself a strong singer. Sam Oladeinde, as William McKinley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assassin, Leon Czolgosz, bears the justified rage of a ground-down factory worker. Nick Holder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stalker-like Samuel Byck resembles the Joker in a soiled Santa Claus suit, tape recorder in hand, as he sends off angry missives to Richard Nixon. Hepple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guiteau is an impish psychopath while Lynette Fromme (Carly Mercedes Dyer) and Sara Jane Moore (Amy Booth-Steel), the duo behind the attempted murder of Gerald Ford, make a music-hall style double act.

The satire, bathos and beauty of numbers such as How I Saved Roosevelt and Gun Song are well evoked while Weidman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s book slides between vaudevillian comedy and farce but never quite reaches tragedy. Samuel Thomas gives the most affecting performance as Lee Harvey Oswald. His assassination of John F Kennedy is accompanied by original footage of the cavalcade, just as Kennedy is shot, and it is the one moment that feels truly shocking. Still, if there were ever an argument against the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gun laws in musical form, this would be it.

In the early hours of Monday morning, the grid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electricity system operator (ESO) asked its owner, Uniper, to ready its Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire for use. Temperatures broke 30C for the first time this year over the weekend and meteorologists forecast the chance of Britain experiencing a hot summer was 45% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 2.3 times the typical figure. The hot weather is expected to push up demand for power, as households and businesses switch on airconditioning units. Air conditioning accounts for about a fifth of the total electricity used in buildings around the world. The earliest the coal-fired plant would be able to connect to Great Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s electricity grid would be 2.25pm and it may not be needed. If it is connected to the network on Monday, it would end a 46-day run in which coal has not been used to generate electricity in Britain. National Grid has suggested that consumers can improve the energy efficiency of air conditioning by changing or cleaning the machine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reusable filter, closing windows and doors and by shutting curtains to block the sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s light and heat coming into the home. Last week, a fault was found on the 1,400-megawatt North Sea Link interconnector that carries power between Norway and the UK, cutting electricity supplies. The power flowing through the 450-mile subsea cable has been reduced by half while the fault, discovered at an onshore facility in Norway, is repaired. Ratcliffe-on-Soar was among the coal-fired power stations put on standby to provide extra power by the ESO over the winter amid concerns that a cold snap and a reduction in gas from Russia to Europe could lead to rolling blackouts. In the event, the plants were frequently warmed but only called into action in March, when EDF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s West Burton A plant in Nottinghamshire began producing power before the coldest night of the year. The life of Ratcliffe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth unit was extended for two years beyond its planned closure date last year, with all units now due to shut by September 2024 as Britain phases out burning coal for power generation. The ESO also called on households to save power by shifting their usage away from peak hours through its demand flexibility service. The network operator said last month that households and businesses saved enough power over the winter to power 10m homes."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jun/12/nine-out-of-10-people-are-biased-against-women-says-alarming-un-report", "primaryCategory": "global-development", "title": "Nine out of 10 people are biased against women, says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcalarming\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 UN report", "lead": "Researchers \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshocked\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at lack of progress, and entrenched social norms that curtail women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances in politics, business and work", "author": "Kaamil Ahmed", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T09:35:13Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764206", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/56ce3028a6ce78cfeadf150be8f3d802dc9c64c8/372_729_5585_3351/500.jpg", "body": "Bias against women is as entrenched as it was a decade ago and gender equality progress has gone into reverse, according to a UN report. Nine out of 10 people of all genders have a bias against women, found the Gender Social Norms Index, a figure unchanged from data collected more than a decade ago. Published by the UN development programme on Monday, it found that half of people in 80 countries believe men make better political leaders, 40% believe men are better business executives and a quarter believe it is justified for men to beat their wives. These figures, from data collected between 2017 and 2022, were largely unchanged from the previous GSNI report, published in 2020, which used data from 2005 to 2014. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My expectation was that we would see some progress, because nine out of every 10, I mean, how can it get any worse?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pedro Concei\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o, head of UNDP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s human development report office. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it was also a period in which we saw, for example, the #MeToo movement and a lot of visibility to the very shocking ways in which these bias norms affect women. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, doing this exercise has been an experience of shock after shock.

The Brentford goalie David Raya, meanwhile, may become Ange Postecoglou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first signing as the Australian takes the reins at Spurs. Brentford want \u00c2\u00a340m for the 27-year-old but Tottenham, perhaps needless to say, are keen to beat them down a bit on the price for a player with only a year left on his current contract, reports PA Media. Ilkay G\u00c3\u00bcndogan, who helped Manchester City to seal the treble in Istanbul on Saturday night, has been offered a one-year contract extension to stay at the Etihad and a three-year deal by Barcelona, while a number of Saudi clubs are also interested in signing the 32-year-old. Arsenal, too, are said to be keen on the Germany international. All that information thanks to transfer gossip king, Fabrizio Romano. Relegated Leeds want to sign the Coventry City midfielder Gustavo Hamer while, off the pitch, Graham Potter and Brendan Rodgers are both live options when it comes to a manager to replace \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Big\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sam Allardyce after his brief and unsuccessful relegation firefight. Last but not least up to Scotland, where Celtic are pondering the possibility of hiring the 34-year-old Italian, Francesco Farioli, to replace Postecoglu. He coached under Robert de Zerbi at Benevento and Sassuolo in Italy and left the Turkish club, Alanyaspor, in February.

Purslow had been in charge of the day-to-day running of the club for almost five years but has left as part of a restructuring. Villa are ramping up their attempts to appoint a sporting director to work closely with Emery. After Barcelona\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mateu Alemany rejected a move to Villa Park, Emery is keen on reuniting with Monchi, with whom he worked at Sevilla. It is thought Monchi, the Sevilla sporting director, has a release clause of about \u00c2\u00a31.7m. Emery has been given great freedom to reshape Villa after leading the club into Europe for the first time in 13 years despite succeeding Steven Gerrard last November amid relegation concerns. A new sporting director would take care of the football business operations, in conjunction with Emery. Last month Villa announced the arrival of Chris Heck as president of business operations. Alberto Benito and Pablo Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez have also recently been appointed to Villa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recruitment staff. It is thought Purslow, who worked in executive positions at Chelsea and Liverpool, declined the chance to stay in a different role. In a club statement Villa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners, Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens, paid tribute to the 59-year-old for his role in overseeing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a transformation of the club both on and off the pitch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

On Saturday Villa announced the signing of Youri Tielemans on a free after the Belgium midfielder exited Leicester City.

In a 40-minute video presentation given as part of Sunday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Xbox Showcase in LA, the development team working under director Todd Howard spelt out its wildly ambitious project in detail \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so, so much detail. You play as a member of the Constellation, a famed group of space explorers who have stumbled across a strange artefact that hints at an ancient alien intelligence, or perhaps even god. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the main quest-line, but players can also discover myriad side quests and mini-missions handed out by a vast number of non-player characters. The game starts in the sprawling utopian city of New Atlantis on Alpha Centauri, but as play progresses, you move farther away from the peaceful United Colonies, and into the territory of the Independent Coalition of Star Systems, a ragtag frontier of cyberpunk worlds. Outside those lies uncharted space, teeming with hostile factions. Combat has been a key focus, with the team looking to improve the sometimes floaty, bullet-sponge feel of RPG shoot-outs. (This is something that Xbox chief Phil Spencer was keen to emphasise: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked on some bigger sci-fi RPGs in my past and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always felt like the gunplay kind of didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always live up to what I wanted in a game. But Starfield plays really well as an action game, even though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this deep RPG, and I really enjoy that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) It promises fast, solid first-person shooter-style encounters, featuring shotguns, SMGs, sniper rifles and energy weapons. Space battles are also very much a thing. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible to attack and then board other ships, fight the crew and finally claim the craft and all its contents as your own. In-depth personalisation is set to be a major element. Players get to use a vast character creation toolkit (apparently the same tech used by the developers to build the game\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s non-player characters), allowing intricate control over appearance and clothing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Bethesda scanned dozens of real faces from a diverse range of ages and ethnicities to get skin tones and features correct. There are different backgrounds to choose from, such as combat medic, diplomat or chef, allowing you to construct a biography for the character, and traits such as introvert and empath colour your interactions with NPCs. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also possible to customise weapons and spacecraft, adding hundreds of different upgrades and aesthetic frills. During the presentation, Bethesda showed off one craft designed to resemble a giant mech. While exploring the galaxy, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also able to build personalised outposts on any planet you fancy. These can be homes, but also mines set up with their own AI crew to gather a planet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resources while you do other things. The base-building is highly reminiscent of UK studio Hello Games\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ongoing space exploration epic No Man\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sky, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s certainly not the only similarity between the two games, which was perhaps inevitable considering their shared theme of planetary exploration. Starfield players can use a laser to mine resources from the environment, scan indigenous lifeforms to collect zoological data, and planets can be analysed from orbit to suss out their mineral content. But of course what Starfield is adding is that rich abundance of narrative strands that Bethesda brings. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a more edgy, realistic universe. The designers call the aesthetic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nasa punk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, combining the chunky, analogue romance of early space exploration with sci-fi craft that look dented and lived-in. From looming cityscapes to rolling alien landscapes rich with flora, detail is the common theme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even if there have been controversial compromises: the game is set to run at 30fps, which has angered some players used to double that frame-rate from the Xbox Series X console. Yet it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to complain when you see things such as real-time global illumination, which dynamically colours a planet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s light levels depending on its position relative to the sun and the chemical makeup of its atmosphere. In a year that has already seen Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom provide players with an enormous undertaking, Starfield is a supermassive black hole of a game \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll suck you in and distort time. But the point, says Howard, is to give players the choice to pursue the experience they want, and to contribute to the universe. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We like to make games that reward players for their time investment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to give people that freedom. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s special about video games as entertainment. We feel with Starfield, more than anything we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done, the more you give to it, the more it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gonna give back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Keith Stuart attended a press trip to the Xbox showcase in Los Angeles with other journalists.

Twelve other divers and 14 crew, including the captain of the Hurricane, were rescued after abandoning the ship on Sunday morning. The group had sailed out to Elphinstone reef, a famed diving spot roughly 12km offshore and 30km from the resort town of Marsa Alam. According to the tour operator Scuba Travel and Tornado Marine Fleet, which operated the diving boat, a fire broke out onboard at 8.30am local time during a diving briefing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is with great regret that we, as the tour operator, with heavy hearts, must accept that three of our much-valued dive guests who had not participated in the dive briefing, early on the morning of June 11, perished in the tragic incident,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Pat Adamson, a spokesperson for Scuba Travel, the British company that arranged the trip. Mohamed Bendary, the secretary general of Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Red Sea governorate, stated that preliminary investigations suggested the blaze began in the boat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s engine room. The Hurricane is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liveabord\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd vessel, designed to accommodate tourists for days at a time. When the fire occurred, the group had arranged to stay on the boat for a week. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At the time the fire broke out 12 divers were participating in a briefing onboard, while those missing had apparently decided not to dive that morning. The severity of the fire meant that the 12 divers were immediately evacuated by boat to another craft nearby and the 14 crew members, including the captain and two dive guides, having tried to reach the missing guests, also had to abandon ship and were rescued,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Adamson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The dive boat Hurricane is currently being towed to a port, yet to be nominated, as the vessel is still smouldering with cooling required before entry,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Adamson. Footage of the boat off the coast of the resort town of Marsa Alam showed fire engulfing both decks of the ship as smoke billowed into the air. He added that Tornado Marine Fleet had maintained a strong safety record with Scuba UK. Tornado Marine Fleet, a company based in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el Sheikh offering trips onboard liveabord vessels, previously confirmed the incident and ongoing investigations, but did not respond when contacted concerning the deaths onboard the Hurricane or to discuss details of the vessel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s safety record. In recent posts on Facebook, the company offered last-minute spaces onboard the Hurricane for diving excursions in the Red Sea in May and June. Pictures of the interior of the boat showed luxurious cabins with wood floors and walls, a dining room and living room lined with velvet banquettes and an onboard chef. The 12 rescued divers were taken to Marsa Shagra, a village north of Marsa Alam, where they received medical attention and gave statements to police, as local authorities pledged to investigate the cause of the fire. Scuba UK said the group was receiving consular assistance to return to the UK, after all of their personal possessions including passports were destroyed in the fire onboard the Hurricane. The Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office has been contacted for comment. Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Red Sea resorts harbour some of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most renowned beach destinations and are popular with holidaymakers.

Moves! in the brilliant channels of the wind Shines! its polished shafts and feathered fronds ensconced there colorless beyond all feeling This is the principle of the godly, fluted, a statue tall and pale \u00e2\u20ac\u201d lifeless save only in beauty, the kernel of all seeking, the eternal William Carlos Williams (1883-1963) writes with an intriguing combination of physicality and abstraction in The Province. From his 1948 collection, The Clouds, Aigeltinger, Russia, it seems at first almost to promise another imagist classic to set beside The Red Wheelbarrow. It sets out in the characteristic Williams manner, so alert that, whatever object or life-form he is observing, the image seems to fill the page with its exactly caught but changing motion and presence. Perhaps, though, even at the start of this poem, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already a distancing effect belonging to the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153figure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The grass has acquired an abstract shape, included with other connotations of figure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the human, the mathematical. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not until the penultimate stanza that the figure is shown clearly to be related to the statue, and the tall sheaf of grass becomes fixed in a version of the iconic. First, although the grass \u00e2\u20ac\u0153keeps its alignment faultlessly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subject to the effects of the wind and the light, an outdoors plant in an unidealised location \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by the cinder-bank\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In fact, Williams seems to interrupt the reader and himself when, defying the full-stop after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153faultlessly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he begins a new line and sentence with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moves!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and adds the exclamation mark to insist on the excitement of his observation. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s another side of the writer, of course, to express jubilation and intensity, to let feeling flow over the sides of exactly rendered observation. There are more than ideas in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153things\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: there is often the delighted and abundant responsiveness to their effect. So the grass \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moves! / in the brilliant / channels / of the wind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the brevity of these lines does nothing to restrict that sense of fluidity. With the second verse, the excitement seems to accumulate: the grass, perhaps standing still now, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shines!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Williams picks out a significant contrast of texture in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153polished / shafts / and feathered / fronds / ensconced there\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feathered fronds\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd seem vulnerable, the part of the plant which would carry forward its seeding, and which the plant itself \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ensconces\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and protects. Then comes the reminder: the grass is white, not green with life. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153colorless / beyond all feeling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. From this point on, the poem encompasses abstraction, though not yet entirely: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the principle / of the godly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is given concrete shape, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fluted, a / statue / tall and pale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The statue is an analogy, suggested by the tall, pale grass, but it takes on a certain substantiality: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fluted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd might suggest a representation of the flute-playing god Pan, or the carved draping of a garment. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153principle / of the godly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd seems aligned with classical aesthetic proportions. A clump of grass can exhibit these in its configuration, and elicit from an unbiased observer the true aesthetic response. Although all the verses here have arresting first lines, that of the last is the most breathtaking, as it continues, with a long dash, from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tall and pale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u201d lifeless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. What remains of the dead, dried-out grass is the formula of its beauty, and perhaps there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a suggestion of something lifeless in beauty itself as a governing principle. Despite the reference to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the eternal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surely no Wordsworthian intimation of immortality in Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perception in the last verse. He is simply outlining a human quest that has no time limit, and applies to everyone alive to the world as well as to the makers of art: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the kernel / of all seeking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is beauty. Williams is a poet who celebrates the idea of the province, but perhaps the poem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s title hints that, while a provincial environment may produce beauty equal to that found in cities and their institutions, it is not a superior beauty. Neither is superior: the underlying principle remains the same. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The Province is from Volume II of William Carlos Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Collected Poems (1939-1962) published, together with Volume 1, by Carcanet. Williams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s major poem Paterson is a recent, welcome addition to the trio."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/12/lost-job-learn-code-ai-humans-skills", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "When I lost my job, I learned to code.

Eventually, the fun began to wear off and in an act of subversive defiance (or cowardly resignation), I took their goading advice, learned to code and pivoted to what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hoped would be a far more secure career in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153web development\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, only for recent advances in AI to supposedly render coding jobs a waste of time, too. It seems I have accidentally timed my career change to coincide with a mass rollout of AI chatbots that have also learned to code, and that are \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in many respects \u00e2\u20ac\u201c already far better at it than me. Code can appear alarming to the uninitiated: inscrutable \u00e2\u20ac\u0153languages\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that mostly read like a calculator having a stroke, but, according to AI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most fervent evangelists, they no longer need represent any barrier at all. Why bother wrapping your head around the needlessly convoluted nerdspeak required to display white text on a black background, when you can now simply ask a chatbot to do this in layperson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s terms and it will promptly serve up your code, complete with instructions? Playing around with various chatbots, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll still experience the AI making a fair amount of mistakes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which a working knowledge of code helps correct \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but you can also just talk these through with the AI, and it will attempt to solve them for you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not difficult to envisage a not too distant future where they can discern users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 needs and walk them through solutions, the role of a human developer seemingly consigned to history. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tempting to succumb to the fatalism around AI job theft here. The technology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loudest cheerleaders are themselves the most eager to cultivate it, encouraging us to surrender to a robotic new dawn, where devoting the time to learn skills, perform tasks or know about anything may as well be considered a thing of the past. But it fundamentally confuses the ability to shortcut how to do something with developing a full understanding of why you would. AI chatbots haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t broken some omert\u00c3\u00a0 around coding. They have simply digested a load of resources and open-source materials that were already made freely available online for human beings to learn from. A user could attempt to skip this phase by leveraging a chatbot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grasp of this knowledge, but in doing so, would forfeit ever grasping what decisions the machine was making on their behalf, why it was making them, whether they were even any good and, crucially, what else was possible. One of the most gratifying aspects of web design and development is the lateral thinking involved. There is rarely ever an objective and singular correct way to go about achieving something. You have to consider all the different contexts a user will encounter on your site, how you want them to interact with it, what you want to elicit in them, whether what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve put together will make their phone immediately overheat and explode, killing them instantly, and so on. A machine trained to aggregate and condense the entire web to its most predictable forms doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think like this, and neither does a user reliant on one. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been fortunate enough to carve out a practice working on projects where I have been hired not just because I possess coding knowledge the client doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, nor for my creative ideas, but for the combination of the two, and how they inform one another. As well as having been professionally fruitful to learn to code, I also \u00e2\u20ac\u201c regrettably, given how I was browbeaten into it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c actually \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 enjoy it? The rush when a harebrained idea improbably works is like nothing else. I unironically think and say things like: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe in the capacity for the browser to be an absurdly creative and innovative medium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There are projects I endeavour to make, whether someone pays me or not. And while AI may diminish certain aspects of my earning power, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not about to have such a low opinion of my craft that I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s essentially the same as typing a command into a chat box. Nobody should. And yet there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a concerted effort on the part of Silicon Valley to make us believe that the human mind is predictable, replicable and unsophisticated, and that the arts and adjacent sectors are reducible to a set of equations and keywords, because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve spent billions creating machines that can now knock out forgeries of creative endeavour and mildly amusing images of Harry Potter characters wearing Balenciaga. Asked about potential use cases for AI, OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT) co-founder Greg Brockman gave a revealing prediction about what he saw as the future of entertainment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are still upset about the last season of Game of Thrones, but imagine if you could ask your AI to make a new ending that goes a different way, and maybe even put yourself in there as a main character.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ability for people to do this has already existed since time immemorial, inside of their own heads. It speaks to such a paucity of imagination on the part of AI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exponents that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re asking us to imagine having an imagination. Such people cannot conceive of deriving enjoyment and gratification from creating art, or why someone would prefer to craft their own stories instead of outsourcing the entire process to a machine. They lack even the basic conviction in their own ideas to come up with Game of Thrones fan fiction without asking a computer to do their homework. The heaviest salivating around the potential of AI is coming from those who see it as an exciting costcutting measure that might allow capital to finally become unshackled from its old adversary, labour. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absurd nonsense to suggest that humanity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective recorded cultural output has been essentially concluded, bottled and corked at this specific point in history, that it was all merely fodder and data points for training AI models which will take it from here, cheers. Ingesting every piece of art ever into a machine which lovelessly boils them down to some approximated median result isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t artistic expression. It may be a neat parlour trick, a fun novelty, but an AI is only able to produce semi-convincing knock-offs of our creations precisely because real, actual people once had the thought, skill and will to create them. The spectre of AI will be used as a threat and a cudgel by those who see creative pursuit as only possessing worth if it can be monetised, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wrong. A machine has no capacity for self-expression, no compulsion to communicate: this is who I was, this is how I felt and this is what I stood for. We do, and in all of our endeavours we need to start refusing attempts to make us forget how valuable our humanity really is.

Thirteen-year-old Lesly Mukutuy was able to identify edible fruits, find suitable water and avoid dangerous plants and animals thanks in part to knowledge handed down to her from her grandmother, Fatima Valencia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have to recognise not only her bravery but also her leadership,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the minister of defence, Iv\u00c3\u00a1n Vel\u00c3\u00a1squez, said on Sunday after a visit to Bogot\u00c3\u00a1\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military hospital, where the children are being treated for malnutrition and minor injuries. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We can say that it was because of her that her three younger siblings could survive by her side, thanks to her care and her knowledge of the jungle.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A Cessna carrying the four children, their mother and two other adults including the pilot crashed in one of Colombia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most remote and dangerous regions on 1 May. A search team found the plane on 16 May in a thick patch of the rainforest and recovered the bodies of the adults but the children were nowhere to be found. On Friday the four children \u00e2\u20ac\u201c members of the Huitoto Indigenous community \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were found in a small jungle clearing 3 miles (5km) from the wreckage, in an area where snakes, mosquitoes and other animals abound. Several times search teams had passed within 50 metres of the clearing. They were finally able to pin the children down thanks to a cry from Cristin, the youngest of the siblings. He was just 11 months old when the plane came down while the children were travelling with their mother from the Amazonian village of Araracuara to San Jos\u00c3\u00a9 del Guaviare. The children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great-uncle, Fidencio Valencia, said the siblings had survived by eating fari\u00c3\u00b1a, or cassava flour, and by using their knowledge of the rainforest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fruits. So far the children have given few details of their ordeal, but conversations with family members suggest they have may have hid from the search team out of fear. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were afraid out there, with the dogs barking,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Fidencio Valencia, having spoken to the children on Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They hid among the trees \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 they ran.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Valencia told the media outlet Noticias Caracol that the children were starting to talk and one of them said they hid in tree trunks to protect themselves. Alicia M\u00c3\u00a9ndez, a journalist with the newspaper El Tiempo, said that one point the children had heard a message in their native language recorded by Fatima Valencia and transmitted from a helicopter, but they were scared to respond. Henry Guerrero, an Indigenous man who was part of the search group, told reporters that the children were found with two small bags containing some clothes, a towel, a torch, two mobile phones, a music box and a drink bottle. He said they used the bottle to collect water in the jungle, adding that after they were rescued the youngsters complained of being hungry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They wanted to eat rice pudding, they wanted to eat bread,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Aside from the shock and trauma of the crash and their mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, the children may have had reason to fear the olive uniforms of the search party. Manuel Ranoque, father of the two younger children, claims that members of the Carolina Ramir\u00c3\u00a9z Front, an ex-Farc dissident group active in the region, had a history of threatening him and his family. Ranoque, who served as governor of a Huitoto community, said the threats had forced him to leave the region to Araracuara, in Caquet\u00c3\u00a1 in Colombia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern Amazon region. The family had visited Ranoque there in April and were returning to San Jos\u00c3\u00a9 de Guaviare in a chartered Cessna when the engine failed and crashed into a region where the rebel group operate. On 20 May the army confirmed it had found an abandoned Farc dissident camp 2.8km from the crash site but quickly ruled out speculation that the children had been kidnapped by the group. Ranoque said the children would tell their own stories in time. No one can accuse the military of not doing enough to find the siblings. They used 11 aircraft, distributed 10,000 flyers and launched 100 food kits into the search area of 323 sq km, even at distances further than the children could have been expected to reach on foot. More than 150 soldiers and 200 volunteers from local Indigenous communities and a team of 10 Belgian shepherd dogs took part in the search. At first the troops from the Colombian special forces acted silently, accustomed to tracking down rebel groups in the jungle. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We realised we had to modify the procedure, to make noise and call Lesly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name, to make them see us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a soldier involved in the rescue told El Mundo on condition of anonymity. Of the Indigenous volunteers, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They taught us about the jungle, their traditions and their deep spirituality.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was perhaps telling that the first people to find the children were members of the Indigenous search team, who had been calling out in native languages. On the morning of the rescue they partook in a ritual with yag\u00c3\u00a9 (ayahuasca), a traditional jungle medicine with psychedelic properties. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were found by an Indigenous guardian who took yag\u00c3\u00a9 and with the support of the army\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technology,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Luis Acosta, coordinator of the Guardia Indigina. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those who take yag\u00c3\u00a9 see far beyond what we see. He becomes a doctor, a panther, a tiger a puma. He sees beyond because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a holistic medicine. He had the capacity to look.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking on Saturday, Fatima Valencia also credited the spiritual and natural worlds for her grandchildren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s survival. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I give thanks to Mother Earth, because she released them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/berlusconi-death-legacy-loss-of-faith-in-italy-political-elite", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Bunga bunga and bling aside, Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legacy is a loss of faith in Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political elite", "lead": "One of European politics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 most controversial figures, his career was marked by tawdry sex and corruption scandals", "author": "Jon Henley Europe correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T08:57:09Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764232", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/619b252dc12f18bd2f17262744842b06b685ed6d/0_143_4096_2457/500.jpg", "body": "Best known for his perma-tan, gaffes, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bunga bunga\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd parties and outsized ego, Silvio Berlusconi was a proto-Trumpian populist, the man to beat in Rome for more than two decades, and one of European politics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 most controversial figures. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longest-serving postwar prime minister, Berlusconi, who has died aged 86 according to Italian media, held the job on three occasions, amassing along the way a fortune ranked by Forbes magazine last year as the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fourth-biggest. Skilled in the art of not just weathering scandal but emerging from it with his profile and popularity enhanced, he faced prosecution more than 30 times on charges including embezzlement, false accounting and bribing a judge. Many cases failed to go to trial, sometimes because Berlusconi changed the law under which he had been charged. Only once was he convicted, for tax fraud, in 2013. That led to a four-year prison term, of which three were pardoned, a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s community service and a six-year bar from legislative office \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from which he instantly bounced back, in 2019, as an MEP. Saying Italy needed a charismatic self-made businessman to make it great again, Berlusconi, who had dabbled in music and sung on cruise ships before building a vast personal fortune as a property developer in Milan and with his Fininvest media and TV empire, founded his conservative, pro-market Forza Italia party and entered politics in late 1993. He became prime minister in January 1994, and although his centre-right coalition government lasted barely nine months before collapsing, devoted much of his first term, according to his many critics, to passing laws and promoting policies that would protect him from prosecution and boost the profits of his private businesses. He lost the 1996 election to the centre-left leader Romano Prodi, but triumphed again in 2001 and then become the first Italian politician in 50 years to complete a full five-year mandate, before losing again to Prodi in 2006. His third term began in 2008, after Prodi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government collapsed, and ended with Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation in 2011. With Italy under IMF and EU surveillance that November, even his closest allies criticised Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reluctance to take the drastic action needed to bring Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third-largest economy under control in the wake of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s financial crisis, ushering in a technocratic government. Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public debt doubled during Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure. In his enforced six-year absence, Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics changed. The former prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voters defected en masse to Matteo Salvini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far-right Lega, which formed an uneasy coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement after the 2018 elections in which Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party scored 14% of the vote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from 37% in 2008. But the billionaire tycoon had no difficulty winning election as an MEP and returned to the national fray last year when Forza Italia entered an uneasy far-right led coalition with Giorgia Meloni\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brothers of Italy and Salvini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Lega. Reinforcing a career-long reputation for jaw-dropping gaffes and outrageous asides, he subsequently called Meloni \u00e2\u20ac\u0153patronising, overbearing, arrogant and offensive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, boasted of his close ties with Vladimir Putin, and claimed Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was to blame for his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devastation. No one should have been overly surprised: among many other politically incorrect sallies, Berlusconi also suggested the German centre-left politician Martin Schulz could play a Nazi guard in a war film, reportedly called the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unfuckable lard-arse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and, in 2008, shocked many by describing then-US president-elect Barack Obama as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153handsome, young and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 suntanned\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His career was also marked by sex and related corruption scandals epitomised by lurid tales of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bunga bunga\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sex parties at his luxurious villa outside Milan, claims of unlawful sex with a 17-year old nightclub dancer, and subsequent allegations of witness-tampering. The parallels with Donald Trump are striking: both men began as real-estate magnates, became media stars and segued into politics. Both have made a point of undermining their country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s established institutions, including the press and judiciary. Rejected by their respective liberal establishments, both also have responded \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite their great wealth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the populist tactic of portraying themselves as the true voice of the people against an out-of-touch and corrupt elite. Throughout his political career, Berlusconi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance of the Italian media \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including ownership of three television channels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c drew justifiable accusations of conflict of interest and excess of influence. It would be wrong, however, to conclude that this was the sole explanation for his enduring success. The reason Berlusconi was constantly re-elected (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bastava non votarlo,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd his opponents would endlessly lament: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All you have to do is not vote for him\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) is that he represented a part of Italy that places money and power above justice and ethics. His legacy is likely to be not the bunga bunga parties, the bling and the vulgarity, but the Italian electorate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loss of faith in their political class \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a loss that has led, ironically, to the emergence of a new generation of altogether more radical, and harder-right, populist politicians."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2023/jun/12/ten-people-killed-in-bus-crash-near-greta-in-nsw-hunter-valley-follow-updates", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Driver charged over bus crash that killed 10 in wedding party \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "Follow latest updates", "author": "Royce Kurmelovs (now) and Caitlin Cassidy (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T08:29:40Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764236", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ef217bf5f1111725130bed5cb7f508d9a2591a29/0_365_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Goodnight from us We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be wrapping up the live blog for the day now.

Goodnight and stay safe The driver of a bus that crashed in the Hunter Valley killing 10 people has now been charged. NSW Police say the 58-year-old man has been charged with 10 counts of dangerous driving occasioning death, driving in a dangerous manner and negligent driving (occasioning death). The Maitland man was refused bail and will appear at Cessnock local court on Tuesday morning. Acting assistant commissioner David Waddell will hold a press conference outside the Cessnock police station on Tuesday morning at 8am. Here is a shot from the latest press conference by Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s photographer-at-large Mike Bowers, who has been on the ground in the Hunter with Natasha May this afternoon. Chapman: police in the process of removing bodies from the wreckage Tracy Chapman says investigators also believe they have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an understanding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of those unaccounted for and are currently speaking to family members to identify all those involved. Chapman says that it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153her understanding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there were 36 people on the bus, including the driver. Ten people were killed in the accident, another 25 were transported to hospital. Some have since been released. Chapman says bus has now been righted in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdelicate\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 operation Acting assistant police commissioner Tracy Chapman says the bus has now been righted in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153delicate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd operation, as there were still victims\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 bodies in the bus. She also provided more information about what occurred during the accident. As you can imagine it was a fairly frantic scene. A number of passengers were able to be extracted through the front windscreen of the bus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then to deal with those in terms of that triage process with New South Wales ambulance. Webb: driver \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctaken for mandatory testing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for alcohol Karen Webb says that one of the issues to be determined is whether all the passengers onboard the bus were waiting seatbelts at the time of the accident. Webb also said the driver had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taken for mandatory testing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to determine whether alcohol was a factor but the results are not yet known. Karen Webb: The most complex part of this job ahead for police now is actually accounting for the victims and passengers on the bus. You can imagine the scene that was confronting police when they attended and that many of those people were treated [and] some people were transported to different locations and then re-diverted. Catley says the officers and first responders who have been involved in the investigation and the response will receive additional support. There will be wrap-around services for you as well but we will make sure that you get that. Police minister expresses sympathy for families and victims of Hunter bus crash Yasmin Catley: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfathomable that we are here today on the end of our long weekend. And I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t express deeply enough how saddened I feel for the families, for the community, for the first responders, for everybody involved. I mean, none of us want to be here during this, today. It is clearly just shocked. What has occurred is unnecessary. Karen Webb says police are still \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the charging process\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but is otherwise unable to say what the charges are. As soon as we have that information we will share with you. Webb says that the site is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153still an active crime scene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that is currently being investigated. I would also like this opportunity to praise all of the police officers and support staff that have been working on this scene around the clock, not just at the scene but also at the hospitals.

He said the entire community has been devastated since waking up to the news. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect to hear this anywhere in Australia, let alone here in the Hunter Valley, which is the one of the most picturesque places in the world. And then to have this happen and wake up to 10 deaths and lots of people in hospital, like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just something that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever think of will happen here. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s devastating for the families and the loved ones and everyone, friends are all involved, and these people that have passed away. Everyone who has been in the Hunter at some stage has been on the bus, because that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what we do here. We have buses so that people can go to these venues and have good days out and do good tastings and things like that in the area. Bus crash press conference to come \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It is understood acting assistant police commissioner Tracy Chapman will be speaking at a press conference at 3pm. It will be the second for the day. We will bring you the latest as it happens.

Bainbridge, a Branxton local, said she was up late last night watching a movie when she heard \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all the sirens and all the commotion going on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But then it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t until she woke up in the morning that she found out what had been their cause. It was really sad just to see what happened, especially on such an amazing day for such an amazing couple, this tragedy. Sarnelli, from Singleton, said she hopes the bride, the groom and the family are doing OK, as well as that the people in hospital make it out OK. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just very scary to know that like, people from your community, this is what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll definitely be talked about a lot. I think a lot of us will sit there and commemorate these people. We just have to be with everyone in the community and hold hands and make sure we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all keeping each other safe during this time. Bainbridge said although the community still didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know exactly who has been injured, everyone in the local community has been taking to social media to express their support amid the tragedy. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so many people sending their condolences out, even when we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know who was involved in the accident, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hurt, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not, but so many people are already reaching out to everyone sending their love, sending condolences. Transport for NSW secretary Howard Collins releases statement on bus crash Everyone at Transport for NSW offers their deepest condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of those who have lost their lives or been injured in the tragic bus crash in the Hunter Valley overnight. We also extend our sympathies to everyone dealing with this tragedy, and thank the frontline emergency services, medical teams - both onsite and in hospitals - and our own staff who are on location assisting with operations. Transport for NSW continues to support emergency services at the scene with Traffic Commanders and other staff on site. We will be providing specialist trauma support to our staff and assisting transport operators as required during this difficult time. Transport for NSW advises everyone travelling today to avoid the area as investigations will continue for some time. Information on road closures will be available at livetraffic.com The groom, Mitchell Gaffney, previously played for the club when he lived in Victoria, prior to moving north. Club president Royce Jaksic said members of the club were in shock. He said some of those associated with the club were among the injured, though not among those with life-threatening injuries. Jaksic said his thoughts were with the families of those people who had lost their lives. The information is still extremely sketchy. We are very hopeful and quite confident that none of our players and their partners have lost their lives. We probably had 13 or 14 people on the bus out of 37, for that to be the case is just a blessing. Someone was looking after them. Jaksic was not president when Gaffney was at the club. But he said it was clear his family were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly well-loved in the community\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been stalwarts in the community for a long period of time. Just goes to show that, five or six years later, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a heap of guys going up to the Hunter Valley to celebrate his wedding. So well respected, well-loved young man. Celebrant posted prior to accident about marriage of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeautiful people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The Hunter Valley celebrant who married the bride and groom prior to the tragic events of last night posted about the event on social media yesterday afternoon. She said they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beautiful people\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and was touched to see the bride drive to the ceremony in an authentic Volkswagen beetle, restored by her father. Today I had Maddy and Mitch get married out at Wandin. It was a beautiful ceremony ... I saw them for their first look ... Maddy rocked up to the ceremony in a restored 1957 Volkswagen beetle convertible. It was so cool. [Her Dad] had been holding onto it for 42 years and finally got it ready for Madeleine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wedding. They started the car up at the accommodation and drove it ... in through Wandin gates and down the grass onto the ceremony ... it was so cool to see her rock up in this bug. The ceremony was held on the grass outside at the pontoon. Following the event, the couple drove back to the pavilion in the Volkswagen. A roadblock has been set up near Branxton to control traffic around the site of the Hunter Valley bus crash. Hunter Valley bus crash may be deadliest in Australia since 1994 Details are still emerging as authorities comb the wreckage of the Hunter Valley bus crash, but it may mark the most deadly bus crash in Australia since 1994. A bus carrying 50 passengers rolled on the Gateway Motorway at Boondall in Queensland on 24 October 1994. Twelve people died in the accident which took place at 10.20am in the morning. Bus operator Linq issues statement on coach crash The operator of the bus, Linq, has issued a statement saying it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly saddened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to learn of the crash and said trauma counselling has been made available to its staff and families. The full statement reads: We are incredibly saddened to learn of the bus crash that has occurred overnight. Our hearts are with everyone involved in this terrible tragedy and we send our deepest condolences to those who have lost loved ones. We would like to thank the first responders to the scene, the emergency personnel and those who are continuing to assist. Trauma counselling services have been made available to all staff and their families at Linq Buslines. We are working with NSW police and authorities as they investigate. It would be inappropriate for us to comment further while the investigation is underway.\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf Wandin Valley Estate closed today out of respect Beyond the sandstone pillar gates of Wandin Valley Estate, the sun is shining on the lake which sprawls out behind the wedding pontoon. But those gates are closed this morning, with a laminated sign hinting at the tragedy which unfolded for the guests which left its venue after yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s celebrations: Out of respect Wandin Valley Estate will be closed today The tight-knit Hunter Valley community is reeling from last night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events, with locals confirmed to have been caught up in the crash. A wedding videographer has posted on social media, recalling filming many weddings at Wandin Estate where guests were celebrating prior to boarding the bus that was to take them to Singleton. Having filmed so many weddings at Wandin Estate ... they always have been full of fun and laughter right to very end. I cannot but feel the sadness that must be surrounding this young couple on their wedding day. I must say, that the amount of wedding vendor friends I have heard from this morning is something new. It certainly appears that this tragedy has certainly hit home to the wedding industry. A local couple drove past the outdoor wedding yesterday afternoon, and commented on how \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gorgeous the light was for them\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sobered to think that we drove past many people who were in the final hours of their lives. Wadin Estates releases statement following bus crash Wadin Estates, the venue which hosted the wedding party just before the disastrous bus accident in the Hunter Valley, has released a statement on the incident through Instagram. We are deeply saddened to hear of the bus crash overnight that has claimed the lives of some of our guests. Our heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends of the victims, and we are supporting them in any way we can. At this time, we are providing support to those guests who need our help, and we wish to maintain their privacy and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be making any further statements at this time. A few photos from the presser: The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, has given an update on the current status of those in hospital and the current numbers while on the ground in the Hunter Valley. New South Wales Health reports as of 10am this morning, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 21 patients being treated across four hospitals in New South Wales. Minns reports: One patient is in a critical condition eight patients are in a stable condition at John Hunter Hospital five patients in a stable condition at Maitland Hospital five patients are in a stable condition at Calvary matter Newcastle two patients are in a stable condition in the RPA in Sydney. Tracy Chapman says a number of people involved with the crash \u00e2\u20ac\u0153were able to free themselves and walk to get help and aid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it. Injured people are giving statements, police say Tracy Chapman says there have been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153number of victims\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Those who have been taken to hospital and are being treated and cared for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re able to identify those and speak with some of those as well. In terms of those who are deceased, we certainly have a list of people who we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still trying to account for and working through that. Of those who have been taken to hospital, 21 people are now being treated in hospital. Chapman says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some witness statements\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have been taken from those in hospital. She says she won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on whether passengers were wearing seatbelts. Assistant police commissioner says charges have not been laid at this stage Tracy Chapman says the site of the accident is being preserved \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in situ\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd while officers investigate what happened. The driver is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153still in custody\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at Cessnock police station and is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153assisting with inquiries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: At this stage no charges have been laid. Acting assistant police commissioner Tracy Chapman says the Cessnock police station\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s phone line is for family and friends of loved ones involved in the accident. She asks people not to call the police station so it can be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quarantined\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for that purpose. Chris Minns explicitly thanks emergency services who \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have no idea what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll confront before that alarm goes off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: It could be a life-changing event. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what happened this morning in New South Wales, on a Sunday night, on what was meant to be a joyous occasion, to see New South Wales police and firefighters and paramedics attend the scene is very trauma \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be traumatic for them as well. Chris Minns says he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer specific updates on the condition of the bride and groom but says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the community up here in Singleton and Cessnock have been rocked by this\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: There will be many days of healing and trauma the families go through in the coming days. The sympathies from everyone here, from the local community, and I think across New South Wales, will be with them, a day that was meant to be a joyous one, where family and friends could come together to celebrate something really special has ended in unimaginable despair. I think everyone in this state has just been truly horrified by this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s events. Sue Moore says the accident has hit the close-knit community hard: People attending a wedding and then on their way home from the wedding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so tragic. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close-knit communities of Singleton and Cessnock, people will be infected quite widely. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family, friends, first responders, everyone who has been affected by this. Jay Suuval says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this is truly a horrific day for our community\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was something that no one wanted to wake up to\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: My thoughts and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the thoughts of our community are with everyone that was involved in this accident. Their friends, their loved ones, their family. And we \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we just want to make sure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re cared for and have the support now, and also thank our emergency services, the first responders, and the people in the health system who are currently working to look after the people that have been injured in this accident. Premier Chris Minns is speaking from the site of the Hunter Valley bus accident now, telling that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whatever the final toll is \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it will be more than we can bear\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: With so much happiness and joy, came together to experience a day of joy and instead have been met with undeniable despair, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly shocking to the people of New South Wales. Minns said he has spoken with the prime minister and local mayors, Sue Moore and Jay Suvaal: The next few days and weeks may be worse than the initial shock, as it fully comes to realisation of what this community has gone through. Clearly we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been dealt a terrible, terrible accident in New South Wales this morning. Residents express shock Locals who have woken to news of the bus crash in Greta have taken to social media to express their shock. One said she had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153broken heart this morning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that the winery was a few hundred metres up her road: I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve woken to news of a horrific bus crash in the Hunter Valley about 10 minutes away from me ... so very sad. Another recalled using the roundabout where the crash occurred every Saturday to visit their father in aged care: Please drive safely. NSW premier Chris Minns has arrived in the Hunter Valley, where he has spoken to MPs and other local leaders. He is receiving a briefing from police before a press conference expected at 12.30pm AEST. We will bring you the latest as it happens. Six police vehicles line the street outside Cessnock police station Three crash investigation unit vehicles are outside Cessnock police station on this bright winter morning, alongside three other regular police vehicles. This is the station where the 58-year-old driver is being held under arrest, as NSW police\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tracy Chapman confirmed in the press conference this morning. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same station the friends and family of anyone who may have been on the bus have been told to contact. Bus company involved in accident named The bus that crashed was owned by Linq, a company that operates group charter services for weddings in the region. The company has 30 years\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 experience in the industry. Linq says on its website that its fleet is fully equipped with seatbelts. It operates 57-seat, 34-seat and 23-seat buses. The company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website says: Whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going for a day trip to the vineyards, or you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re organising transportation for your wedding guests to the ceremony and reception, we will make sure to provide a quality, luxury coach for hire in Central Coast, Newcastle and Hunter Valley, fit with air conditioning and reclining seats. Guardian Australia has approached Linq for comment but has not yet received a response. The first photos of the bus involved in the crash in the Hunter Valley are coming through. Update on road closures There are a number of road closures after the crash, with police expecting investigations will take some time. At Greta, Wine Country Drive between New England Highway and Bridge Street is closed. The northbound and southbound offramps from Hunter Expressway to Wine Country Drive are also closed. You can get the latest updates here. The state minister for regional transport and roads, Jenny Aitchison, posted: Emergency services are on scene and there are road closures and diversions in place so please avoid the area. One of injured in a critical condition We have an update on the state of 21 patients being treated across four hospitals in New South Wales. One is in a critical condition at John Hunter hospital in Newcastle. A further eight are in stable conditions at the hospital, five are stable at Maitland hospital, five are stable at Calvary Mater in Newcastle and two are in a stable condition at the Royal Prince Alfred hospital in Sydney. Police said 25 people were taken to hospital after the crash, so it is likely four have been discharged but we are seeking to confirm this now. When NSW Police gave a press conference earlier this morning, the bus was still on its side in the roundabout where it crashed. As you can see in this aerial shot, there are many emergency services on the scene working around the clock. This is a distressing story. As the prime minister told Australians earlier, for those who need assistance, Lifeline is as always available on 13 11 14. Take care of yourselves today. Our NSW correspondent Tamsin Rose has informed me that the premier, Chris Minns, is heading to the Hunter Valley now. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to hold a press conference about 1pm. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a lot of lives shattered out of this\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Nationals leader David Littleproud appeared on Sky News earlier. He said the crash demonstrated \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the fragility of life\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no words or comfort myself, the prime minister or anybody can give families today. This is pure grief that they will have to endure. But they should know that this country will wrap its arms around and know that that pain is one that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shared. Littleproud said small communities in the Hunter Valley were connected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153from the wineries right through to the bus companies themselves\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got to understand, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be a lot of lives shattered out of this \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 small country towns, small regional communities, bear the brunt of this because invariably there is that emotional connection of knowing somebody. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLives changed forever\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Federal member for Riverina and former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack has posted on social media: Lives lost, lives changed forever for those left to mourn. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDeeply saddened\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Yasmin Catley, MP for Swansea, says she is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply saddened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the news. Swansea is about an hour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drive south from Greta, the small town where the crash occurred: I know that our Hunter community will be shocked and saddened by the news they are waking up to this morning. I send my deepest condolences to the families, friends, and loved ones of those who have been killed and those who were injured in this tragic accident. I would like to thank our first responders for their rapid response to this incident last night, including the NSW Police Force, NSW Ambulance, and NSW Fire and Rescue, as well as staff at NSW Health and Transport for NSW. You can watch Tracy Chapman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s press conference here: MPs are continuing to take to social media to express condolences to loved ones. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAustralia wraps its arms around you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The PM reminds people worried about family or friends to contact Cessnock police station on 02 4991 0199, while those with information have been urged to contact Crime Stoppers: The police have asked respectfully that we keep the Cessnock police lines open for the family and friends. For those who need assistance, Lifeline is as always available on 13 11 14. My government will provide whatever support is necessary to the families as details become clearer. For now, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking of you, Australia wraps its arms around you and Australians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hopes and prayers are with you on this tragic day. Thank you. PM thanks first responders and health staff Anthony Albanese offers thanks to first responders who arrived at the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrible scene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t imagine what they were confronted with, what they had to deal with. But they did as they always did \u00e2\u20ac\u201ctheir job. They did their best looking after people, trying to do their best to save lives, and to assist in the recovery at this horrific scene. So, to them, to the doctors and nurses, to the police and emergency services, to those who transported the injured to hospital, I say once again, thank you. I say also thank you to those people who will continue to assist in the days, weeks, months and years ahead. The mental scars of this will not go away. They are there forever and we need to make sure that when the spotlight leaves the care doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, for people who have witnessed this and for people who have experienced this tragedy firsthand. Anthony Albanese spoke to the local member Dan Repacholi and premier Chris Minns this morning, he confirms. Repacholi, who I spoke with this morning, as well as the premier Chris Minns, he said earlier, and he was right \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Hunter is a tight-knit community and anyone who has been up there knows that is absolutely right. And he has had confirmed that there are certainly locals involved as well in this tragedy. Anthony Albanese says people hire buses for weddings \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in order to keep their guests safe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: That just adds to the unimaginable nature of this tragedy. All Australians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 thoughts go out to the family, friends and loved ones of those we lost in such horrific circumstances. And to all those 25 in hospital \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking of you and sending our best wishes for a recovery. The prime minister is speaking now in Canberra. All of us know the joy of going to a wedding, a chance to celebrate dear friends and family. They are some of the happiest times that you can have. For a joyous day like that in a beautiful place to end with such terrible loss of life and injury is so cruel and so sad and so unfair. Federal member for Hunter Dan Repacholi has arrived at the site and is liaising with detective inspector Matt Zimmer. As mentioned earlier, he lives just a 15 minute drive away from where the fatal tragedy occurred. Repacholi said he had never seen an incident on the section of road where the bus crashed overnight. He described the crash as devastating and offered his condolences. He said he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d travelled the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s roads extensively and told Nine: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know of any issues on this particular section of road at all. I travel these roads and do thousands of kilometres a week in this area and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen an incident on this road.v Community members are arriving near the scene of the bus crash to lay flowers. Locals Kim and John Greko told ABC News: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just way too close to home \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and a wedding, one of the happiest days of your life turns into one of the most tragic \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 all we can do is to say we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking of the families. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to front the media in about 15 minutes. Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales, has released a statement: The bus was returning from a wedding at a local winery. Police have confirmed 10 people have died, 11 have been taken to hospital and a further 18 are uninjured. I extend my deepest condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of those who have been killed in this accident and those who are injured. This is a profoundly tragic event. I know the whole community of NSW, and in particular the people of the Hunter, will be shocked and saddened to wake up to this news today. He thanks emergency services personnel and agencies for their response overnight and today: Support is being offered to those impacted by this tragedy. Investigations into the circumstances of the accident have commenced, led by NSW Police. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a reminder of how fragile our lives are\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Clayton Barr, the NSW state member for Cessnock, said the roundabout in question was typically well-lit and had a good road surface. It is used to access the Hunter Expressway to Newcastle and to the Upper Hunter. It is a major roundabout used daily by locals and tourists visiting the region. Barr told Nine: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredibly well-lit area, the road surface is terrific. It was on a roundabout, the bus couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been doing any more than 20-30km/h. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a reminder of how fragile our lives are when we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out on the road really. Simple things, small things. Police are yet to say anything about the cause of the crash and it is not known how fast the bus was travelling. New South Wales roads minister Jenny Aitchison said the state was in shock after the horror bus crash in the Hunter Valley overnight. Speaking to 2GB, she described the response of emergency services as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amazing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This has been going on since 11.30pm last night. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had people airlifted to hospitals in Sydney and right across the Hunter. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a massive effort and of course my condolences and sympathies go out to the families and the friends of these people, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just such a tragic time and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking of them. Witnesses urged to call Crime Stoppers NSW police have issued a further statement calling for assistance in identifying the victims of the crash: Police are still working to identify the crash victims and contact their next of kin. Family and friends of a person who may have been on board the bus are urged to contact Cessnock Police Station on 02 4991 0199. Witnesses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or anyone with information relevant to the circumstances surrounding the crash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 to keep the line to Cessnock Police Station clear for concerned family members. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThere are a lot of roadworks in and about that area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 New South Wales member for the Upper Hunter Dave Layzell, who was speaking on ABC News Breakfast earlier, confirmed there were several roadworks in the area at the time and much of the road had a speed limit of 40km/h: The roundabout it is a very large roundabout \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] a lot of land development going on there at the moment, and there are a lot of roadworks in and about that area around the roundabout itself. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcDeeply saddened\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The Today show journalist Lara Vella is in the Hunter Valley. This is the statement she has received from the winery where guests were celebrating before the crash. The winery is yet to post a public statement. The police press conference has just concluded. To recap: Ten people have died and 25 people have been injured in the bus crash, which occurred at a roundabout on Wine Country Drive near Greta about 11.30pm. The coach remains on its side, and victims of the crash are yet to have been removed. Families are continuing to be contacted. There is a possibility more people may still be trapped under the bus. The driver of the bus, a 58-year-old man, has been arrested and is at Cessnock police station. He has not been seriously injured and police believe there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sufficient information\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for him to be arrested. Two people were airlifted to hospital, with the rest of the injured taken to nearby hospitals by road. No children are understood to have been involved in the crash. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the ages of the victims. The people on the bus were travelling to Singleton to their accommodation after celebrating a wedding. Police are still trying to identify all of the people on the bus. If you have friends or family who may have been there, contact Cessnock police station. If you have any information about the crash, contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Tracy Chapman says the people travelling on the bus were heading to their accommodation in Singleton, about a 20-minute drive from Greta, after the wedding. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt was a confronting and very traumatic scene\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Two people were airlifted out after the crash, Chapman says, with the majority taken by road to nearby hospitals. She can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on who was the first to arrive on the scene but acknowledges it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153confronting and very traumatic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tragic set of circumstances. The number of family members, but broader community, who will be impacted by this, you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count. From a policing perspective, our role is to make sure that we undertake a full and thorough investigation to ensure that some comfort may be given to those family members and the public at the conclusion of that investigation and that process. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m aware it was a confronting and very traumatic scene. Wherever you have got that large-scale incident with that many people, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be difficult for anyone. So our thoughts are with police and all first responders who attended. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe will look at all avenues\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Tracy Chapman says her understanding is it was a single-vehicle collision. She doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment as to whether speed was a factor in the crash, for which there has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sufficient information\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to arrest the driver: Our investigation and information at this stage indicate that it is a single-vehicle collision but obviously as we work through that scene and obtain any other information that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s available from witnesses or from what the scene presents, then we will look at all avenues. Bodies remain at the site The victims of the crash have not been removed from the site, Chapman says: We have family liaison officers who will be assigned to families to work with them and ensure that they have the support and welfare around them that they need \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the deceased have not been removed. Of the 25 people being treated in hospital, she says injuries vary and she can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t elaborate on them. She says it is her understanding no children have been injured in the crash. Chapman says she is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not aware\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if the driver, who is at Cessnock police station, is injured but if he was, they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very minor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd injuries not warranting hospitalisation. Victims could still be trapped under bus Tracy Chapman says it is possible victims of the crash are still trapped under the bus. She says she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t elaborate on whether the death toll will rise but \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly the bus is still on its side and yet to be righted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: There are also people who are still injured in hospital, at least two of which were airlifted and so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always a possibility that that number may increase. Reporter: So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a potential that people could still be trapped under that bus as you try to work? Chapman: There is that potential, yes. Driver arrested To reiterate, the driver of the vehicle is under arrest. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been the driver of a motor vehicle collision where there have been fatal injuries and there will be charges pending. Asked what sort of charges, Chapman says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too early to go into any of those issues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Reporter: Assistant commissioner, I understand it is very early in the investigation, but it is unusual for you to be able to say that he will be facing charges as opposed to being under guard. What information can you provide that would suggest that he will be charged and why will he be charged? Chapman: There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sufficient information, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the driver of a motor vehicle, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sufficient information for us to establish that there will be charges, but I but I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go into the detail about those at this stage. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe are still trying to identify all of the people on the bus\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Tracy Chapman says a crime scene has been established and is being forensically examined by the crash investigation unit and and specialist police: If there are friends or family of anyone who may have been on that bus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are still trying to identify all of the people on the bus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they can contact Cessnock police station. If there are people with information in relation to the accident, they should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. I urge people with information to contact Crime Stoppers rather than Cessnock police station in order to leave those lines open for friends and family. New South Wales police\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tracy Chapman is speaking now. She confirms 10 people have died and 25 have been taken to hospital with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153varying injuries\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The driver of the coach, a 58-year-old man, is under arrest: Good morning on a very difficult morning and some tragic circumstances. At approximately 11.30pm last night, emergency services were called to the roundabout on Wine Country Drive just near the Hunter Expressway offramp in relation to a motor vehicle collision. Upon arrival, it was identified that a coach had overturned on that roundabout and at this stage it appeared to be a single-vehicle collision \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 there are 10 people confirmed deceased and a further 25 people have been transported to hospital and at this stage, they have varying injuries. A 58-year-old man, the driver of the coach, was taken to hospital for mandatory testing and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now at Cessnock police station and currently under arrest. Site was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthick with fog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hours earlier Dave Layzell passed through the crash site just hours before the rollover occurred, and says it was thick with fog. The area \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [is] one of the links off the expressway, into the wine region and down Wine Country Drive, it allows you to connect up to the major centres \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it was an area that I went through just a few hours earlier, ironically, and it was thick with fog and very, you know, very hard driving conditions when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got that thick fog around. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe pride ourselves on the ability to show people a good time\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 New South Wales member for the Upper Hunter Dave Layzell is appearing now on ABC News Breakfast. He says the tragedy took place after a packed weekend of festivals and events: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely devastating news \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this is a real tragedy. Our area, we pride ourselves on the ability to show people a good time, lots of weddings, lots of vineyards, a lot of short breaks out of Sydney, out of Newcastle. We were just last week celebrating \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what a great area we have created, what a great tourist destination and for this to happen at the end of what has been a huge weekend of local festivals, a lot of local fun, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just tragic. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA terrible tragedy after the joy of a wedding,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Dutton says The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has offered his support to the injured and families of those who have lost loved ones in the crash: A terrible tragedy after the joy of a wedding. Roadblocks surround crash site Images are beginning to come in from the blocked road at Wine Country Drive, Greta, the site of the horrific bus crash. Police have confirmed at least 10 people have been killed, with others taken to hospitals across the region. A look at Wandin Estate It is being reported that victims of the crash were celebrating a wedding at Wandin Estate in Lovedale before the tragedy occurred. The Hunter Valley is a hugely popular winery region and wedding site, with dozens of locations across the region. Wandin Estate is set among 120 acres of vineyards, lawns and bushland. The local mayor, Jay Suvaal, said: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a major tourist destination. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been many people from across the country that have done similar things to this. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure be sending their love and well wishes along to the people involved in this as well. Police press conference expected soon Earlier, we reported there would be a NSW police media conference this morning to update the community on the crash. We can confirm acting deputy commissioner Brett Greentree and acting assistant commissioner Tracy Chapman will be up in about half an hour at Branxton, the site of the crash: Senior police will address the media after 10 people died and multiple others were injured in a bus crash at Greta, in the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hunter region overnight. Ambulance inspector audio played Sydney radio station 2GB has played audio from the emergency services scanner in which a NSW ambulance inspector can be heard describing the bus crash as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major incident\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multiple patients\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and asking for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all resources\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to help. The inspector refers to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seven code fours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, referring to seven deaths. That toll has since risen. The inspector is recorded as saying: Major incident declared, we have a bus rollover, multiple patients. The exact location is on Wine Country Drive overpass, we have police, fire brigade on scene. At this stage we have identified seven, I repeat seven, code fours. We have multiple red and orange label patients at this stage. I need all resources allocated to continue, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still trying to work out exactly how many patients I have here. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has offered his thoughts to the loved ones of those killed in the crash, and those who have been injured. Praise for paramedics The paramedics who attended the scene have been praised for their efforts to save the bus passengers. Paula Sinclair, of NSW Ambulance, told Channel Seven that police were working to liaise and notify families of the wedding guests. She said her thoughts go out to the affected families, and her paramedics did a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fantastic job under the circumstances\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Whilst they are paramedics every day of their lives, something like this is not a job they go to every day. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m incredibly proud of all the paramedics that attended, they did a fantastic job under the circumstances. No doubt they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be reflecting and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll make sure we have the right supports for them available as well. First responders thanked Asked if he would visit the site of the crash, Dan Repacholi says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll talk to people in the area, including first responders he knows personally: And the first responders, thank you for all the work you do in these terrible, terrible conditions \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue to talk to people and monitor the situation and just see what help we can be \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if we can be of any help at all. Victims airlifted out Dan Repacholi says about six helicopters airlifted victims out of the crash site, taking them to the nearby John Hunter hospital \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the closest trauma centre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and further on to Sydney: They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using all hospitals around the area to make sure that these people get the best care they can. Dan Repacholi says the tragedy will have a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153huge impact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the whole region for some time: [But] the impact on the Hunter Valley is small compared to what the impact is going to be on these families \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and the people in hospital. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how they all are in hospital, so we can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speculate on any of that, but \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 my heart goes out to these families and I really feel for them what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to go through in the near future. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just an absolute tragedy to wake up to\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Federal member for the Hunter Dan Repacholi is appearing now on ABC News Breakfast. Repacholi lives just 15 minutes from the site of the crash. This is absolutely devastating news to wake up to this morning and my heart goes out to the families of the victims and the people in hospital right now. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just an absolute tragedy to wake up to. We drive around the Hunter roads every week, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on these roads. Those roads in that area are good roads. So I really can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see that being an issue. Multiple outlets are reporting that the bus wedding guests had been at the Hunter Valley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Wandin Estate Winery before the crash. The winery, based in Lovedale, is a popular wedding venue and offers on-site accommodation. One wedding guest has told Channel Seven he was in shock after what he described as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairytale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wedding. The guest, speaking outside of John Hunter hospital, said: It was a nice day, a pretty good wedding ... fairytale stuff. And then ... we got the news that there had been a crash, and we all started panicking. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPlease stay away from that area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Executive director of the NSW transport management centre Craig Moran appeared this morning on the Today show. He confirmed the location remained closed, with a police investigation ongoing: We definitely ask people, please stay away from that area. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really tragic event that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s occurred overnight. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of emergency services have responded. The location will be closed for some time to allow those investigations to be undertaken. He said the location of the crash wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153problem location that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re aware of\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: I think it will take police some time. Initial focus has been looking after the people who have been caught up in this tragic event. We are hearing reports that NSW Police are planning to hold a press conference in the next couple of hours to provide an update on the crash. Plibersek sends condolences Minister for the environment and member for Sydney Tanya Plibersek has sent her condolences to the community of the Hunter Valley and those who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve lost loved ones in the crash: A day of celebration ending in tragedy. Just terrible. Crash will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrock the community to its core\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Clayton Barr, the state member for Cessnock, is speaking now on 2GB radio. He says the event is going to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rock the community to its core\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: Greta [where the crash occurred] is a small community \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 20 minutes from larger towns, they [emergency services] would typically be very thin on the ground. Last night it was all hands on deck. He says the event was one of the biggest bus tragedies NSW has faced, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still very early days: I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even know if police have had a chance to contact all the families at the moment because of the nature of the crash \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take a long time to recover for everyone \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 get home safe, wherever you are, get home safe every day. Crash site a large roundabout over a major highway Jay Suvaal said the road where the crash occurred was a large roundabout going over a major highway \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Hunter Expressway. He said there appeared to have been a lot of fog yesterday evening but until crash investigations were complete it would not be known whether this contributed to the tragedy. He is making his way to the crash site this morning: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a close-knit community. We do come together in difficult circumstances. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the community as a whole will be there supporting the local residents around this. And offering any support they can provide to emergency services. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly devastating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Jay Suvaal told ABC News Breakfast the job of the council right now was to support emergency services. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be working with them and through the day looking at what other support is needed to be provided to the community. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly devastating. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a major tourist destination. So I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been many people from across the country that have done similar things to this. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure be sending their love and well wishes along to the people involved in this as well. Jay Suvaal, the mayor of Cessnock, says the 10 people who were killed in the bus rollover were apparently coming from a wedding: He has told ABC News Breakfast: We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re still waiting for further details to come to light as the investigations continue. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the circumstances around the crash at the moment. But it does appear that it was a wedding chartered bus that had been coming from a wedding earlier that day. State MP extends condolences Jenny Aitchison, the state member for Maitland, where the tragedy has occurred, has expressed her condolences to the loved ones of those involved in the tragedy and thanked the first responders: I extend my deepest condolences to the family, friends and loved ones involved in the tragedy in the Hunter overnight. Thank you to all who have responded to this incident in tragic circumstances. Road closures Wine Country Drive remains closed in both directions at Greta, west of Maitland. Motorists are being advised they can divert around the closure via Bridge Street, Drinan Street, Clift Street and the New England Highway. The northbound and southbound off-ramps from the Hunter Expressway to Wine Country Drive are also closed, although through lanes are not affected. Due to the nature of the crash, the NSW Transport Management Centre says there is no forecast for how long the road will be closed. Crime scene established as police investigate An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash has commenced, with a large-scale emergency response involving local police, rescue squad and highway patrol officers, ambulance paramedics, NSW Fire and Rescue and the Rural Fire Service. A crime scene has been established, which will be examined by specialist forensic police and the force\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crash investigation unit. The 58-year-old driver of the bus has been taken to hospital under police guard for mandatory testing and assessment. We have awoken to horrific news overnight that 10 people have been killed when a bus rolled in the NSW Hunter Valley, with 11 more taken to hospital by road and helicopter. Emergency services were called to the crash site about 11.30pm last night at a roundabout on Wine Country Drive near Greta. Initial inquiries indicate 10 people have died, 11 were injured and a further 18 passengers were uninjured, according to a police statement. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have more details on that shortly and updates throughout the day."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/12/simmonds-pulls-out-of-contention-for-englands-rugby-world-cup-squad", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Simmonds pulls out of contention for England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Rugby World Cup squad", "lead": "Mercer and Care are named in England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 28-strong training squad but Simmonds is unavailable", "author": "Robert Kitson", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T08:10:59Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764238", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/996f1a83fcc31c0ca78a4d1116a4e0bf48abe369/0_56_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "England will not be able to select Sam Simmonds for the forthcoming Rugby World Cup after the Montpellier-bound No 8 declared himself unavailable for the tournament.

The bus, carrying 35 people to Singleton after a joyful wedding celebration at nearby Wandin Estate, crashed at a roundabout in the Hunter Valley about 11.30pm on Sunday evening. The 58-year-old Maitland man was taken to hospital under police guard for mandatory testing and assessment and was later transferred to Cessnock police station. He was charged with 10 counts of dangerous driving occasioning death, driving in a dangerous manner and negligent driving occasioning death. He was refused bail and will appear before Cessnock local court on Tuesday. Two people were airlifted to Sydney following the crash, with one remaining in a critical condition. A further 23 were transported to hospitals across the region including John Hunter, Maitland and Calvary Mater in Newcastle. Some have since been released. The NSW police commissioner, Karen Webb, said the most complex part of the job ahead for police was accounting for the victims and passengers on the bus. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can imagine the scene that was confronting police when they attended and that many of those people were treated [and] some people were transported to different locations and then re-diverted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Webb told the media on Monday afternoon. The driver was taken for mandatory testing to determine whether alcohol was a factor in the crash but the results had not been revealed by Monday evening. He received no serious injuries, police said. The crime scene, at a roundabout on Wine Country Drive near Greta, was still being examined by specialist forensic police and officers on Monday evening, while police were also working to determine whether all passengers were wearing seatbelts.

Following criticism from LGBTQ+ supportive groups the Dodgers reversed course and the Sisters returned to the lineup at a stadium where 23 years ago security ejected two female fans for celebrating home runs by kissing. So the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights launched what it termed an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ad blitz\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on local radio in Los Angeles urging fans to boycott the game. The Sisters were also invited to the Los Angeles Angels\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pride Night last week as guests of the Anaheim mayor and protestors reportedly held a prayer circle outside Angels Stadium. Players weighed in. The Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, a Methodist, voiced his disapproval at his club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invitation to the Sisters, although he said his issue was with the Sisters specifically rather than Pride month. He also revealed that Dodger Stadium will host a Christian Faith and Family Day in July. Trevor Williams, a pitcher for the Washington Nationals who is Catholic, said he is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply troubled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the invitation. When the Tampa Bay Rays added rainbow colours to the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uniforms for Pride Night last year at least five players refused to wear the altered kit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to encourage it if we believe in Jesus, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s encouraged us to live a lifestyle that would abstain from that behaviour,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pitcher Jason Adam told the Tampa Bay Times. There was no repeat rainbow rebellion during last Saturday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pride Night at Tropicana Field after MLB introduced a policy this season forbidding teams from changing their uniforms to mark local themed events. Resistance from players has been especially visible in the NHL, where several teams have decided not to wear Pride jerseys, not least because of the presence of Russian players and the anti-gay laws in that country. Once viewed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c however speciously \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as an escape from the wider world, American sports and politics have been explicitly entwined since athletes began protesting civil rights injustices, prodding their organisations to take a stance amid the polarising rise to power of Donald Trump. In the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153war on woke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd waged by leading Republican politicians such as the Florida governor and presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis, some brands seeking to showcase their progressive credentials have faced intense rightwing criticism and calls for boycotts. Sales of Bud Light plummeted after a transgender influencer posted an Instagram video promoting the beer, while Target removed some Pride products from its stores after threats towards employees. The fast-food chain Chick-fil-A was founded by a staunch Christian, is closed on Sundays and has previously donated to organisations with anti-LGBTQ+ stances. Yet even it was accused of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going woke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for strengthening its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Last month Anthony Bass of the Toronto Blue Jays reposted an Instagram video that described Target and Bud Light\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evil\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153demonic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The pitcher apologised but the furore appears to have played a role in the team dropping him on Friday, hours before he was to catch a ceremonial first pitch during the Blue Jays\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Pride Weekend as a form of atonement. Bass is hardly an outlier though. A significant proportion of MLB players are from strict religious backgrounds, while much of its US talent pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and fanbase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is drawn from conservative parts of the country. As the New York Mets\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Mark Canha put it last year: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m probably in the minority [among MLB players] in saying I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an ally to [the LGBTQ+] community \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 You have to hope that this country moves towards a place of more acceptance and more forward thinking.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dale Scott, an MLB umpire from 1986 to 2017, says the recent uproar is reflective of wider trends. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel like the pushback is part of a much bigger thing than just baseball, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening nationwide with this extreme right philosophy that everything is bad if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not straight and white,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scott tells the Guardian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The way I see it, the Maga faction of the right wing is protesting everything.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scott became the first openly gay MLB umpire in 2014 and last year published an autobiography, The Umpire Is Out: Calling the Game and Living My True Self. He threw the ceremonial first pitch at Tropicana Field last Saturday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been people that maybe aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on board with [Pride festivities],\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new is that the voice has been amplified and has given the license for a lot of people to jump on that anti-Pride bandwagon that might have stayed silent in the past \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The pushback is much louder.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Still, out of the 30 MLB teams, only one is not hosting a Pride fixture this season: the Texas Rangers, who have never done so. The Dallas area is home to a large and vibrant LGBTQ+ community \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a raft of influential conservative megachurches. Asked why they are the only Pride Night holdouts, the Rangers provided a statement that did not directly answer the question. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our commitment is to make everyone feel welcome and included in Rangers baseball. That means in our ballpark, at every game, and in all we do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for both our fans and our employees,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it read, adding that the team sponsored the 2022 Gay Softball World Series in Dallas and works to promote inclusivity with a range of community groups. Texas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Republican governor, Greg Abbott, one of many conservative state-level politicians across the nation eager to roll back transgender rights at a time when hate crimes are rising sharply, refused an invitation to throw out the first pitch at the Rangers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 2021 home opener. This was in protest at MLB removing that year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s All-Star Game from Atlanta because Georgia introduced restrictive election laws seen by critics as an attempt to suppress the votes of non-white people. Trump urged his followers to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153boycott baseball\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though, much like his core support, the sport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fanbase skews older, male and white. Rubio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s letter to Manfred cites MLB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal to nostalgics and traditionalists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Baseball has always been tied to our nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s values, at the heart of which is faith in God,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote \u00e2\u20ac\u201c though if baseball is to be extolled as an embodiment of America, its history of racism and exclusion, and its capacity to evolve to reflect and effect cultural change, should also be acknowledged. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I still think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pretty conservative sport but in a lot of ways they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been very proactive,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scott says of MLB leadership. More than 20,000 players have taken to the field in MLB but no active player has come out publicly. In 1982, three years after his last MLB appearance, the late Glenn Burke became the first to do so. Billy Bean, who retired in 1995, came out publicly in 1999, and TJ House came out in 2022, five years after the end of his brief MLB career. Bean, who was named MLB Ambassador for Inclusion in 2014 and is now the league\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior vice-president for diversity, equity and inclusion, did not respond to an interview request. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been surprised quite frankly that baseball hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had someone on the active major league level come out, with other sports having that happen. I could see where someone might be a little leery now if he was thinking about coming out because of the nasty climate that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the country right now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scott says. All in all, he adds: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It kind of proves why you have to have Pride Night.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/12/older-people-hired-as-money-mules-by-gangs-as-cost-of-living-crisis-bites", "primaryCategory": "money", "title": "Older people hired as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmoney mules\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by gangs as cost of living crisis bites", "lead": "More people in their 50s and 60s are being recruited to allow their bank accounts to be used in scams", "author": "Shane Hickey", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T08:00:14Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764243", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/95789f72852931964af833b056f66ed3f5b78890/0_157_4751_2852/500.jpg", "body": "A growing number of people aged in their 50s and 60s are allowing their bank accounts to be used to move money illegally. Fraud experts say that among the increasing number being recruited as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153money mules\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c those who allow their bank details to be used to transfer criminals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cash \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are older account holders, as well as business owners who use company bank accounts. Money mules are often not actually involved in crime, but allow their accounts be used as part of scams where cash is shifted quickly from one bank to another. In many cases these have been teenagers and students attracted by promises of gifts, or cash, in return. But the cost of living crisis has, in part, fuelled the rise in older people taking part in the fraud, says Tristan Prince at Experian, the credit reference agency. There has been, he says, a sharp rise in the last year in frauds where money mules have been used. New figures from the agency, which works to identify this activity, show that just over two out of every five instances of fraud on current accounts are related to money mules. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Crucially, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not solely a problem for the young and vulnerable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Prince. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been a real shift in the profile of people being approached to become money mules. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had instances where customers, who have been with banks for many years, and have had accounts with normal activity, and potentially driven by the cost of living or other challenges, have been approached to become a money mule and have decided to do so. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Equally, we have seen business accounts being used. Some gangs will target businesses in financial difficulty, and pay them off, effectively to have access to their bank accounts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Knowingly transferring money on behalf of criminals is money laundering and can be punished with up to 14 years in prison. Money mules can also suffer from a poor credit rating and struggle to get a bank account. The scale of cybercrime has ballooned in recent years and, with it, the demand for bank accounts to be used. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Criminals need somewhere to deposit and extract, legitimise and launder the proceeds,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Prince. Money mules can be targeted for recruitment by text messages or emails offering healthy returns for minimal work, through romance scams, cryptocurrency investment vehicles and many other methods. Different messages are used to attract different types of mule \u00e2\u20ac\u201c be they people who are short of money or looking for companionship, explains Prince. Older mules are particularly attractive to gangs who run fraud scams, as banks have introduced systems to block criminal activity from young people, says Serpil Hall, head of fraud prevention at D4t4 Solutions, a technology firm that deals with fraud and scams. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Criminals know that financial institutions put strong measures in place to monitor students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and young people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accounts,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They changed tactics and moved on to existing customer accounts which have been with that institution for a number of years. Almost overnight the new target group moved to those in their 30s, 40s or even 50s. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They choose various recruitment mechanisms to launder stolen funds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcget rich-quick schemes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, posting fake adverts on job websites and social media targeting those looking for work or in a difficult financial situation, such as coping with redundancy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Transaction fraud detection systems are great at spotting anomalies, but if you cast the net to business accounts, this makes it more complex \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even for very sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to spot anomalies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cifas, the not-for-profit fraud prevention body, says that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mule herders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd target older people, in part, because larger transactions from their accounts are less likely to arouse suspicions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have also seen fraudsters tricking people into becoming unwitting mules by placing fake job adverts on recruitment websites and social media platforms,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says chief executive Mike Haley. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Criminals request the bank account details of applicants on the premise that they are required to pay their wages, with amounts often \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsent in error\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and requested to be transferred into a different account. Middle-aged people need to be increasingly vigilant, and understand that the consequences of being a money mule can be devastating and life-changing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both for them and their families.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd People in their 50s and 60s, who have allowed their accounts to be used can still be detected through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flags\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that alert the banks, says Prince. This could be a person who had never asked for a new account in 50 years, but suddenly applies for a challenger bank account in the middle of the night, which is then in receipt of thousands of pounds. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is \u00c2\u00a35,000 being received but then \u00c2\u00a34,000 is going straight back out? That difference is your commission payment for handling the money,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Prince. Typically, money held in a mule account is moved to between two and three others before being transferred to an international account, or a cryptocurrency wallet and then brought back into the UK financial system, according to Experian. Often the mule accounts will be newly opened, but the holder will have older accounts that can still be used if the new one is shut down."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/12/soldier-sailor-by-claire-kilroy-review-a-mothers-confession-after-the-fight-of-her-life", "primaryCategory": "books", "title": "Soldier Sailor by Claire Kilroy review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s confession after the fight of her life", "lead": "An unnamed narrator shares the dislocating demands of early motherhood with her son in Kilroy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astonishing new novel", "author": "Stephanie Merritt", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T08:00:14Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764245", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0200dc056a220cdcbe8668782b59adf88487143a/0_242_2331_1398/500.jpg", "body": "In 2015, Claire Kilroy published an essay in the Irish arts anthology Winter Papers, F for Phone, in which she described how the birth of her son, Lawrence, three years earlier had robbed her of the ability to write: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Writing used to be the answer to all my problems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it enabled me to make something out of the bad things in my life, to use them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but now I can no longer write. So I can no longer fix my life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finally, after an 11-year gap since her last book, she has found a way to use those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153angry few years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, transmuting them into the tour-de-force of her fifth novel. Soldier Sailor is an astonishing high-wire act: a narrative at once raw and polished, brutally funny and quietly devastating, every sentence a precision-guided missile to the undefended core of any reader who has endured the dislocation of early motherhood. And it is specifically \u00e2\u20ac\u0153motherhood\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; the battle-scarred Soldier of the title is the unnamed female narrator who discovers, on becoming a mother, that the equality she thought she shared with her husband was only a veneer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was just a woman! How had this not registered before? A woman was of less value in society than a man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She resents him for being able to maintain his life outside the confines of child rearing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Which is not to say that your father was my world, but that he was free to roam in my world, which we should now call his world, or perhaps the world, an adult place from which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been banished. Now I lived in your world. It was small.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The book is an extended confession addressed to the narrator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s son, whom she calls Sailor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an attempt to make sense of the borderline insanity of those early months. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I almost left you once,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says, then corrects herself: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A bad confession is worse than none at all. I did leave you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This opening sequence is a punch to the gut: in the throes of postnatal crisis, she describes leaving her new baby swaddled on a cliff top while she sets out to take her own life, believing it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best for him. Later, returning home after an almost supernatural intervention, the most poignant detail: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There was a letter in the swaddle. A watermark of tears on the envelope. The mother had wanted the baby to some day see those tears and forgive her. I opened the stove and tossed the letter into the fire.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mortality, its proximity to birth and motherhood, is watermarked through the novel, as the ultimate equaliser and the ultimate expression of inequality: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tell me, men: when were you last split open from the inside?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Militaristic images abound: she speaks of the potential for violence that motherhood ignites, the urge to kill (others, yourself) to protect your child. There is a visceral quality to Kilroy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s writing; she captures the epic magnitude of mother love \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the terrible, mind-bending realisation that you will one day be separated by death \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the grinding drudgery of just getting through the days. That she can render new what has been so often documented is testament to the originality of her prose, which she makes appear effortless: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You tore off your bib and cast it to the floor like a man quitting his job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Little kids bolted around in all directions, their skulls narrowly missing one another.

You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be hard put to divine a political or satirical meaning here exactly, although you can find one if you really want.

Outrageously, Shengelaia simply uses a crane (just out of shot) to hoist it into the air, uses more crane and airborne shots to give us the point-of-view of these magnificent men in their flying machine waving down to the tiny people below, and even uses very audacious and perhaps dangerous wire-work to give us a long shot of the plane in flight. I wish he had given us this plane earlier in the film, because you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help laughing every time you see it.

And with London and Paris currently sweltering in a stormy heatwave, the decision by an Italian giant of the industry to hold its most glamorous show of the year in Scandinavia instead of the Mediterranean may signal a shift in the zeitgeist that extends beyond clothes to other lifestyle choices. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think going somewhere cooler in summer will increasingly be a thing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ian Griffiths, the British designer who has steered Max Mara for 36 years, before the show. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you really want to go on holiday to Spain when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as hot as it is in London now?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hygge for the heat meant slouchy drawstring shorts, maxidresses overrun with tiny wildflowers, sleeveless jackets with silk tassels, and slinky dark vest dresses. A black-and-white poncho cover-up nodded to Sarah Lund\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sweater in The Killing, the Rosetta stone of Scandi chic; paper flower crowns to the folklore and myths that swirl in the near-endless light of Swedish midsummer. Stockholm city hall is the venue for the annual Nobel prize banquet in December, and Griffiths said he had come to Scandinavia for its emphasis on design over surface decoration and for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a strong tradition of parity between the sexes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, both of which chime with Max Mara. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Even the Vikings sowed seeds of gender equality. Women did their fair share of pillaging,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Griffiths\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fondness for esoteric references have earned him a reputation as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stephen Fry of the fashion world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which he says is only part-earned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I get quite a lot of it from Google,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he admitted backstage. Max Mara\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s specific muse for this collection was Selma Lagerl\u00c3\u00b6f: gay writer, suffragist and social activist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who in 1909 became the first woman to win the Nobel prize for literature. The fashion students Griffiths teaches at Manchester Metropolitan University \u00e2\u20ac\u0153often have interesting intellectual ideas that translate into very complicated clothes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he noted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nobody wants to wear complicated clothes. Scandinavian design is happy, simple, but sophisticated. The trick is how you express complex ideas in clothes that people want to wear.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Griffiths, an ex-Manchester clubber who as a young new romantic once went to the Ha\u00c3\u00a7ienda every night for six months, consistently teases out the quietly radical side of a brand that made its name by dressing women for work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a bold move, in 1950s Italy; which was one of the first designer names to have a plus-size label (Marina Rinaldi was launched in 1980); and has been a leader in diversity, the first label to have a model in a hijab on the catwalk, in 2017. Wear-forever clothes are buzzy in fashion now, as the industry struggles to adapt to a sustainability mindset, but at Max Mara they have been there all along. Camel coats have featured in every winter collection for more than 40 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and for when the heatwave breaks, there were two in this show."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/12/michael-gove-boris-johnson-conservatives-past", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLife moves on\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Gove attempts to consign Boris Johnson to Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 past", "lead": "Minister stresses Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsignificant contributions\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as Tories seek to move on from ex-PM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation", "author": "Peter Walker Deputy political editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T07:43:35Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764251", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d5b7756200e239dd2d7f9af0786a4962615946f3/13_122_3772_2264/500.jpg", "body": "Michael Gove has said that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153life moves on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation as an MP, as ministers tried once again to shift attention from an embittered former leader showing little sign of wanting to leave parliament quietly. Gove, the UK communities and housing secretary, used a morning broadcast round to stress what he said were the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant contributions that Boris made\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while firmly presenting him as a figure now in the Conservatives\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 past. Gove was asked if he agreed that Johnson, who announced on Friday evening he was stepping down as an MP to pre-empt a damning verdict from the Commons privileges committee into whether he misled parliament over Covid-era parties, should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shut up and go away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the verdict of one Tory MP. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve given Boris advice in the past,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gove told Sky News. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always necessarily followed my advice, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll refrain from offering any advice to him now except to say today, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made a decision to stand down. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an individual decision for him, but the work of government goes on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a separate interview, on BBC One\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Breakfast, Gove offered a similar view when asked if this was the last UK politics had seen of the former prime minister. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to step down means that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no longer a member of parliament, and life moves on,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gove said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As for Boris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future, that will be a matter for him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnson has made plain his intention to get his point of view across even outside parliament, complaining to the Times on Monday about what he said was Cabinet Office obstruction over another investigation, the official inquiry into the Covid pandemic. The government is seeking to avoid passing unedited WhatsApp messages and diaries by Johnson to the inquiry, which Johnson has offered to pass on himself. He told the paper the Cabinet Office was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153foot-dragging\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and wasting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153public time and money\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Cabinet Office has blocked me from directly sharing unredacted material with the inquiry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite my repeated attempts to do so. The privileges committee, which has a Tory majority and Labour chair, was due to meet on Monday morning to finalise its report into whether Johnson deliberately misled parliament when he said there had been no lockdown-breaching gatherings. It is expected to recommend a suspension for Johnson of 10 days or greater, which would have been enough to trigger a possible recall petition by his Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency, which Johnson could well have lost. The full report could be made public as soon as Wednesday, with its findings and any recommended punishment then voted on by MPs. Asked if he might vote to endorse the conclusions, Gove told Sky: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to read the report. Like every member of parliament, all of us will have the opportunity to vote according to our judgment on this matter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He did, however, dispute the complaints of Johnson and his supporters that the committee was biased against the former prime minister. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boris will have his own recollection,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gove said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The critical thing is, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a properly constituted committee of the House of Commons with distinguished and experienced MPs on it. Neither of us have yet read the report, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to wait and see and pass judgment on it later. But no, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t describe the committee as a kangaroo court, not at all.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if Johnson could make a comeback, Gove replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Boris is someone who, in my observation, likes to keep his options open. It would be a foolish person who could claim they have predicted every twist and turn in Boris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political career with absolute accuracy. So I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in his mind.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gove worked closely with Johnson in government, but had his differences with the former PM \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most notably when he unexpectedly decided to stand against him for the Conservative leadership when David Cameron stood down in 2016, prompting Johnson to abandon his own bid. Asked if he had, politically speaking, stabbed Johnson in the back, Gove said he had merely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153offered a judgment at various critical points\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/12/afternoon-update-hunter-valley-reeling-after-bus-crash-afl-player-bailed-on-burglary-charges-and-what-grip-strength-says-about-health", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Afternoon Update: Hunter Valley reeling after bus crash; AFL player bailed on burglary charges; and what grip strength says about health", "lead": "Bus driver in custody after crash near town of Greta which left 10 dead and more than 20 injured", "author": "Mostafa Rachwani", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T07:34:43Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764252", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0f23227fd664b3a35778af897c098d6531cf9b8d/0_182_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Good afternoon.

One answer is found in the irresistible quality of the 2022\u00e2\u20ac\u201823 Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup victors. The team that Guardiola built is so dominant and, seemingly, so unstoppable that it is a natural fount of the energy and drive required to rejuvenate the Catalan for the foreseeable future. In the early hours of Sunday morning, after receiving rippling applause in the Ataturk Stadium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s media room following the 1-0 defeat of Internazionale, Guardiola was an intriguing blend of exhaustion and defiance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask me about next season,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the 52-year-old said before, later, insisting that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153knowing me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there will be no falling away when the defence of their titles begins in August. By then the Community Shield may have been added, the European Super Cup final versus Sevilla in Athens will be four days away, and Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye will be on the Club World Cup in December as this trophy-addict tilts at a clean sweep of honours. Yet when Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenure might reach its endgame is a poser he has tossed about more than once during his seven-year reign. At the start of the season just ended, 12 months remained on his contract, and there was surprise from confidantes when he signed a fresh two-year deal during the World Cup. When he took over back in the summer of 2016 there had been the sense of a perfectionist coach who would remain in charge for a finite time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then a three-year contract. This, remember, was the man who had just completed a three-year span in charge of Bayern Munich, preceded by a 12-month sabbatical, and whose four seasons at Barcelona (2008-12) ended in resignation with Guardiola citing how a stint at that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kind of club\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd felt an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eternity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Under him, City are now that kind of club, too. One in the elite rank that is favourite for every competition they enter, which brings a particular pressure. From a certain angle, the triumph on Saturday can be viewed as the natural finishing line to all Guardiola has worked towards since striding on to the Etihad campus; and, too, what he was hired to do. For years there were denials that the chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, his sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, and chief executive, Ferran Soriano, had ever ordered Guardiola to bring the European Cup to east Manchester. In recent weeks the stance altered: he began speaking of City being a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big club\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd only once they claimed the continent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier trophy. In part that may have been the ever-shrewd coach calculating that his players needed to hear this as motivation because, after losing the 2021 Champions League final against Chelsea in Porto, he would forget playing down the tournament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s import, and instead talk up the absolute need to be the Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s No 1 club. It worked: City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first European Cup and Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third as a manager ensured the treble as the team from the town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s blue zone joined the one from the red \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Sir Alex Ferguson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1999 Manchester United vintage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as immortals, and sealed his status as an all-time great (if not already secured). What else, then, is there to achieve at City? Again, the word is eyebrows will be raised if Guardiola stays on beyond the next two seasons, as he will then have managed the side for nine years. Departing in summer 2025 would also make impossible any tilt at a challenge that might keep Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s uber-competitive juices flowing: overtaking Ferguson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s remarkable record at United of 13 Premier Leagues, five FA Cups, four League Cups, two European Cups, one European Cup-Winners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Cup, one European Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one Fifa Club World Cup. Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s City honours roll stands at five Premier Leagues, one European Cup, two FA Cups and four League Cups. Win the European Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup and Ferguson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tally in these is equalled, which Guardiola has already done in the League Cup. He now has half as many European Cups with City as Ferguson, is three behind in FA Cups, and eight in the Premier League. Yet by one metric Guardiola is ahead of what Ferguson achieved in more than 26 years at United: that of trophies per\u00e2\u20ac\u2018season. Disregarding Charity/Community shields, Ferguson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s count ended on 28, making his ratio 1.05 a season, while Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12 have come at 1.74, so if he continues the Scot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s haul would be eclipsed in around a decade. Might this tempt Guardiola? Ten years is an age in elite management yet Guardiola will be only 62 in 2033, 12 months younger than Carlo Ancelotti is now, and as the XI that sealed Champions League glory hardly teems with gnarled veterans he may have to construct only one more great team to outstrip Ferguson. Of those who lined at up in Istanbul, Ilkay G\u00c3\u00bcndogan may be 32 and Kevin De Bruyne 31, but Ederson is 29, Ruben Dias and John Stones 26 and 29, Nathan Ak\u00c3\u00a9 and Bernardo Silva 28, Rodri 26, Jack Grealish and Manuel Akanji 27, and Erling Haaland 22. Guardiola has proved his regenerative powers by evolving the rampant Sergio Ag\u00c3\u00bcero-David Silva 100-point/domestic treble vintage into domestic and European kings so replacing G\u00c3\u00bcndogan, De Bruyne, and whoever else may depart in the coming years appears no problem. And there is another reason why he may be drawn, yet again, to extend his tenure. At 52 and in his prime, where else would he go? Coaching in Italy remains a target but could he really enjoy what he does now at a Serie A side, or elsewhere? Because as much as the all\u00e2\u20ac\u2018conquering City is the team that Pep built, in this golden second phase of Sheikh Mansour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ownership, in which Soriano and Begiristain were headhunted to give him the best possible chance of success, this is the club configured for the man from Santpedor."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/12/celtic-have-problems-of-their-own-making-as-they-seek-postecoglous-successor", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Celtic have problems of their own making as they seek Postecoglou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor | Ewan Murray", "lead": "A return for Brendan Rodgers has been rumoured but a lower-profile manager like Enzo Maresca may make more sense", "author": "Ewan Murray", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T07:00:14Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764259", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cd2ce6f2da235df765f74ade014f6aacdd13408d/0_110_3500_2101/500.jpg", "body": "Celtic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supporters must know not to fall for managers. Ange Postecoglou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exit for Tottenham maintained a theme which dictates those fans will surely be careful not to be seduced by the Australian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor. These marriages are only ever of convenience. Neil Lennon, Postecoglou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s immediate predecessor, is an iconic Celtic figure who was subjected to vile abuse before time was called on his second tenure. What Lennon should have had stored in the bank of goodwill counted for nothing. Brendan Rodgers was revered in the east end of Glasgow before he, like Postecoglou, was coaxed by the bright lights of the Premier League. That Rodgers leapt shortly before delivery of an eighth consecutive title infuriated a noisy element of the Celtic support, as if such landmarks resonate anywhere beyond Scotland and Leicester were supposed to time the sacking of Claude Puel accordingly. Speculation linking Rodgers with a return to Celtic refuses to fully dissipate. The 50-year-old has told friends, including on a recent visit to Glasgow, that he intends to take a year away from the dugout after the wounding manner in which things imploded for him at Leicester. Managers routinely have such ideas; they are often altered by what is perceived as the right offer. Rodgers likes money but he does not need it. He can afford to be relatively picky. The Northern Irishman has made no secret of a desire to work abroad. Rodgers has little or nothing to gain by taking on a second Celtic stint. He has been there, seen it and done it in a Scottish domestic context. Eventually and unsurprisingly Rodgers realised his broader reputation was hardly being enhanced by harrowing European nights. Nothing is likely to change there. Celtic will play in the Champions League once more next season and could of course receive a lucky draw. Yet Postecoglou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lauded XI was comfortably bottom of Group F in this campaign. Rangers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 zero point embarrassment in the same domain meant Celtic could even derive one\u00e2\u20ac\u2018upmanship from that. Dermot Desmond, Celtic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s principal shareholder, can be a persuasive man. Desmond is acutely aware he needs to deliver a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153name\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to placate supporters who are hurt by Postecoglou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively swift departure. If there is lingering discontent about Rodgers, Desmond is unlikely to care. That Celtic are not willing to make it straightforward for their assistant manager, John Kennedy, to follow Postecoglou to north London at least implies they are not particularly amused by recent events. This would also suggest Celtic believed for most of the season just completed that Postecoglou would remain in post for one more tilt at the Champions League. Succession planning has never been a Celtic forte. Instead, there is an obsession with prevailing in Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two-horse domestic scene. Rodgers loved Glasgow but, naturally, lost his appetite for the football environment. If the Rodgers link does indeed amount to nothing, Kjetil Knutsen and Enzo Maresca are known to have admirers inside Celtic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boardroom. Knutsen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sterling work with Bod\u00c3\u00b8/Glimt has earned him admirers and job links galore but, curiously, no move. Now 54, Knutsen will know he has to seize a bigger opportunity some time soon. He appears to suffer from the lack of broader respect afforded to Norwegian coaches. Postecoglou was once in a similar scenario, with Celtic providing the ideal platform for him to showcase his talents. There are parallels, too, in that Knutsen would want to implement a clear style of play. Maresca impressed Desmond and others when interviewed by Celtic before. Any coach under Pep Guardiola clearly knows what they are doing and the example of Mikel Arteta will be cited by those who believe Maresca is bound for glory of his own. His short, ill-fated time in charge of Parma in 2021 raises red flags. Celtic have fished in the City Football Group pond before, including with Postecoglou, but this appointment would carry huge risk. Rik De Mil, the assistant manager at Club Brugge, AZ Alkmaar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pascal Jansen, Daniel Farke and Graham Potter have also been linked with Celtic. De Mil and Jansen look to have bright futures. Potter could reasonably believe his role in the omnishambles at Chelsea will be overlooked by Premier League clubs given his success at both Swansea and Brighton. Moving to Scotland, so soon after being regarded as the hottest managerial property in England, would be viewed as taking two steps back. Farke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career has stalled. Celtic, extraordinarily for a club of such size, have no director of football. Their model has been so intrinsically linked to Postecoglou for two years that they are now in a tricky position. It is not a given that their new manager will have to oversee a rebuild but this individual has to earn the trust of five Japanese players \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two of them, Kyogo Furuhashi and Reo Hatate, are massively influential \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and vice versa. Postecoglou shaped the squad precisely as he wanted, with positive results meaning he was implicitly trusted by directors. Scratching below the surface, Celtic in so many ways resemble an analogue football club in a digital age. Perhaps Celtic have no reason to rue Postecoglou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s switch. Clubs the world over would be perfectly content with two profitable years from a manager who is poached by someone further up the food chain. Had Postecoglou flopped, nobody would have been remotely interested in him anyway. Celtic have to determine whether they are happy with potential replication of that storyline or want longer\u00e2\u20ac\u2018term stability. What they actually need is someone who will broaden their horizons. They require a visible pathway for youth players, a level of performance that can at least make reasonable inroads in Europe and a reputation which leaves other huge entities in small leagues across the continent dripping with jealousy. The manager who ticks those boxes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and who will be given leeway to see a world beyond Ross County \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is their man."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/12/us-air-travel-workers-passengers", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "US workers and passengers expect further misery as air travel rebounds", "lead": "Employees complain about pay and conditions, travelers say prices are too high and service is poor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c why is airline travel so bad?", "author": "Michael Sainato", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T07:00:14Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764260", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/94e8f9a9c9df5bea167c0c17a2898e6572782b9f/0_0_1500_900/500.jpg", "body": "The world is traveling again. Summer air travel is expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels in 2023, according to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and airline revenues are back to near record levels. But for airline workers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who suffered the brunt of pandemic shutdowns and then the spike in air rage that followed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c unresolved labor issues remain and many are warning that for passengers those issues, which have led to a surge in operational problems, remain and are likely to cause more concerns this holiday season. Dirty planes are just one of the issues travelers are likely to face, according to Rosa Sanchez, an airplane cabin cleaner for airline contractor Swissport, which provides service for several airlines at Logan airport in Boston. Understaffing and a lack of adequate protective equipment has driven high turnover rates and undermined the effectiveness of her and her co-workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 ability to properly clean planes, she said. She said they are also constantly rushed and not given enough time to clean the planes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough supplies to clean, so we just use what we have or just use water. Sometimes we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a mop, so we use the blankets left on airplanes by passengers to clean the floors,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sanchez. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes in the bathroom there will be blood on the floor, toilet, walls, and there is feces and urine on top of the toilet. When I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough gloves, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to wrap a blanket around my hand to clean the bathroom.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She recounted an incident in 2022, when she was poked by a hypodermic needle left on a plane, continued working, and had to pay for medical care out of her own pocket afterwards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was rushing to clean because we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough people. I reached in and pulled my hand out of a seat pocket and the needle was sticking out of my finger,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t value us, even though we value the work that we do for them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sanchez and several workers at Swissport, the largest airport services provider in the US, have filed complaints against the company with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha). Swissport has refuted the claims, saying the company is in full compliance with labor regulations and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the health and safety of all our employees is the highest priority for Swissport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The pandemic fundamentally changed the airline industry, said Gary Peterson, executive director of the office of the international president of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), and a licensed aircraft maintenance technician. While the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economics may have recovered, workers and passengers are still suffering. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The industry shifted, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not what it once was. The airline executives, they look at numbers to see how to get in more seats, reducing the distance between seats \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all of these things contribute to why there are problems with passengers in the air,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Peterson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no comfort in flying any more unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a first-class or business-class seat. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a coach-class seat, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brutal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Staffing issues for pilots and licensed mechanics have been exacerbated by lags in training due to Covid, and the use of pandemic bailout funds by airlines to buy out or force the early retirement of senior employees under the assumption there would be a pipeline of replacement workers at lower costs when travel demand rebounded, said Peterson. But while Covid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impact has exacerbated the situation, the worsening experience of many workers and passengers has a long history. Airlines have long been known and criticized for tacking on fees to ticket prices for basics such as checking in luggage or a few extra inches of legroom. In 2014, Columbia University professor Tim Wu characterized this trend among airlines as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153calculated misery\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, noting airlines have charged fees for basic services that used to be included with ticket prices and airplane seats have gotten smaller over the years, worsening the experience of air travel for passengers and workers. Add into that mix the increased concentration and market power of a handful of airlines that now dominate the industry in the wake of deregulation, consolidation that occurred after 9/11, and outsourcing that has further deteriorated air travel service. The pandemic increased this misery. Consumer complaints against airlines surged more than 300% compared with pre-pandemic levels in April 2022 amid operational issues, flight cancellations and delays roiling the airline industry. For workers, complaints have revolved around degrading conditions and inadequate staffing and resources to do their jobs. Peterson noted the airline industry has used staff shortages as an excuse to pursue policies such as pushing to reduce two-person pilot crews to one pilot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which unions have aggressively opposed over safety concerns \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the outsourcing of maintenance to foreign countries with fewer safety standards and regulations. For flight attendants, the pandemic created staffing and operational issues for the workers that remained in the industry, conditions that have incited recent union organizing and legislative efforts. Rasaq Adeyemi, a flight attendant at Delta and member of a union organizing committee with the Association of Flight Attendants, claimed the energy around the union campaign has surged in response to conditions and treatment of workers coming out of the pandemic. Delta is the last of the major airlines where flight attendants are currently not unionized. Delta has claimed its direct relationship with employees is superior to unions. Workers say they need a union for protection against the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unilateral decisions, policies and cuts that have affected workers and their working conditions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Delta used to be a people-first company, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the case any more. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just numbers to them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Adeyemi. He criticized a recent policy issued by Delta under which the names of flight attendants would be provided to passengers ahead of a flight. The customer recognition tool policy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rollout was quickly paused after workers called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unnecessary and frankly creepy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the company apologized for the stress it had caused. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are a lot of harassment concerns around the policy, especially for female flight attendants,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Adeyemi. Flight attendants reported a surge in violence and abuse through the Covid pandemic that they say has continued. A union-backed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Assault won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd campaign is pushing for federal legislation to enact and enforce a no-fly list for unruly passengers. A 2021 survey found 84% of flight attendants had dealt with unruly passengers on board and 17% of respondents said they experienced a physical incident. Cases of disruptive passengers investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration surged in 2020, 2021 and 2022. The number of reported incidents of assault against flight attendants and other airline workers increased from about 1,000 in 2020 to about 6,000 incidents in 2021. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has come down a little bit since the mask mandate has gone away but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still much, much higher than it was before,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Thom McDaniel, a flight attendant at Southwest for 31 years and international vice-president with the TWU. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes we think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a result of the frustrations that people have from being locked up during Covid or frustrations that they have from coming to the airport and finding out that they have extended delays, or whether their flights are canceled because some of the mismanagement that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing in the industry right now, and the things that haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been addressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A series of events led Southwest to suffer an operational meltdown in December, resulting in the cancellation of over 16,700 flights and stranding 2 million passengers. McDaniel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s union is currently in federal mediation over new union contract negotiations for flight attendants at Southwest, which have been ongoing for over four years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Flight attendants really expect to see a contract that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to not only respect what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been through, but also compensate them for all the time when we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen inflation increased at record rates,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd added McDaniel. He also cited ongoing pushes for legislation to improve working conditions, which range from providing breastfeeding accommodations for flight crews, federal regulations to protect passengers and flight crew members from toxic fumes on airplanes, and reining in the trend of airlines outsourcing aviation maintenance abroad to cut costs. Workers for airlines and airline contractors, where low-paid workers have been increasingly outsourced in recent decades from being directly employed by airlines, have complained of being overworked and underpaid as staff shortages are still prevalent in many parts of the industry. Carlos Hernandez, a cargo agent for Swissport, which contracts for United at Dulles airport in Washington, has said understaffing and the pressure to load cargo on to planes on time have resulted in safety issues. He recently hurt his leg on the job when his supervisor, who was operating a forklift, knocked cargo container panels against him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re rushing us, and you feel terrible, because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll yell at you a lot of times. Sometimes they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even let you go to the bathroom,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Hernandez. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still in terrible pain. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk properly any more. When I step on my foot, I still feel pain in my leg, and I drag it so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t walk normally any more. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only missed one day of work from the injury. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss any more days because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m scared. If I miss a day, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give you a point. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll give you points and these points accumulate and if you get too many points that they can fire you and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already been giving a warning that if I get any more points I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to get suspended.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/12/blatant-sexism-great-painter-francoise-gilot", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBlatant sexism\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: why is a great painter who lived to 101 still defined by a man she left in the 1950s?", "lead": "Fran\u00c3\u00a7oise Gilot had a career that spanned eight decades and her work now fetches over $1m.

Having lived to the age of 101, she had a career that spanned a staggering eight decades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c leaving behind 1,600 paintings and 3,600 works on paper. She was also the acclaimed author of internationally bestselling books, one recently reissued by New York Review Books Classics. An artist from the get-go, Gilot declared at the age of 21 that she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153felt painting was my whole life\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and her output ranges from portraits to landscapes, still lifes to collage. Often luminously coloured, her work uses angular shapes that intersect to make up a beach scene, a cityscape, a speeding comet or a mother and child. But she also turned to monochrome: her 1994 Aspects of Femininity challenged the multitudinous ways women are perceived, while her 1946 work Adam Forcing Eve to Eat an Apple had hard-edged lines in its re-examination of the Biblical tale, focusing on temptation, punishment and the blaming of women. Her work now features in the collections of the Met and MoMA in New York, as well as the Centre Pompidou in Paris. In 2021, her 1965 work Paloma \u00c3\u00a0 la Guitare fetched $1.3m at Sotheby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Gilot, the daughter of a ceramicist mother and lawyer father, received a bachelor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s degree in philosophy at the Sorbonne, and another in English literature from Cambridge University. Although initially interested in law, she switched to art full time due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153security reasons\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, after the Germans invaded Paris. Sadly, her early work disappeared after a cart carrying all her family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possessions crashed during the war. Her first exhibition took place in 1943, when she was just 22. Her first book, detailing the life of her artist-lover, was published in 1964, despite the former partner trying to block it on multiple occasions. Gilot was sharp and formidable. When Emma Brockes interviewed her for the Guardian in 2016, she called her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fierce and uncompromising\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In 2010, Gilot was named a member of the L\u00c3\u00a9gion d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Honneur. But when it came to the headlines announcing her death, the media had other concerns. Instead of honouring and remembering her as the accomplished woman she was, The New York Times wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fran\u00c3\u00a7oise Gilot, Artist in the Shadow of Picasso, Is Dead at 101.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Guardian followed with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153painter and muse to Picasso\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; The Washington Post defined her as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153celebrated artist, writer and muse to Picasso\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd; ARTNews wrote that she was an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Artist Who Fearlessly Chronicled Her Relationship with Picasso\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. My question is: does his name really have to be mentioned? Aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t her career, her achievements, her name, enough to stand on their own? When will the media stop referring to women in relation to a partner they split from over seven decades ago, and perpetuating this blatant sexism? The New York Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subheading originally read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153An accomplished painter (and memoirist) in her own right, she did what no other mistress of his had ever done: She walked out.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The subheading has since been corrected from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mistress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lover\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, considering their relationship lasted almost a decade, and the words \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in her own right\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have been removed. But I want to touch on those four words. This unnecessary parenthesis appears far too commonly, especially with women. It is used to highlight something that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153other\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to what the establishment considers the default: the patriarchy. This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t about removing or cancelling certain stories and details. At times, they are important. But we must be respectful to someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life and how they lived it, what they achieved. If we need to root people to something else, in order to guide readers, could this not be social and political context? How do you think Gilot would have felt at her life being reduced to a headline that referred to a relationship she had in her 20s? In that 2016 interview, Brockes wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She has always pointed out that it does her a great disservice as an artist to identify her as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPicasso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dca friend of Matisse\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because she was so much more than that. Similarly, in 1997, the New York Times\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story about the death of Dora Maar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a pioneering artist working in photography, painting, and photomontage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c merely addressed her as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dora Maar, a Muse of Picasso, Is Dead at 89\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while perpetuating the problematic concept of the muse. Rearranging sentences or using alternative phrases to honour someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life in a respectful manner isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hard, and the media should not default to rooting women as the muses of, the wives of, or in the shadow of.

The test It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to lose the joy of self-expression in makeup, especially as you get older. It stops becoming playful and can start to focus on covering, concealing and fixing. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why this catwalk trend, a multicoloured lip look, as seen on the Dsquared2 spring/summer 2023 catwalk, could be perfect inspiration for exploring and expressing ourselves. Since the pandemic, things have been, well, hard, and my usually bold makeup has definitely become far more tame. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping this trend may lift me out of my makeup rut. Simply take two lipstick shades \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they could be two different reds, or red and pink, or orange and green, whatever you like. Then apply one to the top lip and the other to the bottom. I used red and hot pink, which worked well, and started to blend into a raspberry shade after a while. It was subtle-ish, but definitely a source of low-key intrigue to friends who noticed. I did it again, but with blue and green lipsticks. Very aquatic, much less subtle, and a little out of my comfort zone. But also pretty fun. The verdict It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to try at home, with no extra cost involved, so go for it I say.

If you self-identify as a dog person, you have stereotypically cat characteristics: self-sufficient, transactional, fickle, aloof. People who prefer cats, meanwhile, are warm, friendly and open with their love. My thinking is that we gravitate to those qualities that we feel we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possess. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I envy their insouciant air,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a friend said recently, unprompted, of his love of cats. He just so happens to be the neediest man I know, with a labrador-like ability to see The One in every woman he meets. Of course, if my pet theory is revealing about anyone, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s me. Dogs have been my first, longest and most straightforwardly enjoyable love. My first word was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153woo-wah\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, meaning dog, as I made clear with enthusiastic gestures. About 30 years later, I still delight in pointing out every dog I see \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much to the frustration of some. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yes, yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dog!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a boyfriend once burst out, a few months before breaking up with me. It was never going to work out: he was a cat person (not that kind!). Cats have only been of interest to me when there were no dogs around. Sometimes they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re cute. Mostly, though, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just cats: aloof and capricious, with fast-flying claws, acting all scandalised when you stop to say hello in the street. What I have always loved about dogs is their free-flowing affection, their openness to new friends, their sincere appreciation of simple pleasures. Of course, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rosy view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some dogs (beagles mostly) are just bastards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I see in them something to aspire to, not to own. When my parents finally conceded defeat to my decade-plus campaign, I was 14 years old. In some ways, Ruby the Hungarian vizsla proved to be a life coach as much as she was a companion; an ever-present reminder to go for walks, chat to strangers, assume the best in people, enjoy my life. But since Ruby (who sadly died young), I have not been in a position to get a dog of my own. Fifteen years after moving out from my parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 house, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be getting closer. I rent, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m single, I travel for work and to visit family overseas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and, though I work from home now, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s to say about the next decade? Over time, a dog emerged as not just a symbol of stability \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pushed out of reach along with home ownership \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but a prize to be earned, one day, when I was sufficiently \u00e2\u20ac\u0153settled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. That is, until early this year, when, with a sudden, piercing clarity, I realised two things: first, that it would be at least 10 years before I would be able to get a dog. And then: I could get a cat. Cats\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 only advantage over dogs, as I had always seen it, was that they were lower maintenance. I had at least put down enough roots that I had friends who would be happy to drop by and put some food down when I went away. And any pet was better than none. Six weeks later, after a six-hour journey by car and train, I welcomed a very angry Vlada, a four-year-old rescue, into my flat. As a Cornish rex, Vlada is not quite hairless but has a very short, downy coat. My thinking was, if you are going to get a cat, why not get one that is very funny to look at? Plus, Cornish rexes were said to behave more like dogs. Nearly three months in, I have been quietly astonished by the impact this little cat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more a big rat, bless her \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has had on my life. A lot of it is the companionship. Vlada follows me between rooms. She head-butts me to get up when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve slept in, or shoves me off the laptop when I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m working late. When I have friends over, she goes from lap to lap, evenly apportioning her audience no matter how rowdy we get. Every night she sleeps next to me like a very bony Beanie Baby. As a dog person, I could never have dreamed that a cat would have so much personality. But the biggest revelation has been the stability Vlada has brought me. Last year I was constantly travelling, not quite switched off on holiday but not quite focused on work. Now I go away less, but plan it better and enjoy it more. I have also learned something about love. By dreaming of a dog, denying myself until some distant date, I had been investing in a future, unattainable vision of happiness over the one that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s possible now. I was perturbed to realise that I also had this tendency in relationships. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not that I have quit being a dog person, just as I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up on ever having a partner (though, compared to Vlada, they do both now seem shockingly slobbery). But, as someone who has been cautious about taking a leap in love, or sought it from the wrong places, caring for Vlada reminds me that I am capable of it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that it can come in very funny-looking packages. Sure, a cat might not love you like a dog does, and neither is a replacement for people. But the sneering stereotypes of lonely \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cat ladies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd have it the wrong way around: better the love that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s present, and steady, and given, than the love that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambivalent, or imagined, or withheld.

My love for them sits alongside memories of not being heard in time when I called for the toilet from my cot, and of burying a friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silver spoon in the sand and then being unable to find it. So my attachment to the 2 Tone pioneers is in a file with the early feeling that, despite my best intentions, I had no control over outcomes. After fronting the Specials, Terry Hall went on to lead Fun Boy Three and the Colourfield; he co-wrote Our Lips Are Sealed with Jane Wiedlin, which became a huge hit for both her group, the Go-Gos, and Fun Boy Three. He also joined forces with Ian Broudie to write songs for the Lightning Seeds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 album, Sense. Home, the first album credited to Hall alone, was released in 1994 to critical success and commercial failure. I was a teenager working at a different national newspaper, where I pushed hard to profile him. For the music, and its audible influence on everyone from Blur to No Doubt. But also the groundbreaking work his bands had had in the anti-racism movement at the height of the National Front, and the childhood abuse he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d written a devastatingly matter-of-fact song about [Well Fancy That! with Fun Boy Three]. Getting the best of any interviewee takes prep, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stranger when the person you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interviewing is a first memory. I read Hall loved Sophia Loren and so I replicated her eye make up. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot for an interview in a pub in Coventry. If it had any effect, he was unreadable, his expression famously hangdog. But he was generous with his time, his thoughts, and then he drove me back to the station. When I opened the paper on the Sunday, my article had been cut, with no forewarning, from 1,000 words to 200 and placed as an inset, inside a longer profile of Suggs from Madness. To show lack of care and respect to a 16-year-old girl in the early 90s was tantamount to breathing. But to Terry Hall? I posted an apology card that his PR said was appreciated, as Hall had been genuinely hurt. And on Monday morning, I quit my contract at the paper. I remember so well, my editor replying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only just starting out. Do not burn this bridge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve changed a lot between my teens and middle age, but then and now the visual of a burning bridge is beautiful to me. I love how it looks as the daylight changes, the reflection of the flames on the water. If you are vulnerable, gentle or damaged, you must learn to swim, or evolve until you grow wings and fly. Or, you never actually grow wings because you are a human but you dream about it, and then draw pictures of the dreams, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your art. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m reaching for. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what Terry Hall achieved, or he wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have sung in 1979 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You only wanted to die in order to show off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and 1994 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Feels like I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m living in a town closed down for winter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is a conversation about the same feeling, just at different ages. His lyrics have a particular rhythm: like ordinary people talking, but not speaking as they do in life. The playwright Martin McDonagh does that too. When Hall died last December, all across Twitter and Instagram were the most heartfelt, lavish tributes. And I remember that insulting little inset and the only thing that makes me feel better is that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Insulting Little Inset\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd could be an album title. I text my mum, telling her how gutted I felt. As I am putting my daughter to bed, my mum replies: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He had spinach-coloured eyes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I look at it and laugh out loud. A touching tribute. But this is high, high compliment from a woman who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say such admiring things as, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She has a skull shaped like a tortoiseshell cat!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When I have to give a remembrance for my mum, I will say how much I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll miss her remembrances. The last man I loved was a highly intelligent man from the Midlands whose childhood trauma had left him with an unreadable face. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how you take them with you, your first childhood idol, you carry them into middle-age love. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t explain to this boyfriend (who was younger than me) why Terry Hall\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premature passing at 63 made me cry so much because, to him at his age, Hall wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that important. Just like the article I wrote, that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually what I wrote, but did have my name beside it, that made Hall feel unimportant. Everything that newspaper did wrong in diminishing him was erased by another young woman, 23 years later. The photo was endlessly shared of Saffiyah Khan, a Birmingham Asian girl wearing a Specials T-shirt, looking amused and calm in the shouting face of an EDF racist. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad he lived to see that. He was touched enough to call Khan and ask her to collaborate in a reworking of Prince Buster\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s problematic 1963 song Ten Commandments Of Man \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the Specials\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 first album of new material with Terry Hall in nearly 40 years [Encore].

Soldiers were shown in video footage raising he Ukrainian flag over the village of Blahodatne, south of the town of Velyka Novosilka, one of the main axes of the counteroffensive so far. Troops from another brigade filmed themselves with their unit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banner in Neskuchne. Later on Sunday, the deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said a third village, Makarivka, had been taken. It was believed to have been retaken on Sunday morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the areas where our troops are on the defensive, no position was lost,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maliar said on the Telegram messaging app. They are the first settlements that the armed forces have officially confirmed as liberated since the start of the counteroffensive a week earlier. Another settlement further south along the same road, Urozhaine, was being fiercely contested, according to Russian military bloggers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By the way, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move our main forces yet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Ukrainian officer texted from the southern front. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So there are grounds to believe in the best.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In total, in one week of assault operations around Velyka Novosilka, Ukrainians managed to liberate around 95 sq km of the ground,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Ukrainian military reporter blogging under the title of Reporting from Ukraine wrote. The advance south from Velyka Novosilka represents the most significant gains of the counteroffensive to date, but Ukrainian forces still have some way to go before they reach Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main fortified defensive line. On Sunday, railway lines supplying Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia region and Crimea were reportedly blown up in two sabotage attacks, one on a railway bridge at Yakimivka in Zaporizhzhia and another in Kirovskoye in Crimea, where a freight locomotive was said to have been damaged. Along with signs that the counteroffensive was beginning to gain momentum, at least in one area, there was more evidence on Sunday of the rifts in Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military leadership. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner group mercenary organisation, rejected a move by the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, to put Wagner fighters under ministry control by ordering all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153volunteer detachments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to sign contracts with the ministry by the end of the month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prigozhin said. Across the whole front, progress had been slow and gruelling for the Ukrainians in the first week of the counteroffensive, as Russian soldiers generally held their ground in heavily fortified and mined positions. But military analysts said Kyiv had so far committed a fraction of the 12 brigades it had held in reserve. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said in its daily report on Sunday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ukrainian forces are currently attempting an extraordinarily difficult tactical operation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a frontal assault against prepared defensive positions, further complicated by a lack of air superiority \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and these initial assaults should not be extrapolated to predict all Ukrainian operations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Russian military remains dangerous and Ukrainian forces certainly face a hard fight, but Ukraine has not yet committed the vast majority of its counteroffensive forces and Russian defences are not uniformly strong along all sectors of the frontline.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ISW reported that the area around Velyka Novosilka was one of at least four main directions of Ukrainian attack over the weekend, the others being around Bilohorivka in Luhansk, about 6 miles west of Luhansk city; Bakhmut in northern Donetsk; and western Zaporizhzhia, particularly south of the town of Orikhiv. On the Black Sea, meanwhile, media in Moscow reported that a Russian naval intelligence collection vessel, the Priazovye, had come under attack from six Ukrainian drone boats while it was on patrol guarding the TurkStream and Blue Stream undersea gas pipelines carrying Russian gas exports to Turkey and Europe. The reports said the Priazovye had been able to repel the attack and video footage posted on social media showed guns being fired from a ship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deck at small unmanned boats, one of which exploded. Ukrainian forces are having to pursue the counteroffensive while using some of their resources to help the relief effort in Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, devastated by floods after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam on Tuesday. Six people are confirmed dead on the Ukrainian-held right bank of the Dnipro river, and the interior minister, Ihor Klymenko, announced on Sunday that there were still 35 people missing, including seven children. Klymenko said 77 towns and villages had been flooded in Kherson and Mykolaiv and that 3,700 people had been evacuated. There are believed to be far more deaths on the Russian-held left bank of the Dnipro, where many people in submerged towns and villages were left to fend for themselves. Kyiv has demanded the intervention of the international humanitarian agencies. The UN emergency relief coordinator, Martin Griffiths, said on Friday that his office had been in touch with Russian authorities seeking permission for safe access across the lines. Asked on Sunday if there had been any progress in the discussions, Eri Kaneko, a spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said only: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Efforts continue with both parties to ensure that critical aid can be delivered to the flood-affected areas.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kyiv has been coordinating with the UN over relief supplies since the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collapse, and Ukrainians have tried to evacuate people trapped on the left bank, despite coming under fire from Russian positions. In an attack on one boat, three people were reported to have been killed and 10 injured. Ruslan Strilets, Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environmental protection minister, said the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s destruction, widely believed to have been an act of sabotage by Russian forces who had control of the hydroelectric station at the site, had deprived 1 million Ukrainians of drinking water."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/12/wedding-mitchell-gaffney-maddy-edsell-hunter-valley-bus-crash-greta-nsw", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Community reeling as \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfairytale\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hunter Valley wedding turns to tragedy after bus crash", "lead": "Mitchell Gaffney and Maddy Edsell had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbeautiful ceremony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, hours before a bus carrying guests overturned on the Hunter expressway", "author": "Christopher Knaus and Caitlin Cassidy", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T06:13:25Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764271", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0f23227fd664b3a35778af897c098d6531cf9b8d/0_182_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Friends of the injured are in shock at the horrific bus crash that killed at least 10 guests of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fairytale\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wedding for a couple described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well-loved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beautiful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd people.

They started the car up at the accommodation and drove it \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 in through Wandin gates and down the grass onto the ceremony \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was so cool to see her rock up in this bug.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Both keen footballers, Gaffney and Edsell belong to the Singleton men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teams, the Roosters and Roosterettes. Prior to moving north, Gaffney also played for the Warrandyte cricket club, in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The club said roughly eight players and five of their partners were up in the Hunter Valley for Gaffney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wedding. Club president, Royce Jaksic, said members of the club were in shock.

Some had suffered less-serious injuries, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We probably had 13 or 14 people on the bus out of 37, for that to be the case is just a blessing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told Guardian Australia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Someone was looking after them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jaksic was not president when Gaffney played at the club. But he said it was clear his family were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153certainly well-loved in the community\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been stalwarts in the community for a long period of time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just goes to show that, five or six years later, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a heap of guys going up to the Hunter Valley to celebrate his wedding. So well respected, well-loved young man.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One man who said he was at the wedding, but not on the bus, told the Seven Network guests had started panicking when they learned of the crash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a nice day, pretty good wedding, fairytale stuff, then \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we got the news there had been a crash and we all started panicking,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Wandin Valley Estate was closed on Monday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Out of respect Wandin Valley Estate will be closed today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a sign on the gates read. The estate said in a statement that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply saddened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the crash. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends of the victims, and we are supporting them in any way we can,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the statement said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At this time, we are providing support to those guests who need our help, and we wish to maintain their privacy and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be making any further statements at this time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One wedding videographer, who worked regularly at Wandin, said the events were always \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full of fun and laughter, right to the very end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I cannot but feel the sadness that must be surrounding this young couple on their wedding day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the videographer said on social media.

Firstly, are you OK? What a weekend. The Conservative party is again on the edge of civil war after one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most divisive politicians decided he was bowing out, before the electorate could push. Less than four years after he won an 80-seat majority, Boris Johnson is departing parliament. Unlike so many before him, it is not to spend more time with his family, who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t warrant a mention in his bitter resignation. Rather, Johnson dramatically quit on Friday lashing out at the cross-party investigation into the Partygate scandal, which concluded that he had misled parliament and recommended an extended suspension from the House of Commons. This, crucially, would have allowed for a recall petition and a potentially embarrassing byelection in Uxbridge and South Ruislip, where he held a majority of 7,210. Miranda Bryant spoke to his constituents as they said farewell to their local MP. But that was neither the start nor the end of Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekend woes. Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s departure was preceded by Nadine Dorries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation as MP for Mid Bedfordshire after she was left off Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial resignation honours list. And a third was to follow over the weekend, with Nigel Adams, another Johnson ally, deciding he wanted to join in the fun. The melodrama has been music to the Labour party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ears, as Rowena Mason and Aubrey Allegretti reported that Labour sources view the seats of both Dorries and Johnson as winnable. Read Alexandra Topping\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s detailed analysis on the opposition parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chances for more information. To add to the intrigue, Johnson alluded that he might be coming back, writing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is very sad to be leaving parliament \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least for now \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd However, Sunak and the Conservative officials he attacked would have to approve his application as a candidate elsewhere at the next general election \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an unlikely scenario. For a rundown of a weekend in Tory madness, keep reading. First the headlines. Five big stories France | An 11-year-old British girl was shot dead as she played on swings at her family home in Brittany, France on Saturday. Solenne Thornon, 11, died immediately while her father, 52-year-old Adrien, was shot in the head, leaving him in a critical condition in hospital. The girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mother, Rachel, 49, was shot in the back and the head but was reportedly out of danger. Authorities said a 71-year-old Dutch man was taken into custody. French media reported there had been a conflict between the British family and their neighbours over a plot of land. Scotland | Nicola Sturgeon has been questioned by detectives investigating allegations of financial misconduct by the Scottish National party. The former first minister and SNP leader was released without charge, pending further inquiries, after voluntarily going to a police station. She is the third senior figure in the SNP arrested as part of Operation Branchform, which is investigating allegations that more than \u00c2\u00a3600,000 in donations for an independence campaign was misspent by the party. Colombia | The four young Colombian siblings who managed to survive for 40 days in the Amazon jungle after their plane crashed have been reunited with their family as further details emerged of their astonishing feat of endurance. The children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grandfather, Fidencio Valencia, who visited them in the Bogot\u00c3\u00a1 hospital where they are recuperating, said they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shattered but in good hands and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re alive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Society | A new study has found that almost 7% of the UK population has changed their sexual identity over a six-year period. Women aged over 65 are one of the most \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sexually fluid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd groups, challenging the assumption that moving between heterosexual and non-heterosexual identities is more common among younger people. Tony awards | It was a big night for Brits at the Tony awards, after Jodie Comer won best actress in a leading role in a play and Tom Stoppard sprawling family drama Leopoldstadt was named best play. It was also a historic night for non-binary actors: J Harrison Ghee was named best actor in a leading role in a musical and Alex Newell won best featured actor in a musical. In depth: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcKangaroo courts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccowards\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccivil war\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1,000-word resignation was laced with resentment, paranoia and indignation, taking aim at the government, the Labour MP Harriet Harman who led the privileges committee probe into the lockdown-breaking parties, and Sue Gray, the civil servant turned Labour chief-of-staff who first investigated him. Echoing Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rhetoric in the US, Johnson lambasted a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153witch-hunt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd orchestrated by the establishment that pushed him out of office (even though he chose to step down). Read Peter Walker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full analysis of his resignation for more context and examination. Many are clearly happy to see the back of Johnson (for now). Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, called Johnson a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coward\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no respect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the 2019 Conservative voters who put their faith in him. And a diplomat (of all people) reportedly said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Typical Boris. Full of shit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in response to the news. Aubrey Allegretti reported that senior Tories have told Johnson and his allies to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shut up and go away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and yesterday Grant Shapps, a senior cabinet minister, claimed that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153world has moved on\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from Boris Johnson. However, it seems the Conservative party has not. Although Johnson has plenty of foes, he still has a significant number of allies, and they could make things very difficult for Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government. Before we look at what might happen in the future, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a look back at how we got here. *** Where it all began Last Tuesday morning, seven MPs who have been investigating whether Johnson had misled parliament over Partygate unanimously concluded that the former prime minister had indeed, recklessly or deliberately, misled the Commons about what had happened, and on more than one occasion. The full findings will be published later today and are expected to be damning. Even though Johnson has developed something of a reputation for managing to survive scandals, these findings would have been particularly challenging to weather, especially as the committee recommended that Johnson be suspended for more than 10 days. This punishment would have likely resulted in Johnson fighting for his marginal seat in a byelection. After receiving a confidential copy of the findings, Johnson had two real choices: fight or run, while throwing as many stones as possible, and find a hiding place to recoup. Johnson chose the latter, and he did so in the most explosive fashion possible. First, his outrider, Nadine Dorries, announced her resignation, hinting at mysterious goings on that had prompted a reversal in position \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just hours before she said she had every intention of running in the next election. Her failure to be named in Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honours list presumably played a part too, with the suggestion that Sunak had blocked her ascension to the Lords in order to avoid a tricky byelection. Clearly that did not work for the prime minister. And then came the Johnson announcement. He claimed that the inquiry was akin to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kangaroo court\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, run by people who had an egregious bias against him, despite the fact that the majority of those on the committee were from his own party. He was quick to spin a narrative that a cabal of remainers wanted to take \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revenge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for his role in Brexit and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ultimately reverse the 2016 referendum result\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Despite opting to quit before the public and press could see the specifics of the verdict, Johnson has implied that he has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forced out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, fuelling a paranoid narrative that conspiracy is afoot. *** Over the weekend Even though the work week was over, the drama knew no end. As the temperature soared in London on Saturday, Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politically induced headache got a whole lot worse. The prime minister was heavily criticised for clearing Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation honours list, which included many of those involved in the Partygate scandal. Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, who oversaw a garden party during lockdown restrictions in 2020, was knighted with the Order of the Bath for his public service. A peerage was also given to his chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, and a CBE to Jack Doyle, his former director of communications, both of whom were in office during some of the Partygate era of controversy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Aubrey Allegretti\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explainer on why No 10 and Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team were at loggerheads over this list is a great rundown of the situation. Then another of Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies, Nigel Adams, quit parliament, triggering a byelection in Selby and Ainsty. Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antics continued to enrage his former colleagues who accused him of trying to derail the government. Senior officials have been demanding that Sunak ensure that Johnson is barred from standing as a Conservative candidate in the next election. Former Cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Johnson ally who was knighted in his resignation honours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has warned that any attempt to block Johnson could plunge the party into \u00e2\u20ac\u0153civil war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. *** What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next Rishi Sunak has tried to win over his party and the public by being the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd guy. He has spent most of his eight-month premiership attempting to move the party away from the theatrics that defined the previous government. But in one fell swoop, his efforts have crumbled and he is left with three byelections, a new internal war and a press nightmare. As for Johnson, like many disgraced politicians he has a number of options in front of him, as Michael Savage lays out in this explainer. He could get some of that highly lucrative speaker circuit cash like Liz Truss; he could decide he is not done with the government and come back, either in another byelection or in the next general election. He may even go back to his journalistic roots with some well-placed columns. What is clear through his lack of remorse, regardless of his next steps, is that he is unlikely to fade into obscurity. At least for now. What else we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been reading Nick Robins-Early takes a look at the pro-Trump campaign that has been attacking Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental health and how it has begun to accelerate its hostile tactics.

It will significantly lower the threshold for serious disruption, the criteria that allows for police interference with protests, which is currently defined as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prolonged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd disruption to the day-to-day life of the community. The legislation applies to England, Wales and Scotland but not Northern Ireland. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The threshold would be so low that it could lead to police imposing conditions on protests which would breach the rights of protesters,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Adam Wagner, a barrister with Doughty Street Chambers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In my view, this could give the police a far wider, nearing total, discretion as to which processions or assemblies could be made subject to conditions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A protest act as typical as a peaceful march attended by hundreds of people, closing roads and stopping traffic, would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undoubtedly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd be considered serious disruption within the meaning of the proposed changes, Wagner said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Although such conditions can in theory be challenged in advance by judicial review, including on human rights grounds, the reality is that this is well beyond the reach of most protesters as they may lack the time, experience and capacity, it is very costly and such challenges do not generally attract legal aid,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This leaves individuals who want to protest with the choice of simply acquiescing to the conditions restricting their protest or risk arrest, detention and prosecution for breaching them, and hoping to successfully defend any prosecution at trial.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Public Order Act 1986 (Serious Disruption to the Life of the Community) Regulations 2023 will be debated for 90 minutes in the Commons on Monday, and then in the Lords on Tuesday, where it will face a fatal motion tabled by Jenny Jones, the Green party peer. The Lords rejected the same measure just months ago when it was tabled as an amendment to the recent Public Order Act 2023. Its return has raised concerns among peers and senior lawyers about the constitutional implications of the use of secondary legislation to revive measures only recently rejected by lawmakers. Lady Jones said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we allow the government to get away with this repressive change to the laws of protest, which parliament has already rejected, then other ministerial decrees will follow that see major changes to environmental and workplace protections. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the last four years we have passed a huge number of skeleton bills that give ministers the power to make or change laws. This is a shifting of power from parliament to Whitehall. My fatal motion tries to stop ministers taking this power grab on to a new level of government by diktat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Friends of the Earth, who commissioned Wagner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal opinion, and dozens of other campaigning organisations including the Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Institute, the Quakers and Amnesty International, have asked peers to back Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s motion. Dave Timms, FoE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of political affairs, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting that the government has scheduled a debate and vote for Monday in the Commons. Likely they will win that, but I think they are worried about the constitutional issues adding to the opposition to the measure in the Lords and they want to say that the statutory instrument has been approved already by the elected chamber. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Also they will no doubt throw the charge at Labour that they are backing Just Stop Oil, when the reality is that these measures are nothing much to do with JSO. Their slow marches are already seeing police conditions using Section 12 of the Public Order Act 1986 very quickly used against them, with the current definition of serious disruption.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Conservatives have sought to draw links between Just Stop Oil and the opposition Labour party, which has pledged to stop issuing new licences for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the climate campaign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s core demand.

The government said the new legislation was intended to give police the powers to break up slow marching protests. Supporters of the measure said MPs had not voted on it as an amendment to the Public Order Act 2023, but would now have the chance to do so. The Home Office was clear about the reasons for the measure. A spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A handful of selfish individuals should not be able to bring our roads to a halt, day after day and people must be able to go about their lives freely. That is why we are introducing a new definition of serious disruption, to give police the confidence they need to clear roads quickly. We urge parliament to back this new legislation and support our police officers in keeping our country moving.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/12/a-new-start-after-60-living-moment-veena-torchia-vegan-cafe", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "title": "A new start after 60: I left Britain and opened a cafe in India.

As she bit into it, she let the juice drip down her. If she had been in east London, where her family is based, she would have cut the mango into pieces on a nice plate. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have tasted it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. Torchia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senses have sharpened since she turned 60 last year and moved to Pushkar with her husband to open a vegan cafe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first, she claims, in the whole of the state of Rajasthan. It was in Pushkar that Torchia and Maurelio, who is from Calabria, Italy, became a couple 40 years ago, having travelled there as friends in their 20s. It was a very different India from the one Torchia knew from childhood visits to her father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family, when it was all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big hotels, air-conditioned buildings, jewellery shopping\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When she and Maurelio returned to the city last autumn, they went to a hotel they knew. The owner had space in the garden in which they could run a cafe and the couple rented a bedroom for \u00c2\u00a35 a night. The owner told them: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Make your tofu; do your whatever.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Two weeks later, they opened the Arty Vegan cafe. In Pushkar, Torchia says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a can-do attitude. No matter how little you have, everything is possible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a spirit she is trying to harness. Torchia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clients are a mix of tourists, businesses, yoga retreats that book for groups, and walk-in customers. In the first half of the week, they prepare their homemade tofu, soya milk and dishes based on okara (soya pulp), and as the weekend approaches the menu switches to dishes from around the world. Customers can bring a container and buy food to take home. Torchia was born in South Africa but at eight moved to London with her mother and younger sister. Her father, who had an Esso franchise, stayed behind and sent money for the girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 education. But living in England \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was a grim and isolating experience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In Durban, under apartheid, Torchia experienced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very institutionalised segregation. But I did know which bench to sit on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In Dulwich, south London, the racism \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was much more subtle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and some of the signs harder to spot. Not at school, though, where she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was the only brown girl\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. People joked that she was the lavatory cleaner. There was always \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this sense of feeling valueless\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She self-harmed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had anorexia, bulimia, in those teenage years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maurelio, who was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very much into cooking and did his exams to be a restaurateur\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, was the catalyst for her recovery. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He showed me unconditional love,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. When they married, Torchia worked full-time in overseas education posts with the British Council while Maurelio looked after their four daughters. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For about 25 years, we travelled,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says: Turkey, Sri Lanka, India, Tunisia, Japan. They came back to England for each birth, but there was a nagging sense of not belonging. This became more than a feeling when the family returned to England hoping to spend time with Torchia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother, only to become homeless. Spells in a succession of B&amp;Bs followed, before they were offered accommodation by a housing association in Hackney. Torchia started working for the homelessness charity Crisis, first as a teacher, then as manager of learning. Her upbringing had given her a sense of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a very linear progression. You move from A to B and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get to C you are a failure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But daily life was full of disorder, challenge and pressure. When she got breast cancer five years ago, the diagnosis hit hard. There had been no lump, no obvious sign. But, she says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was always living under so much stress. I thought it was the end of the world when I went for radiotherapy each day. I felt very isolated.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But in Pushkar she feels at home. The Arty Vegan began life as a food label in Hackney during lockdown, with Maurelio making tofu and their second daughter making vegan cheese. Their products were stocked in Planet Organic and Whole Foods Market. Now, some people who find the cafe in Pushkar recognise the name. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I used to feel I needed to belong somewhere, or needed to identify with something, or needed to conform,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Torchia says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I felt quite battered. You perk yourself up, but you constantly feel this very heavy feeling. Now, for the first time, I feel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m my own person.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Their room in Pushkar is simple. The bathroom leaks, the paint peels, the bed is basic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I really couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be happier,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am learning each day to shed the traumas of the past, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m finally living for the moment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In the UK, Beat can be contacted on 0808 801 0677.

We haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fallen apart, split up or sunk into desperate sadness. We missed them, but they seemed happy enough, so we were happy for them. However, their absence has made us \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 what? Odd? I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it: odd. For a start, they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been back since we installed two chairs in front of the glass door to the garden, where we now spend all our free time, like Statler and Waldorf from the Muppets, commenting, usually unfavourably, on the local birds.

While the sample may seem ordinary, to the biologist it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a trove of secrets: the DNA of every living creature swimming below. He presses the water sample through a filter about the size of his hand, which captures the DNA fragments, then repeats the process several more times. Meters away, a sea turtle emerges for a breath then retreats to the seagrass meadow below. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Without disturbing the environment, we can take a sample that tells us exactly what was at this site,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jiyed says. Scientists and students take water samples at Banc d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arguin national park in Mauritania Over the past decade, the use of environmental DNA \u00e2\u20ac\u201c known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eDNA\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to monitor biodiversity has surged. As animals move through their environment, they shed fragments of genetic material: skin cells, waste products and other body fluids. By extracting these minute traces of DNA from samples of water, soil or air, scientists can determine the presence and diversity of species with unprecedented accuracy, providing a snapshot of the intricacies of an ecosystem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Knowledge is the basis of all management. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know a place, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t protect it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jiyed says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the first step.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His efforts are part of a Unesco initiative to collect eDNA across 22 marine world heritage sites, including Mauritania\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Banc d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arguin national park, where he works. Traditional fishing boats in the Banc d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arguin are powered by sail The park is nestled along the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s north coast, where Saharan sand dips into emerald waters. Fishing boats propelled only by sail glide past low-lying islands. The penetrating silence is misleading: this place is home to endangered dolphins and sea turtles and is a vital stopover for millions of migratory birds. Due to its remarkable biodiversity, the park was granted world heritage status by Unesco in 1989. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true biogeographic crossroads\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which marks the meeting of tropical and temperate organisms, says the park director, Ebaye Sidina. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know that we have an enormous number of species, and the DNA analysis will finally lift the veil and show that this diversity is there and must be preserved,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Biologist Nahi El Bar Jiyed takes a water sample and filters eDNA The eDNA technology not only allows scientists to assess biodiversity, but to detect invasive species, track endangered or elusive animals and to monitor wastewater for diseases and pathogens. It has even uncovered the existence of species previously thought to be extinct. At Banc d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arguin, scientists are eager to see if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s any indication of the smalltooth sawfish, which Sidina said hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been seen in decades. Used over time, eDNA can provide insights into how the climate crisis is affecting populations, such as by shifting their geographic range. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Several fish species are already moving 25km every decade, either to deeper waters or further from the equator,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Fanny Douvere, head of the world heritage marine programme at Unesco. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to make sure that in another 30 to 40 years, the boundaries of these marine world heritage sites will still be relevant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Analysis of eDNA offers several advantages over traditional surveys, particularly when assessing the effects of climate changes on an ecosystem. Whereas traditional surveys can take years to complete, eDNA analysis can yield results within months, says Ward Appeltans, head of the ocean biodiversity information system at Unesco and science coordinator of the eDNA expeditions initiative. Fiddler crabs are common on Banc d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arguin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extensive mudflats. They are a vital source of food for birds such as terns and herons \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ocean\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s status is changing so rapidly,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to know what its status is now, not five years ago.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The ability to detect immediate changes is also crucial for tracking invasive species, such as lionfish, which can quickly overtake native fish populations. Moreover, eDNA sampling offers a noninvasive alternative to harmful standard survey methods, such as bottom trawling and the capturing, tranquilising and tagging of animals. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eDNA will also pick up things that you maybe wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have seen because they were hiding or only show up at certain times of day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Luke Thompson, a researcher at Mississippi State University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Miami, Florida. Traditional marine and aerial surveys also tend to be far more expensive, as they require boats, helicopters, planes and crew. During the winter months, Banc d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arguin welcomes more than 2 million migratory birds, some from as far afield as Siberia or Greenland However, eDNA technology does present its own challenges. Ocean currents can prevent species in the sample region from being detected, or cause others in far-off areas to appear present. Some animals shed more DNA than others, which can paint an inaccurate picture of population ratios. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But the main limitation is the lack of consensus about standardising methods and markers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Louis Bernatchez, editor-in-chief of scientific journal Environmental DNA. In order to match collected DNA to the corresponding species, scientists run the genetic sequences through a reference database. However, a unified global database does not exist, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no consensus regarding which genetic markers to use. As it is, less than 1% of all animals have had their genomes sequenced. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sufficiently working together,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bernatchez says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big problem.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Unesco, for its part, plans to upload all data from its eDNA initiative to its open science marine species database. The whale skeleton outside the Iwik patrol post is a testament to Banc d\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Arguin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rich biodiversity Despite the drawbacks, scientists around the globe continue to apply the technology in innovative ways.

The analysis, which is explained fully further down the page, has been conducted based on a typical local income. Readers can find out which areas are affordable for their individual, couple or family salary and an assumed deposit using this interactive tool. Close to half of the postcode districts (48%) included in the research are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rental traps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c areas in which a family cannot afford to buy a mid-price property. In a further 11% of the areas it is not only unaffordable to buy but also to rent because the cost eats into a disproportionate amount of the household\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s income, based on widely accepted affordability criteria. The data, which is sourced from the marketing services company TwentyCi, gives the most detailed picture yet of the asking prices in 2,400 British postcode districts in the year to 4 June. The number is roughly 85% of all postcode districts in Great Britain. Property prices are outstripping the loan-to-income ratio required by most banks, which is typically 4.5 times a couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joint salary. They have eased a little over the past year across the UK as the cost of living crisis affects the market, yet still remain close to historical highs. After years of prices accelerating at a faster pace than wages, the affordability gap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the difference between people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings and the cost of the properties available to buy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has risen significantly. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that, while earnings in England and Wales have doubled since 1997, house prices have increased at a much faster pace, multiplying by 4.5 times over the same period. In the year to September 1997 a mid-range house in England cost 3.5 times the median full-time salary \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ie the one at the midpoint when all incomes are put in ascending order of size. By 2022 that ratio had grown to 8.3 times a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s median earnings. While the Guardian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s analysis assumes a prospective buyer has a 10% deposit, saving for one is often a huge barrier for first-time buyers because of rents eating up an increasing proportion of people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wages, and because of inflationary pressures on food and energy prices. Rising rents and property prices have meant more people are forced to rent for longer, with the average age of a first-time buyer increasing over time: it stood at 34 in England in 2021-22. Given many people have started a family before this age, first-time buyers are often seeking two- or three-bedroom properties. The analysis casts light on just how inaccessible the housing market can be in certain parts of the country, especially London. A couple earning the median local wage are stretched beyond their means if they wish to rent or buy in 63% of the capital\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s postal districts. A further 36% of areas are affordable for the same couple to rent \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but they will use up at least 20% of their combined wages in doing so. This leaves just 1% of districts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in pockets of Bexley, Bromley, and Greenwich \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where a couple can afford to either rent or buy a mid-range property. The problem is not confined to the capital. Most districts in the east, south-east and south-west of England are deemed unaffordable for local couples to buy or rent. In Bristol the figure is close to a quarter, while in some larger towns such as Oxford all are out of reach. By contrast, 92% of Scottish postcode districts for which data is available were affordable for typical local couples to either rent or buy based on asking prices, closely followed by the north-east of England at 88%. The analysis is based on the median value of all properties on the market to rent or buy in the 12 months to 4 June 2023. While this data provides the most accurate and up-to-date picture of asking prices in the housing market, an area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s median price can be affected by the size of the properties on the market during this period. The analysis excludes areas that have either a very low number of properties for rent or sale, which has led to the exclusion of some postal districts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c marked in white on the interactive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c especially in rural and remote areas. David Hollingworth, a mortgage expert with the brokers L&amp;C, said the analysis highlighted the housing market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge barriers to entry: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Saving is hard enough but when trying to support a high monthly rental payment at the same time many will feel that they are running to stand still. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153First time buyers will often feel frustrated that they are paying a rent that is bigger than a potential mortgage payment but find it hard to meet the affordability requirements \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Higher interest rates will only make home ownership harder and is also likely to exert upward pressure on rents as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Francesca Albanese, the acting director of policy and external affairs at the charity Crisis, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The housing market is barely a market anymore. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a rat race. With the constant focus on seeing house prices increase, we have ignored what this research so clearly shows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that more people are being priced out of the market altogether. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Huge swathes of Great Britain are now completely out of reach for the average family, particularly first-time buyers. House prices and rents have shot up while wages have remained stagnant, leaving countless families having to watch their dreams of owning a home go up in smoke.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Colin Bradshaw, the chief executive of TwentyCi, said the low supply of affordable new builds for first time buyers was exacerbating the issue: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For those trying to make the leap from the rental sector to owner occupied, the persistence of high inflation leading to higher interest rates and consequently more costly mortgages amplifies the gap.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A government spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Supporting aspiring homeowners is a government priority. Since 2010, over 837,000 households have been helped to purchase a home through government-backed schemes including Help to Buy and Right to Buy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have extended the mortgage guarantee scheme a year further to December 2023. This has already helped over 35,000 households with 5% deposits and we are progressing the levelling up and regeneration bill to speed up the planning system, cutting unnecessary delays so we can build more homes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have delivered more than 2m homes since 2010, and we are committed to delivering 300,000 new homes per year. This is why we are investing \u00c2\u00a311.5bn to build the affordable, quality homes this country needs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Methodology The rental and property purchase prices are sourced, deduplicated and verified by TwentyCi. The map file is sourced from Edinburgh Datashare. Sales are defined as the asking prices for properties listed as for sale, sold or subject to contract between 5 June 2022 and 4 June 2023. Rentals are defined as the asking prices for rents in the same period, including those where a let has been agreed. Filters have been applied to exclude mobile homes, auction properties, shared ownership properties, land or site sales, retirement homes and properties used for short-let purposes, wherever possible. Data for Northern Ireland was not available. The analysis is based on the median property cost per postcode district, excluding postcode districts where there were fewer than 20 properties for either sale or rent in the period covered by the analysis. Proportions (eg 48% of postal districts) are based on the total number of districts which met this criteria: 2,407 postal districts in total. Earnings are defined as the median gross annual pay of its surrounding local authority in 2022, as sourced from the ONS. Where a postcode district falls into more than one local authority, the salary amounts are drawn from local authority with the highest number of postcodes within that district. In a small number of cases, a local authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pay data was unavailable. In these cases median property prices were compared to the regional median income. The analysis is based on a household that has two working adults that each earn this median gross annual pay of the surrounding local authority. Affordability is defined as follows: Sales: a property is considered affordable if the mortgage (defined as 90% of the median property price) does not exceed 4.5 times a couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s combined salary (as described above). The analysis assumes the prospective buyers are able to raise a deposit (10% of the mortgage price). Rents: rentals are considered affordable if it makes up no more than 30% of a couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s median gross monthly pay (as described above). Consideration was given to standardising the data analysis based on a set number of bedrooms. After consultation with experts the decision was taken to base the analysis on the median of all properties in an area compared with the combined income of the median household, in keeping with typical property metrics. As a result, an area\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s median value for rent or buying could be impacted by the mix of housing stock on the market at the time of analysis. For example, the BD1 district had a majority of one-bedroom properties in the analysis, which may be as a result of a number of one-beds coming on the market in the time period covered and not because that was the prevalent property type in that area.

With the average British home now costing about nine times the mid-range income and average monthly rents in the capital and outside London having hit record levels in the first quarter of the year, millions of Britons are living in areas where they can afford neither to buy a mid-priced property, nor to rent a home without spending a disproportionate part of their income, a Guardian analysis has revealed. The leading ratings agency Moody\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has predicted that UK house prices will fall 10% over the next two years, owing to stubbornly high inflation and the recent spike in mortgage rates. One of those feeling the pinch is Clara, a 42-year-old secondary school teacher and mother of two teenagers, who rents a three-bedroom house in Hemel Hempstead for \u00c2\u00a31,450 a month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The rent makes up 40% of mine and my partner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s joint take-home income,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says, which puts it above the 30% threshold that the Affordable Housing Commission defines as affordable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our rent just rose again a month ago, because the landlord\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mortgage payments increased. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rents here have always been quite high, but have gone up a lot in the area over the last 10 years. There is a very large and growing group of people here who earn too much to access any form of housing benefit, but not enough to pay rent and the bills.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In order to stay close to their children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s schools, the couple have had to use credit cards and loans to keep on top of bills. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve racked up about \u00c2\u00a313k of debt over time, just to pay our basic living costs, like petrol, food and rent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clara says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We both work full-time, cannot save. We felt that we had no choice.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clara is one of dozens of people who responded when the Guardian asked readers in Britain whether they could afford their housing costs. Tony Mono, 63, who had to give up work as a graphic designer two years ago due to health issues, moved to St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, from Wolverhampton in 1995. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Until about four years ago, it was more or less affordable to live here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now, I could become homeless.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mono, who has been renting an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment from a private landlord since 2009 for \u00c2\u00a3495 a month, now faces eviction as the owner wants to sell. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been looking at flats since June last year, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been virtually impossible to even get a viewing, even after I offered six months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rent upfront,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told by estate agents I need to earn 30 times the monthly rent, which is ridiculous. Not many locals here will be on that kind of money, but you need \u00c2\u00a327,000 now to rent in one of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poorest coastal towns.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Over the past 10 years, Mono says, there has been a steady influx of home-buyers from London, and much of the available rental property has been turned into holiday lets. The maximum rent he could pay, he says, would be \u00c2\u00a3750, which would be 67% of his monthly universal credit award of \u00c2\u00a31,118. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been able to budget on a low income, but now my situation is unsustainable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While spiralling rents make life a struggle for millions of people in Britain, homeowners are grappling with rising costs, too, in some cases too much to bear. When Barbara*, 42, a single mother who works full time as a marketer in the legal sector, bought her purpose-built two-bed leasehold flat in Chatham, Medway, in 2017, she thought she had made it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a more affordable part of Kent, but it is becoming very unaffordable for me \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 now I will either lose my property, or I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll manage to sell and go back to renting.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Barbara paid \u00c2\u00a3227,000 for her home, having been told her annual service charges would cost \u00c2\u00a3800. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a relatively good income of about \u00c2\u00a32,300 a month, but I now spend about half of my take-home pay on housing costs. My service charges have gone through the roof, and my mortgage payments will go up next March. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to pay even more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She wants to sell up and move to a more affordable rental locally, but worries that finding a buyer could be difficult because of the ballooning service charges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather be spending \u00c2\u00a3900 a month on rent and take my chances with a buy-to-let landlord, this is just too ruinous.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hannah, a 35-year-old management consultant, considers herself \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incredibly lucky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to have bought a home in east London with her partner before the disastrous mini budget of Liz Truss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government last autumn caused mortgage misery for millions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We bought a three-bed property for \u00c2\u00a3760,000 last year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a bargain because it needs lots of work. I pay one third of our mortgage while my partner pays the rest, which reflects our earnings as individuals. My contribution is currently about a quarter of my monthly income. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our mortgage is affordable because we locked in a reasonable rate in August before the Truss debacle. If we had been hit by the interest hikes, we would have pulled out of the sale and stayed in our rented flat in Angel, central London, where we paid \u00c2\u00a32,400 for a two-bed. We moved out east because we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford to buy more than a shoebox in Angel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rents in the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s neighbourhood have been skyrocketing, Hannah says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The two-bed flat next door was rented for \u00c2\u00a32,400, the landlord increased the cost to \u00c2\u00a33,200, so the tenants moved out and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now empty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While housing costs are particularly unaffordable in the south-east and parts of the south-west, householders further north are also struggling. Joe Scott, 26, who works in sales for an insurance brokerage, decided to stay in Leeds after university, and is currently renting a single room in a house with seven other flatmates. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My rent is \u00c2\u00a3535 a month, just over 33% of my post-tax salary of about \u00c2\u00a31,600, including quarterly commission of up to \u00c2\u00a3500,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Housing has become dramatically more expensive since he moved to the city eight years ago, he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the past six years, my rent has basically doubled. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to miss meals, but managing is relatively tough. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been on holiday since 2018. My girlfriend lives in Oxford, I go and see her once a month.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scott says local rates are being driven up by large numbers of students. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The university accommodation blocks are nowhere near big enough, and although many properties have been converted into HMOs, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still huge demand for rooms. My area, Headingley, has almost no families left, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve all been kicked out to create student housing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Scott says his experience with Leeds landlords has been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153awful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My current one has ignored my messages about repairs for weeks. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m moving out in June, and if I want to have a similar room in the area, I know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to pay \u00c2\u00a3600, maybe more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd *Name has been changed"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/12/i-am-homeless-if-this-is-not-my-home-by-lorrie-moore-review-bringing-out-the-dead", "primaryCategory": "books", "title": "I Am Homeless If This Is Not My Home by Lorrie Moore review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bringing out the dead", "lead": "A teacher hits the road with his lover\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corpse in the American\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s droll, philosophical fourth novel, a triumph of tone and imagination", "author": "Abhrajyoti Chakraborty", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T06:00:12Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764288", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5ea0f3540984e9154455fdaf6726f31d64cf2ed1/0_127_2150_1290/500.jpg", "body": "Lorrie Moore is the poet laureate of hospitals: the disinfectant smells in hallways, the fluorescent lights on top of beds, but most of all the evasive humour that afflicts patient, doctor and visitor alike.

Dying was private. But perhaps the mortally ill needed company and should all be sleeping together in the same room. When one person died it was a tragedy. But when two or three people were dying together, it had a chance of becoming a comedy. Not a big chance, but some. Half. Less than half probably.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finn tries his utmost to make his brother laugh, or at least to keep him awake. He starts off by telling Max the story of how he was temporarily suspended from his job after the headteacher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife came on to him. Before long, he is sharing conspiracy theories about the moon landing. Moore excels in these moments, these neurotic but intimate conversations that go nowhere, and the scenes in the hospice are viscerally done. There is Max, with his eyes always fixed on the baseball game on TV, while listening for hours to the latest drama in Finn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life. When Finn reveals that he is still not over his ex-girlfriend, Lily, though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been separated for a year, Max can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t resist being the quintessential older sibling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel sorry for you, man,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he blurts out, forgetting about the oxygen tubes taped up to his nose.

Their banter is alternately droll and philosophical, reminiscent of languorous movies such as Before Sunset and Only Lovers Left Alive. One moment Lily is apologising for her decaying teeth and the worms in her hair (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I guess death is kind of a spectrum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), the next reproaching Finn for never quite grasping her private despair. Moore doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t divulge much about the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s past \u00e2\u20ac\u201c enough, however, to ascertain that theirs was a relationship unequal in love. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a lot of things I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lily brags at one point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because you knew I knew,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finn replies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I want you in the world, where you belong,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Finn tells Lily\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ghost. But of course, that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not with Lily, not with Max. Moore shows that grief and ghosts can be written about persuasively, and wittily, without turning a novel into a horror story. Halfway through his otherworldly odyssey, Finn stops at a hotel where the woman at the front desk doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bat an eye at the fact that he is checking in with a grubby corpse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no strangers to swamp people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the woman shrugs. Sometime after the civil war, the hotel was run by another woman, Elizabeth, and she, too, had once let a dead body stay unburied for days in these rooms. One evening she ended up poisoning an eccentric lodger in his bath, a Confederate supporter who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d shamelessly flirt with her (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do desire that we be better strangers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The next morning she pretended to chance upon the body with her housemaid, who then neglected to inform the sheriff for too long. A century and a half later, Finn discovers Elizabeth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s journal in his room, written in the form of letters to her dead sister. Moore has primed the reader in advance for this encounter by inserting excerpts from her letters throughout the novel. In one of Moore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earliest stories, How to Become a Writer, the narrator recalls the time her high school English teacher returned a story she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d submitted with the comment that she lacks a sense of plot. The narrator went home and scribbled below the teacher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s note: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Plots are for dead people, pore-face.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Moore has lived up to this credo in her shorter fiction; her marvellously uneventful tales of dating, illness and loss are often propelled by a zany voice. Her novels, though, have been ambitious in a different way. A Gate at the Stairs, published in 2009, was expansive and featured a dead child, a mixed-race adoption, and a boyfriend who turns out to be a terrorist. Her latest novel is of course about dead people and therefore has a plot, and yet Moore manages to pack in a civil war-era legend, a brother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s final moments in a hospice, and a road novel in less than 200 pages. I Am Homeless is a triumph of tone and, ultimately, of the imagination. For Moore, death doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily mark the end of a story. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 I Am Homeless If This Is Not My Home by Lorrie Moore is published by Faber (\u00c2\u00a316.99).

Jeff Salmon, an art collector who has appeared on a number of Channel 4 shows, was told he was not required at the filming of the relevant auction scenes on the primetime show after he pointed programme producers to the testimony of a firm that had managed the piece. Salmon had offered to stand up during the filmed sale to denounce the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banksy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a forgery. This suggestion was rejected and Salmon, 70, was informed shortly afterwards that he would not be needed for the following day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s filming due to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a lot of last-minute changes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he claimed. The show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s producer, Curve Media, denied there was any link between Salmon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments to its chief executive, Camilla Lewis, and a decision to leave him out of the auction of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banksy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd piece. A spokesperson for C4 and Curve Media said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Jeff wanted to stand up and stop the auction declaring the work to be not genuine. We already knew there were issues around the Banksy and that these were going to feature in the programme. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Furthermore, the auctions are not produced and therefore Camilla explained his \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplay\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appropriate. The information from Jeff was passed on to the production team who again looked into the work\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s provenance but were unable to find anything beyond this small mention on that particular website. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The production team spoke to a number of experts and could not get a definitive answer as to whether this was or was not genuine so the inclusion of the work in the programme was framed around the fact these pieces are selling for huge sums of money despite this uncertainty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The spokesperson added that the choice of dealers invited on the show \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evolved\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over the two weeks of filming. They said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we reviewed the first week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auctions, Jeff featured so heavily that it was decided we would not need him for that sale. Jeff was never booked to feature in the Banksy auction. In the finished series, Jeff appears in almost every episode and he has not been singled out in any way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd During the programme, two on-screen dealers raised doubts about the accreditation of the work on sale to Banksy. The difficulty of being certain about the piece\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authenticity was discussed in the show commentary. But the programme\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auctioneer described it as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Banksy on the Greatest Auction\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and Robin Barton, who subsequently successfully bid for the piece, responded saying he had taken comfort from a lack of claims of authorship from anyone else. Immediately after the programme was broadcast, a street artist in Liverpool, known as Silent Bill, claimed he was the real creator of the piece, which was taken down from a carpark in 2016. It has now emerged that, unknown to Barton, Salmon had also spoken to Lewis shortly before the sale. Salmon had found the contentious art on a website of a company called Sincura, which was paid by a property development company in 2016 to remove it from the car park wall in Liverpool and to then manage its restoration. Sincura confirmed it took the piece down and had restored it and that they did not believe it to be an authentic Banksy. Salmon had informed Lewis in a phone call on 26 October 2022 that Sincura\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website was openly describing the piece as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a genuine Bansky\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcIf you want to make television, I would be happy to stand up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo, no. This is our major piece, the major lot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Salmon said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcFine do whatever you want with the information. Here is the site\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I guided her to the site and it was, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThank you very much\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. I was then later told I was not needed for the next couple of days. I was thinking, why not?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After being stood down, Salmon emailed Lewis to express his concern. He wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153To be frank, I am feeling victimised because of the information that I passed you yesterday. I sincerely hope that my not having been invited to today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s auction has nothing to do with that conversation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lewis responded: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is no correlation. So sorry for the inconvenience.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Barton, a leading expert on Bansky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work, told the Guardian he had not known about the claims on Sincura\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website ahead of the auction but that he did not believe he had been misled. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe there is enough doubt thrown on it that it is makes me nervous but I stand by the fact that until someone proves it is not Banksy it remains Banksy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The artwork was of a stencilled rat, a well-known Banksy character, alongside the words: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I never liked this Banksy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It was one of a number accredited to Silent Bill in a self-published book of his art in 2017 and in a second book by artist John D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122oh published by Tangent books in 2018."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jun/12/stranded-at-the-airport-after-goldcar-refused-our-paper-uk-driving-licences", "primaryCategory": "money", "title": "Stranded at the airport after Goldcar refused our paper UK driving licences", "lead": "Hire car firm refused to honour a prepaid booking and rival firms had no spare vehicles", "author": "Zoe Wood", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T06:00:12Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764292", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d946b908fbf85b05b8197c18217df83304dae43d/0_364_4545_2727/500.jpg", "body": "I was recently left stranded at Toulouse airport with my wife in tears after Goldcar refused to honour our prepaid booking because her paper driving licence was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not a valid document\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We have never had this problem before, and other firms based there, including Hertz, Budget, Alamo and Enterprise, all said they would accept it but had no cars available to hire. We eventually managed to source a car from Avis at an additional cost. However, I later found a Consumer Champions column where Goldcar confirmed it would accept a paper licence alongside another form of picture ID, such as a passport. I contacted Goldcar but the call handler I spoke to was of the same opinion as the agent at the airport, so if that really is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policy, its staff have not been informed. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we have been treated fairly and am almost \u00c2\u00a3350 out of pocket. Can you help? AB, Glasgow When I wrote about a similar Goldcar case in February, the company said it was going to update its processes so UK travellers with paper licences could satisfy its conditions by providing a separate ID picture, such as a passport. That this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen in reality is perhaps no surprise given that Goldcar is regularly rated among the worst car hire firms in Which?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual survey. Goldcar says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unfortunately, the rental agent was incorrect in refusing the UK paper licence, which is acceptable in France. Staff training will also be reviewed to ensure customers have the best possible rental experience.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It has issued a refund of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac425 (\u00c2\u00a3366), which is the difference between the cost of your original booking and the Avis hire, plus a small goodwill gesture. In 2015, the paper counterpart to the photocard driving licence was abolished, although paper licences issued before 31 March 2000 are still valid. But is it worth the jeopardy they introduce into what is an increasingly expensive business anyway (Which? says a week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car hire in August will cost 77% more on average this year than it did in 2019)? In the past I have advised paper licence holders to study a car hire firm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ID conditions before travelling but careful preparation has not prevented incidents such as this. It costs \u00c2\u00a320 to switch to a photocard or \u00c2\u00a35.50 for an international driving permit, and seems money well spent to me if it avoids a spoiled holiday.

Nearly three-quarters (73%) of women said they received no information or advice on bonding with their baby in the first few weeks after birth, despite guidance for doctors and nurses recommending that they assist with emotional attachment to encourage healthy child development. The respondents said societal pressure to enjoy pregnancy, and assumptions that bonding would happen automatically, left them feeling guilty and afraid when it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t, according to a survey of more than 1,000 mothers, undertaken by the Parent-Infant Foundation. Factors that can affect bonding during pregnancy include the mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physical and mental health and past trauma, such as baby loss. Tamora Langley, head of policy at the Parent-Infant Foundation, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We understand staff are under huge time pressures, but checking on emotional wellbeing as well as physical wellbeing needs to become the norm. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With training, a wider range of professionals and practitioners should be able to have conversations about emotional attachment and bonding. Parents who are struggling may need specialist parent-infant relationship support, but they can only get that if they are confident to speak up in the first place. We must challenge the myth of the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcperfect parent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, so that pregnant women feel able to ask for help when they need it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Royal College of Midwives chief executive, Gill Walton, said staff shortages meant midwives often did not have time to help with bonding. She called for a national strategy to recruit and train more midwives so that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153these vital areas of care become the norm\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. One woman in the survey said that despite having a number of pregnancy losses before a healthy pregnancy, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no one seemed to understand or even mention that it might be hard to think about building a relationship with our baby in case the worst happened again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Another said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought there was something wrong with me because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t instantly love my son, and everyone else says things like \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the most magical time giving birth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The survey found that 71% of respondents would have liked more support during pregnancy to bond with their baby, while 64% said nobody talked to them about bonding during their antenatal care. Andrew Whitelaw, an emeritus professor of neonatal medicine at the University of Bristol, said a growing focus on identifying psychiatric problems in mothers, since suicide is the most common cause of maternal mortality in the UK, meant that midwives \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not want to increase anxiety before delivery by talking up difficulties with bonding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Rather than discussing potential challenges with bonding before birth, one of the most effective ways of encouraging bonding was personal contact, including putting the baby skin-to-skin naked between the mothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 breasts for an hour or so after delivery, he said. An NHS spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We encourage services to keep up to date with the latest Nice guidance so they can provide the best level of care to women and their babies.

He tells people he is also worried about his mortgage, the cost of his weekly shop, and he also has family members on NHS waiting lists. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think what matters most to people at the moment, is that I understand what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going through, I get what they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re frustrated about,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People feel really abandoned by politicians, really let down by lots of the promises that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had over the last 15 years.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The former charity worker \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he recently gave up his job as head of policy and campaigns at the National Aids Trust \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also stresses his local roots. He has been a councillor in Camden for a decade, but was born in Hillingdon hospital and grew up in South Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. He hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always wanted to be an MP, but underwent a political awakening in his teens, watching his single mother work two jobs and still struggle to make ends meet. The family was made homeless twice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to fight, I worked incredibly hard to get on, to be the first in my family to go to university, to get a decent job,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I believe that the point of MPs and the point of government is to make it easier to get on and achieve your potential. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got that, it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got people on our side, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got our backs, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making it easier for us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labour are throwing everything at Uxbridge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national campaigns coordinator, Shabana Mahmood, and the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, were in the area on Saturday to begin campaigning less than 24 hours after the Johnson quit. Beales knows there will be a huge amount of attention on the west London suburb until polling opens, and says he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excited for the conversations ahead. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think we just have to make the case to those people who perhaps haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t voted for us before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who are really fed up, but not sure what to do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that they can put their trust in us,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. Does he expect to be standing in parliament making his maiden speech in the near future? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People are incredibly fed up, they are saying they want change. So I think it is entirely possible for Labour to win this seat for the first time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we are not taking anything for granted.

Despite the supposed plastics backlash inspired by TV shows such as the BBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Blue Planet, big water brands are forecast to chalk up growth of more than 10% over the next four years, equivalent to an extra 280m bottles, a new report by the consultancy Retail Economics says. The report, commissioned by campaigners \u00e2\u20ac\u201c including the groups Refill and Whale and Dolphin Conservation as well as the filter firm Brita \u00e2\u20ac\u201c argued that brand advertising played a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153critical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd role in burnishing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153desirability\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of bottled water. The creation of dedicated brands has seen bottled water consumption in the UK increase from just one 300ml can per head in the mid-1970s to 37 litres a head in 2021, according to Retail Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chief executive, Richard Lim. Britons spent \u00c2\u00a31.6bn on branded and supermarket own-label bottled water in 2021. This used about 3.5bn bottles, or 10m a day, Lim estimates. Brands are the driving force behind the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth, accounting for \u00c2\u00a31bn of sales and 2.5bn bottles. Buoyed up by advertising, this footprint could be 2.8bn bottles by 2026, Lim said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to make changes to turn the tide on this issue before it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too late,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Lim of the white paper, which recommends restricting advertising and promotions and putting environmental labels on bottles. While carrying a reusable water bottle has become the norm for many people, the study found that just over half of the UK population, or 51%, drink bottled water once a week or more. The frequency was highest among millennials, at 61%, based on a sample of more than 2,000 households. The research established that more than half of all bottled water was being drunk at home or at work, places where tapwater is readily available. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Plastic bottled water is a scar on our society,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said David Hall, the UK managing director of Brita. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Plastic bottled water takes about five seconds to make, five minutes to use, and a staggering 500 years to break down in landfill. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the main culprits of the worldwide plastic pollution crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While in recent years multipacks of baked beans, soup and tuna have been stripped of plastic packaging, the study found that 90% of bottled water on a typical supermarket shelf was still encased in a wrapper. This plastic-on-top-of-plastic accounts for 1m pieces of wrap every day. A small number of big companies are behind the majority of branded bottled water sales in the UK. They include Highland Spring; Danone, which owns Volvic and Evian; and Nestl\u00c3\u00a9, owner of Buxton mineral water. The report suggested that the Advertising Standards Authority and Competition and Markets Authority should review the environmental claims and credentials of bottled water manufacturers. The authors recommended that the government should treat bottled water in the same way as it does foods sold in England that are high in fat, salt or sugar, removing them from prominent positioning in shops. On packaging, it says wrappers on multipacks are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tantamount to a plastic bag\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and should be treated like one. It suggests a 10p charge under existing plastic bag levies, or that they should be treated like plastic straws and stirrers, which are banned. A spokesperson for Danone UK &amp; Ireland said its Evian and Volvic brands \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enable consumers to make healthier hydration choices they can enjoy conveniently\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that in the UK and Ireland it had committed to using 100% recycled plastic in its bottles by 2025. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Increasing recycling rates also have a role to play, and a unified, consistent deposit return scheme is vital to this. Any restrictions on advertising for the category would risk inadvertently driving consumers towards less healthy beverage options.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A spokesperson for the Natural Source Water Association (NSWA), the UK industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trade body, said its members were focused on reducing their packaging footprint."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/12/the-pleasure-principle-is-a-little-bit-of-indulgence-the-secret-to-success", "primaryCategory": "science", "title": "The pleasure principle: is a little bit of indulgence the secret to success?", "lead": "The latest research shows delayed gratification is not always a guarantee of wellbeing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c carefully planned moments of pleasure can be hugely beneficial", "author": "David Robson", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T05:00:12Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764302", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/dac60de2bbed6709c7884d84875b28fb1ac26810/0_0_5000_3000/500.jpg", "body": "We may live in a largely secular society, but the Protestant work ethic is still alive and strong.

They spend too much and save too little \u00e2\u20ac\u201c behaviour that is not only harming their future prospects, but those of the world economy. We should have the grit of our elders, apparently \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t scared to suffer some hardship with the promise of a better life ahead. Except they too are coming under criticism for enjoying the life that they struggled to earn. According to the UK chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, it is time for the over-50s to put away their golf clubs and start contributing to the economy again. The gospel of self-restraint clearly runs very deep in the cultural psyche and, until recently, psychological research had seemed to confirm that delayed gratification was indeed the secret to long-term success. Yet some recent research has come to question these ideas. While moderate levels of willpower are almost certainly beneficial, people who attempt to avoid all kinds of indulgences are neither happier, nor healthier. They are not even more successful at achieving their goals. By embracing rather than shunning our short-term desires, and knowing when and how to indulge them, we may enjoy greater wellbeing with no cost to our productivity. The long and the short of it By definition, delayed gratification is the idea that putting off temporary pleasure in the moment will lead to greater contentment once we have met our longer-term targets. The research may be best represented by the famous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153marshmallow test\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, in which children were asked to resist eating one marshmallow immediately with the promise of enjoying two marshmallows a quarter of an hour later. Years later, those who had succeeded in the marshmallow test got better grades at school and progressed more quickly in their careers. The finding proved to be so influential that it inspired education programmes devoted to building character; the idea even infiltrated Sesame Street, as the Cookie Monster learned to deal with his cravings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and taught viewers to do the same. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Me want it but me wait,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he sang in the accompanying electropop pastiche. But does delayed gratification always lead to better wellbeing? Signs that this might not be the case were already apparent in the 1990s. Analysing the state of the evidence, Prof David Funder at the University of California, Riverside found that children who scored well on self-control also grew up to be overly reserved and lacked curiosity. He also pointed to research showing that women with very high levels of self-control tend to be at greater risk of depression, for instance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The correlates of delay of gratification are definitely a mixed bag,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he concluded. Later research suggested that people with the highest levels of self-control may suffer from feelings of regret. They can struggle to appreciate the present moment, and when looking back over their lives, they come to resent the sacrifices they have made. To investigate this possibility, Prof Ran Kivetz of Columbia University and his doctoral student Anat Keinan asked university alumni to reflect on their winter breaks from 40 years previously. The researchers found that the ageing graduates were much more likely to lament having had too much self-control than too little at this key moment in their youth. Their regret over the pleasures that they had missed from being too sensible, such as turning down the chance to travel, was much greater than any guilt over their moments of indulgence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the times they had skipped their studies, spent too much and acted irresponsibly. Interestingly, the researchers found exactly the opposite views among current undergraduates: these students were much more likely to endorse the standard view that self-control was preferable to indulgence. It was only with the perspective of a lifetime that the alumni could recognise how much richer their life might have been if they had practised a little less self-denial. People with low self-control are often said to have a kind of psychological myopia, but Kivetz and Keinan proposed that many suffer the opposite problem \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a psychological longsightedness that leaves them so deeply focused on their future goals, they cannot enjoy all the delicious distractions of the present moment. Strategic indulgence Besides ignoring these long-term regrets, historical psychological research might have overstated the short-term consequences of momentary indulgences. According to one prominent theory, any lapse would only encourage more slip-ups, as we find ourselves falling for further temptations. If you are on a diet, for instance, one slice of cake may soon lead to another, until all your good intentions are in tatters. Similarly, once you start watching videos on YouTube, you may find that the whole morning has passed by without you getting any work done. For this reason, indulgences were seen as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153failures\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that should be avoided. This idea also has religious origins. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This abstinence idea has its roots in Christianity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Prof Lile Jia at the National University of Singapore. Yet recent research shows that intermittently giving in to our desires can often be better for our wellbeing, without putting us on a slippery slope to failure. The trick, it seems, is to plan the indulgences in advance. Consider a study of dieters, aptly titled The Benefits of Behaving Badly on Occasion, conducted by Prof Rita Coelho do Vale at the Cat\u00c3\u00b3lica Lisbon School of Business and Economics in Portugal and colleagues at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. All the participants wished to lose weight and aimed to consume an average of 1,500 calories a day. For those in the control condition, there was no opportunity for variation. Those in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153behaving badly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd condition, however, were asked to eat just 1,300 calories on six days of the week; they could then enjoy a blowout of 2,700 calories on the seventh. Over the first two weeks, the researchers tracked the participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 feelings of motivation and their general mood. They then followed up again one month later to find how much progress they had made. As you might expect of people on calorie-restricted diets, the participants in both conditions lost a few kilos. On average, their body mass index dropped from about 25, which is considered overweight, to about 24, which is just within the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153normal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd category. There were, however, significant differences in their experiences of the diet: the people who had planned those days of indulgence reported more positive feelings and remained more motivated throughout. The participants who simply cut their calories without the treat days, in contrast, seemed to find it much harder work to maintain their self-control and stick to the diet. That could be crucial for a dieter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-term success. Jia has noted similar phenomena in his research comparing the habits of students with high and low grade point averages (GPAs) at US universities. He was interested in the ways that they responded to big-time collegiate sports games \u00e2\u20ac\u201c American football, basketball and baseball. These are an important part of student life in the US, but also a huge distraction from their studies. If successful self-control simply involves avoiding short-term pleasures in the pursuit of long-term goals, then you would expect the high-GPA students to have shunned the matches in the run-up to their exams. To find out if this was the case, Jia and a colleague at Indiana University Bloomington asked 409 students to take an online questionnaire a week before a home basketball game against a long-standing rival team. They reported their general attitudes to basketball, and then gave an hour-by-hour plan for their studies on the day before the game, the day itself and the day afterwards. Overall, the low- and high-GPA students hoped to devote roughly the same amount of time to studying over those three days; the big difference lay in the way they distributed those studies. The more successful students planned to take much more time off on the day of the game, but compensated for that with a few extra hours on the days either side of the match. The low-GPA students, in contrast, planned to skip the game entirely. Crucially, a follow-up study confirmed that the more academically successful students were much more likely to have actively participated in watching the collegiate games and celebrating afterwards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this brought significant pleasure. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were enjoying the activities more,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Jia. That would have then put them in a better psychological state to continue their studies the next day. Jia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest research suggests that the advantages of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strategic indulgence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd may come from an increased sense of autonomy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a finding that may be useful for anyone hoping to avoid procrastination at work. Avoiding guilt There are many ways that we could incorporate this new view of self-control by including a few strategic indulgences into our own lives. We can set up pleasant diversions in a long working day or schedule regular treats during our health kicks. If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re saving money, we may set a date each month to enjoy the odd luxury as a reward for our frugal living. Just as importantly, this research should teach us to look a little more kindly upon those unplanned indulgences that may accidentally take us a step away from our long-term goals. You may think that guilt and self-criticism will help you to learn from your mistakes, but recent psychological literature shows that they are often counterproductive. By increasing our stress levels, and reducing our sense of self-efficacy, these emotions can impair our motivation. You would do much better to treat yourself with a little self-compassion, relishing the pleasure before looking for practical means to get back on track. As the study of university alumni showed, balance is the key \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we should aim to weigh up the needs of our present or future selves to ensure that we are serving the health and happiness of each. And contrary to the self-help puritans, a little bit of hedonism is sometimes exactly what you need.

Velo nicotine pouches, small white bags that people put under their lips, are being pushed by British American Tobacco (BAT), one of the biggest tobacco firms in the world. Since the Guardian raised the issue with Instagram, the social media company owned by Facebook, has removed the content. Analysis of a social media campaign by BAT to promote Velo pouches, conducted between January and May this year by the nonprofit group Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, shows that more than a quarter of their social media audience was between 12 and 24 years old. Eleven influencers published 48 posts to an audience of more than 1.4 million people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the majority of whom were in the UK. According to Klear, a social listening platform that analyses influencer audiences, 28% of the audience viewing this content was under 24. Facebook and Instagram outlaw adverts promoting the sale or use of tobacco or nicotine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unless they are cessation products\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The policy prohibits \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tobacco products, vaporisers, electronic cigarettes, or any other products that simulate smoking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A Meta spokesperson, representing Instagram, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t allow ads or branded content that promotes tobacco-related products on Instagram, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll continue to remove content that breaks our rules, like we did in this case. Brands can post about tobacco-related products, but this is restricted to adults over the age of 18.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Caroline Renzulli, international communications officer for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the marketing was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153totally absurd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for portraying Velo as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cool lifestyle product that you should try out even if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a smoker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is totally shameful that tobacco companies continue to engage in this kind of behaviour on social media \u00e2\u20ac\u201c particularly while claiming that they want to help smokers quit. I find it laughable that any company could claim with a straight face that this content is targeting adult smokers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By using DJs, lifestyle influencers and gamers, BAT is ensuring that they are reaching nonsmokers and potential new customers with these Instagram campaigns. They are equating a highly addictive product with aspirational influencer content.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Velo posts have even included influencers posting under a popular social media format known as GRWM, which stands for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get ready with me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is when influencers film themselves getting dressed to go out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the past few months, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found about a dozen UK influencers who have either appeared on BAT channels to promote Velo or are using their own platforms to push Velo on Instagram,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Renzulli said. One poster was D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122vey, a disco and house DJ based in London, who has 62,000 followers on Instagram. A social media reel involves him performing at a ski resort. The caption says \u00e2\u20ac\u0153giving them a show on the snow. Come with me to Tomorrowlad [sic] winter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is followed by the hashtag #youvegotvelo. The content has since been taken down by Instagram. D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122vey has been approached for a comment. Another video from the DJ includes the caption, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fit check for the @velo.unitedkingdom party! Slay today, Before tomorrow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Billie-Jean Blackett, a model and radio presenter, who has appeared in season five of the Netflix reality show The Circle, also promotes the product. She posted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unlimited vibes for the @velo.unitedkingdom pre party before Tomorrow!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The content has since been taken down by Instagram. Blackett has been approached for comment. Velo originates in Scandinavia but is owned by British American Tobacco. On its website it says it appeals to a broader audience thanks to an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attractive price positioning\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd relative to traditional oral tobacco. Hazel Cheeseman, deputy chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to regulating nicotine-containing products is not keeping pace with industry innovation. Vaping products with wide appeal to children are highly visible up and down every high street as well as online, nicotine pouches have no age of sale and no restrictions on their advertising or promotion. These products are less harmful than smoking, but they still contain an addictive substance, nicotine, and should be appropriately regulated. The government must move with the times.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A BAT spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are clear that our tobacco and nicotine products are for adults only and should never be used by those underage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153BAT\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approach to brand partnerships goes beyond the Advertising Standards Authority\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own threshold on advertising age-restricted products, which requires companies to only work with individuals with an adult audience of at least 75%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When assessing who to engage for our brand partnerships, we require any individuals we work with to be above the age of 25, and BAT conducts due diligence to ensure that the significant majority of an individual\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s followers are above the age of 18.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jun/12/starwatch-holding-out-for-the-hero-hercules", "primaryCategory": "science", "title": "Starwatch: holding out for the hero Hercules", "lead": "This constellation has one of the most attractive globular star clusters and should be visible all month", "author": "Stuart Clark", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T05:00:11Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764306", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/34e83faa105d7476209de6ca11ee4e5bb9b0d50d/170_12_2365_1420/500.jpg", "body": "For those in the northern hemisphere, June is the perfect time to track down the constellation of Hercules, the son of Zeus and the hero of Roman mythology.

Andoh described the lineup of waving royals on the Buckingham Palace balcony as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terribly white\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. With the family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solitary person of colour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Duchess of Sussex \u00e2\u20ac\u201c conspicuous by her absence, Andoh was technically correct. Even so, the comment prompted the highest number of complaints to Ofcom of any broadcast this year. Perhaps Andoh had lost sight of the yawning gap between fiction and fact. Shows such as Netflix\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bridgerton have been applauded for introducing actors of colour into the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terribly white\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd space of costume drama, but some people remain resistant to anything that upsets their ideas of the past (even if those ideas were largely gleaned from costume dramas). We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll come back to Bridgerton. In the meantime, another new show has had people up in arms: Queen Cleopatra, a Netflix docuseries co-produced and narrated by Jada Pinkett Smith. Its sin was to cast a Black actor as the Egyptian ruler: Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Adele James, who is mixed race. Cleopatra has been portrayed many times by white actors, including Vivien Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor and Monica Bellucci, but this supposed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blackwashing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was too much for some \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and not just the usual suspects. Egypt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s antiquities minister, Zahi Hawass, complained: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is completely fake. Cleopatra was Greek, meaning that she was light-skinned, not black.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One Egyptian lawyer even sought legal action to block Netflix in the country for its promotion of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Afrocentric thinking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Cleopatra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s precise pigmentation is up for debate: she was descended from the Greek-Macedonian Ptolemaic dynasty. But, the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s makers argue, the dynasty may have intermarried with local Egyptians over the preceding 250 years, at a time when no one was classified as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153white\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd anyway. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Why shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Cleopatra be a melanated sister?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asked Tina Gharavi, the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And why do some people need Cleopatra to be white? Her proximity to whiteness seems to give her value, and for some Egyptians it seems to really matter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Queen Charlotte, the latest Bridgerton instalment, hangs on a similar scrap of historical speculation: the theory that German-born Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz had African ancestry. Thus, young Charlotte is portrayed by British actor India Amarteifio, who has Ghanaian and German ancestry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I know there are a lot of people who believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s absolutely fact that she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from Black Portuguese royalty,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s creator, Shonda Rhimes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The idea that that would make her their first Black royal was very interesting to me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Queen Charlotte begins with the disclaimer that it is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fiction inspired by fact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all liberties taken by the author are quite intentional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There turn out to be quite a lot of liberties. This prequel chronicles Charlotte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arranged marriage to George III in 1761, which blossoms into real love and ushers in a new era of racial unity in Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just like Harry and Meghan didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The Bridgerton extended universe has always taken a curious approach to race, but in Queen Charlotte it reaches bizarre levels. This parallel 18th-century Britain contains many wealthy Black people, such as the young Lady Danbury and her older, buffoonish, darker-skinned husband (who some have condemned as a racial caricature). These rich Black Britons went to Eton and Oxford, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re told, but are excluded from white aristocratic society. Charlotte and George\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s union prompts what is dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the great experiment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bestowing upper-class titles and acceptance upon these posh people of colour, and thereby bridging Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s racial divide. Racism is vanquished overnight, within the space of a formal dance to a string arrangement of an Alicia Keys track. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With one party,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd George tells Charlotte, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we have created more change, stepped forward more than Britain has in the last century.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite like that in the real world. There were between 10,000 and 20,000 Black people in Britain in the 18th century, but vanishingly few were wealthy. They were primarily men, mostly sailors, soldiers from the American revolutionary war \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who were promised emancipation in return for fighting for the British \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or servants working in the households of white people. Bridgerton doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really do \u00e2\u20ac\u0153poor\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the real elephant in the ballroom is slavery. At the time Queen Charlotte takes place, the brutal mechanics of the slave trade were in full swing. The abolitionist movement was just getting started, but the slave trade was not legally abolished in the British empire until 1807, and slavery itself not until 1833. During George III\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reign, 1.5 million Africans were captured and shipped to plantations in North America and the Caribbean. In 1800, the slave trade made up more than 10% of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s GDP. These are the ill-gotten riches on which Bridgerton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s) world of palaces, parties and gigantic wigs was built, but in the show itself, this side of the story is ignored. There are a few tiny references to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the colonies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but slavery, human rights and abolition are never mentioned. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absurd take on Black history,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Steven I Martin, Black British author and historian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is set at a time when Britain was the largest trader in human lives on the planet. Slavery was central to the British economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Martin accuses Bridgerton of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inviting, or fomenting, the forgetting or overlooking of the realities of that period\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Martin finds Bridgerton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s race fantasy problematic for other reasons: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no other groups to which this absurdity would be applied,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I often offer the example of having a series set in the Germany of the 1930s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all ethnically harmonised simply because the F\u00c3\u00bchrer married, say, a woman of Jewish background. It would just be laughed out. Somehow this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c having people of African origin, expecting us to be happy with this twisted image of ourselves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seems to be acceptable. I find it really, really uncomfortable.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yet the Bridgerton franchise has been hugely successful all over the world \u00e2\u20ac\u201c third and fourth seasons are in the works. For BAME viewers, it is refreshing to see people of colour in aristocratic finery, rather than the rags of servants and enslaved people. For white viewers, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colonial history without the racial baggage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all the gilt, none of the guilt. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bridgerton effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has brought more characters of colour into the zone of historical drama. In addition to Queen Cleopatra, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently had ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sanditon, extrapolated from an unfinished Jane Austen novel, which includes a central Black character who has inherited the fortune of her white, plantation-owning father. ITV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new adaptation of Tom Jones has also featured people of colour. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My concern is that everyone now starts putting Black characters into their productions in ways that reflect our current interests, but that undermine the actual history,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Gretchen Gerzina, historian and author of Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Past. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So much so that people believe that this was the actual history. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the great danger. It gives people a pass to say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOh, it was all right. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suffer and they were wealthy.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alternatives are available. One is the now-widespread practice of colour-blind casting, where race is ignored entirely and actors are cast purely on how well they fit the role. This has been done on the stage for decades, particularly with Shakespeare \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Anglo-Indian Ben Kingsley played Hamlet in 1975 and Adrian Lester played Henry V in 2003. More recently, the practice has made its way into cinema, as in Armando Iannucci\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2019 film The Personal History of David Copperfield, where the eponymous character was played by Dev Patel, or Joel Coen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2021 The Tragedy of Macbeth with Denzel Washington. Colour-blind casting is a way of saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These characters may not have been Black or brown but who really knows? And who really cares?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd All historical drama is a construct made in the here and now, and all pretensions to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accuracy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are at best approximate. Cleopatra did not speak in English, after all, and Georgian Britons often had bad skin and terrible teeth. The other alternative is to seek out true stories of people of colour who lived in these eras. One example is Amma Asante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2013 film Belle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a biopic of Dido Belle, who was born into slavery in the year of George and Charlotte\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marriage, and was raised as an aristocrat in 18th-century London. Another has just hit British cinemas: Chevalier, based on the life of Joseph Bologne, AKA the Chevalier de Saint-Georges, the illegitimate son of a French aristocrat and an enslaved African woman. Bologne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s story seems too extraordinary to be true. Born in 1745 and educated in France, he became a champion fencer, a skilled horse-rider, ice skater, swimmer, dancer, as well as a gifted composer and violinist. US president John Adams declared him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the most accomplished man in Europe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opening scene, the young Bologne, played by Kelvin Harrison Jr, outclasses Mozart in a violin duel. That probably never happened. But, unlike Bridgerton, Chevalier stays true to the racial realities of 18th-century France. Bologne was given the title Chevalier de Saint-Georges by Louis XV and became a music tutor to Marie Antoinette, but despite his attempts to assimilate, he was never truly accepted. He applied to lead the prestigious Paris Op\u00c3\u00a9ra, but some of its star singers said they would never \u00e2\u20ac\u0153submit to the orders of a mulatto\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is a touch of Bridgertonian romantic intrigue to the film, it must be said, but some artistic licence is understandable, if not essential. Documentation of Bologne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life is far from complete. In fact, it was actively suppressed: in 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte banned performances of his compositions, and his name was all but erased from musical history until recently. It is a similar story with many other Black European histories: they were either lost, forgotten or never considered worthy of record. When Gerzina was researching her book 26 years ago, she asked an assistant at a prominent London bookshop if they had Peter Fryer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Staying Power, a seminal history of Black people in Britain. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She just looked at me and said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcMadam, there were no Black people in England before 1945.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The picture is being filled in, though. Researchers are uncovering ever more about Black British lives, many of which would be worthy of a movie. Nathaniel Wells, for example: born in Saint Kitts to a white father and a Black mother, he inherited his father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Welsh estate in 1794 and became a magistrate, even as he continued to run slave plantations in the Caribbean. Rhimes herself has evoked this forgotten history in reference to Bridgerton: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There were so many successful Black composers; lots of rich African people sent their children to England for boarding school,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said in a recent interview. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Those things existed, and I was amazed to find they did. What I wanted to explore was, what happens if you unerase that erased history?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Erasing history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has become a contentious phrase in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture wars. Attempts to bring Black history to light are still being resisted and suppressed. The BBC was recently accused of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rewriting British history to promote a woke agenda\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for example, for making content about histories of enslavement. But when people campaigned against statues associated with Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slave trade, such as that of Edward Colston, which was ceremoniously chucked into Bristol harbour in 2020, critics including Boris Johnson argued that this was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153erasing history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Similar arguments took place over the removal of Confederate statues in the US, even as the American right has been enacting draconian book-banning and syllabus-shaping legislation to inhibit wider knowledge of Black (and brown and queer) histories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c erasing history. But overwriting the actual history with more fanciful versions could also be seen as a form of erasure. At a time when forces are invested in suppressing Black history, shows such as Queen Charlotte could be playing into their hands. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re primarily a visual culture nowadays,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Martin, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in terms of information and the stories we tell about ourselves and each other, the phenomenon of Bridgerton means that the template has been set in terms of what the public expects and demands. So a lot of fantastic, ordinary, everyday heroic people will find their stories pushed into the background \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in favour of glamour and beautifully dressed lords and ladies.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chevalier is in UK cinemas now. This article was amended on 12 June 2023 to correct a reference to the abolition of slavery. It was the slave trade that was abolished in the British empire in 1807."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/12/tony-awards-2023-leopoldstadt-and-kimberly-akimbo-win-big-in-historic-night-for-non-binary-actors", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Tony awards 2023: Leopoldstadt and Kimberly Akimbo win big in historic night for non-binary actors", "lead": "Jodie Comer and Tom Stoppard led a big night for Brits, while J Harrison Ghee and Alex Newell triumphed in a ceremony affected by the writers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 strike", "author": "Benjamin Lee", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T04:18:45Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764311", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f2dbcfa4325d01199c2063308facf8d00511cb31/952_0_2428_1458/500.jpg", "body": "Leopoldstadt and Kimberly Akimbo won big at this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history-making Tony awards, with the writers strike affecting the format and content of the ceremony. Tom Stoppard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sprawling family drama Leopoldstadt was named best play, winning against Cost of Living and Fat Ham. Producer Sonia Friedman called it Stoppard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153most personal masterwork\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and Stoppard said that throughout his career he has noticed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the theatre writer getting decreasingly devalued in the food chain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, Patrick Marber, also won. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel a little self-conscious up here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the writer-director said, going on to call Stoppard his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beloved friend and still my hero\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Brandon Uranowitz was named best featured actor in a play for his role. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My impostor syndrome is on fire,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, thanking Stoppard for a play that tackled anti-Semitism, among other key issues. Leopoldstadt won two Olivier awards when it originally premiered in the West End. History was made with two actors becoming the first ever non-binary winners of acting Tonys. J Harrison Ghee was named best actor in a leading role in a musical for Some Like It Hot, paying tribute to their mother for telling them to use their talent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to be effective in the world, to help someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s journey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Alex Newell won best featured actor in a musical for their role in Shucked. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have wanted this my entire life,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they said, before adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I should not be up here, as a queer non-binary fat Black little baby from Massachusetts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jodie Comer followed her Olivier award win, by picking up the Tony for best actress in a leading role in a play for one-woman show Prima Facie. She plays a barrister dealing with sexual assault, a character she referred to as her \u00e2\u20ac\u0153greatest teacher\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in an emotive speech. She also spoke \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to every person who feels represented by Tessa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Comer won in a competitive category that included Jessica Chastain and Audra McDonald. Earlier this week, Comer stopped a performance of the show as a result of New York City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unhealthy air crisis. The actor said she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t breathe, and was replaced by her understudy. This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ceremony was almost cancelled as a result of the writers strike, but an agreement on 15 May meant that the night would not be picketed as long as it was unscripted. Reports suggested that a script had already been written before the strike began, but after host Ariana DeBose opened the event with a wordless musical number, she explained that there wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a script for the night. Tele-prompters would only show a countdown for speeches that were overrunning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for Broadway to speak for herself,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DeBose said, keying up one of the night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s many musical performances. Later she made reference to her controversial Bafta rap by saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Alex and J did the thing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, paying tribute to the two non-binary winners. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Writers Guild of America still asked nominated members not to attend. Lin-Manuel Miranda had been recruited to write a song for the evening but stopped writing as a result of the strike. Kimberly Akimbo, about a teenage girl with a condition that causes her to age rapidly, was named best musical, with its star Victoria Clark named best lead actress. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are nothing without our writers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Clark said, in reference to the strike. Pulitzer prize-winning playwright David Lindsay-Abaire won for best book of a musical. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tomorrow we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to be on the picket lines,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in his speech, adding, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we just want to be treated fairly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Bonnie Milligan was also named best featured actress in a musical for the show. Suzan-Lori Parks won best revival of a play for her Pulitzer prize-winning drama Topdog/Underdog. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Look at what the spirit can do,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said in her speech. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This means a whole lot to a whole lot of people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She went on to call theatre \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the great cure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The play originated in 2001 and was nominated for best play in 2002. Sean Hayes was named best actor in a leading role for a play for Good Night, Oscar, winning in a tough category against Corey Hawkins and Wendell Pierce. Parade, which tells the true story of the lynching of a falsely accused Jewish man in 1913, won for best revival of a musical. In 1998, Parade picked up two Tony awards for its first Broadway run. Michael Arden also won for best direction of a musical for Parade. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We must come together, we must battle this; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so, so important, or we are doomed to repeat the horrors of our history,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, of the play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s continued relevance among ongoing bigotries. He recalled being targeted as a gay youth before calling himself \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a faggot with a Tony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, a moment that was bleeped out by CBS.

But in just six years, she created a national treasure, and became an icon of folk art in southern Ukraine. That house, decorated with images inspired by the rich natural life of the floodplains that backed on to Rayko\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s garden, is the latest casualty of the Kakhovka dam collapse. Rayko spent her life in Oleshky village, in southern Kherson, among those worst affected by the flood unleashed last week. It is under Russian occupation, so no one has been able to go and assess the state of the house she turned into a masterpiece, but even the limited news that has filtered out is devastating. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The last thing we know is that the neighbours said the first floor of their house was flooded, which means that Rayko\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s will be submerged up to the roof,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Simon Khramtsov, an artist and designer from Kherson, who works with the foundation that preserved Rayko\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If something survives, it will be fragmentary.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The waters could go down, or if more of the dam collapses, rise further, the house could even be washed away entirely. But its traditional structure means even a few days underwater is likely to have caused extensive, irreparable damage. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most likely, we will lose it, because the house was made of a samanna [an unburned mixture of clay, straw, and sand] covered with silicate bricks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Oksana Semenik, an art historian and journalist who runs the Ukrainian Art History account on Twitter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Her main and the only artwork was this house. We have lost her heritage and her physical presence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rayko was part of an important tradition of naive or folk art in Ukraine that inspired more formally taught contemporaries. Perhaps the most famous of Polina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessors in this tradition, painter Maria Prymachenko, has also been a target in this war. An attack on her native Ivankiv set a museum housing many of her works on fire, some were lost, and locals risked their lives to save 25. The invasion launched by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, does not simply aim to annex Ukrainian territory; it means to erase Ukrainian culture, history and heritage. Monuments and art treasures have been frequent targets. The destruction of Rayko\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s masterpiece comes on top of another, human loss. Ukrainian artist Viacheslav Mashnytskyi, one of the first to discover Rayko, and her great champion in the region has been missing since last year. When Russian troops were driven out of the region last autumn, friends found bloodstains at his house, his furniture overturned, but no trace of the artist himself. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153His fate is still unknown. He was an important figure in Ukrainian art and especially for Kherson,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Semenik said. Rayko started painting as a way to process her grief after enduring a wave of tragedies, including the loss of her husband and the death of her only daughter in a car crash. Her son became an addict, was abusive to her and was eventually arrested. She had no training, and no special equipment, starting out with paint and brushes from a local hardware shop. She only painted for six years. But her legacy spread across the region, from the frescos in a Kherson supermarket inspired by her work, to the pilgrimages young artists made from Kyiv and other cities to visit her home. For Ukrainian chef Olia Hercules, who is also from Kherson region, Rayko\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s art offered a path through her own trauma in the wake of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full-scale invasion of her homeland. She was captivated by a documentary on the artist, and her description of the liberation she found in painting, the sensation it gave her of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153soaring in the sky, like I was flying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was inspired by her story, what happened to her, how she dealt with it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Hercules. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is an amazing way to process grief, so I started painting my kitchen door, its nothing perfect, nothing too artistically perfect but it really helped me.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At that time I was listening to the very heavy news from Kherson, but painting made it easier to stay informed and have this process. It helped me a lot with my psychological state.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In a post sharing images of Rayko\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s art on Instagram, Hercules wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I cannot stop crying. I grieve today and everyday for every human, animal, bird, plant, insect, and also art that is being destroyed in my home region. An irreversible, painful loss for us all. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Please remember her and her beautiful house full of unique art, now under the murky water of the catastrophic flood.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/kim-jong-un-holds-hands-with-vladimir-putin-as-russia-north-korea-ties-deepen", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Kim Jong-un \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcholds hands\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with Vladimir Putin as Russia-North Korea ties deepen", "lead": "In a message to mark Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national day, Kim pledged his regime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfull support\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to Moscow", "author": "Justin McCurry in Tokyo", "datePublished": "2023-06-12T03:33:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764315", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a2df2c54f4bc00ff1512bbff1a0d2ea7f68e285e/0_221_4052_2433/500.jpg", "body": "Kim Jong-un has vowed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hold hands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with Vladimir Putin in a message that marked another sign of deepening ties between North Korea and Russia. In a message to Putin to mark Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national day on Monday, the North Korean ruler pledged his regime\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full support\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for Moscow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion of Ukraine, the official KCNA news agency said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Justice is sure to win, and the Russian people will continue to add glory to the history of victory,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kim said in an English translation of the message. Pyongyang has been accused of providing weapons to Russia, while it continues to develop its own arsenal of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons despite years of sanctions imposed by the UN security council, of which Russia is a permanent member. Russia appears to have turned to North Korea and other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rogue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd nations in a desperate attempt to skirt sanctions and export controls to secure the weapons it needs to continue its 16-month war against Ukraine. Kim, who met Putin for the first time in 2019, called for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153closer strategic cooperation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between Pyongyang and Moscow, adding that he would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153firmly hold hands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the Russian leader in their common aim to build \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a powerful country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, KCNA said. North Korea has triggered international concern with its conspicuous attempts to move closer to the Kremlin, blaming the US and its allies for the war in Ukraine. In March, the US said Moscow was sending a delegation to North Korea to offer food \u00e2\u20ac\u201c amid reports of food shortages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in exchange for weapons, in violation of security council sanctions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As part of this proposed deal, Russia would receive over two dozen kinds of weapons and munitions from Pyongyang,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd White House national security council spokesperson John Kirby said at the time. Putin has responded to Kim\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overtures by in turn calling for closer ties. In an exchange of letters last August to mark liberation day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when the Koreas were liberated from Japanese colonial rule in 1945 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Putin said Russia and North Korea would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continue to expand the comprehensive and constructive bilateral relations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to strengthen the security and stability of the Korean peninsula and north-east Asia. In July 2022, North Korea recognised two Russian-backed breakaway \u00e2\u20ac\u0153people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s republics\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in eastern Ukraine as independent states, with officials raising the prospect of North Korean workers being sent to there to help in construction and other sectors.

More than 20 others have been taken to hospital with various injuries after the bus overturned late on Sunday night. The 58-year-old driver has been arrested and charges are pending, while a crime scene has been declared at the site of the crash. The acting police commissioner, Tracy Chapman, said it was possible there were people still trapped at the scene and that it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a confronting and very traumatic scene\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for first responders. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are 10 people confirmed deceased and a further 25 people have been transported to hospital and at this stage, they have varying injuries,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said.

Chapman said as far as police knew, no children were involved. Police were called to Wine Country Drive near Greta just after 11.30pm in response to reports that a coach had rolled. Guests had been at the Wandin Estate winery in Lovedale before the crash. The winery posted on Instagram that they were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deeply saddened\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to hear of the fatal crash, and that they were supporting guests who needed their help. The Hunter Valley is a wine region located approximately 250km north of Sydney, and is a popular holiday and wedding destination. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a nice day, pretty good wedding, fairytale stuff, then \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we got the news there had been a crash and we all started panicking,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a man who said he had been at the wedding told the Seven Network. Emergency services were still on the scene early on Monday. The driver of the bus was taken to hospital for mandatory testing and assessment before his arrest, police said. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said some local residents were on the bus, as he thanked first responders and sent his wishes for a recovery to the injured. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All of us know the joy of going to a wedding, a chance to celebrate dear friends and family. They are some of the happiest times that you can have,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For a joyous day like that, in a beautiful place, to end with such terrible loss of life and injury is so cruel and so sad and so unfair. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All Australians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 thoughts go out to the family, friends, and loved ones of those we lost in such horrific circumstances.

The arts were also strongly represented this year, with 55 awards overall, including an AO for writer Tim Winton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service to literature, conservation and the environment. Comedians Ben Elton, Judith Lucy and Denise Scott received AMs. Other notable mentions were the CEO of the Australian Council of Social Service (Acoss), Dr Cassandra Goldie, who received an AO for service to social justice, the former sex discrimination commissioner Kate Jenkins and the former politician and journalist Maxine McKew. The youngest recipient was 30 years old while the eldest living recipient was 97. Overall, 1,191 Australians received honours and awards, including 19 military service awards, 199 meritorious awards and 54 distinguished and conspicuous awards on top of 919 in the general division. This list also included 73 Australians recognised for their contribution during the pandemic, who will be enshrined in a separate ongoing Covid-19 honour roll. Among them were professors Jane Gunn, Michael Richard Kidd and Sharon Liberali, who were all made officers, while members of the police, ambulance, emergency services and corrections were also on the honour roll. Hurley congratulated the recipients on behalf of Australia, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d made him \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enormously optimistic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the future of the nation.

But after several months in which tensions between the two countries have only increased, both sides will need to overcome a mutual mistrust that has been allowed to build following a number of recent incidents. Biden made his comments predicting a thaw at the G7 summit in Japan in May, just as the group of countries published a strongly worded statement rebuking China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour on a range of issues, including regional security and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153economic coercion\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The show of unity from the allied economies, with the US at the helm, made any unfreezing of US-China relations seem like a distant prospect. But in recent weeks there have been gradual signs of increased dialogue between the two superpowers. Last week, two mid-level US officials met with Chinese counterparts in Beijing. Daniel Kritenbrink, the assistant US secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific Affairs, and Sarah Beran, the national security council senior director for China, travelled to Beijing to meet Ma Zhaoxu, the deputy foreign minister, and Yang Tao, the director of the North American and oceanian affairs department. In May, William Burns, the director of the CIA, was reported to have travelled to Beijing for a series of secret meetings with intelligence officials, while the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top diplomat, Wang Yi, in Vienna. These attempts have all been part of an effort to rebuild relations since the spy ballon saga earlier this year led to Blinken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original visit to Beijing, which had been scheduled for February, being cancelled. In February, US fighter jets shot down a large Chinese balloon off the coast of South Carolina. The Biden administration concluded that it was a surveillance airship that had flown over sensitive military sites. China admitted owning the balloon but said it was a civilian vessel used for meteorological research. The incident sparked a global row about the use of Chinese spy balloons in several countries and it severely damaged the goodwill that had been established when Biden met President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Indonesia in November. Recent trust-building exercises also suffered a new blow after the Wall Street Journal reported last week that China and Cuba had reached a multibillion-dollar agreement for China to build an eavesdropping facility on the island. The US, China and Cuba all denied the reports. Many analysts noted that the timing of the report coincided with Blinken\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second attempt to visit Beijing, raising questions about whether it had been leaked to derail the trip. Trade friction Part of the difficulty is that both the US and China claim to want dialogue while taking tangible actions to decouple their economies. China has emerged from three years of zero-Covid policies with claims that it is open for business again, while also engaging in raids on foreign companies. The US says it is not trying to contain Chinese growth, but has placed sanctions on key industries, such as semiconductors. Beijing recently instructed Chinese companies that operate in critical industries not to purchase chips from Micron, a US company, which seemed to be a retaliatory move after the Biden administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s export controls on advanced chipmaking technology. The US has also persuaded Japan and the Netherlands to block the sale of chip equipment, a move that is aimed at curbing China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military and technological development. Wang Huiyao, the president of the Centre for China and Globalisation, a thinktank in Beijing, said China objected to the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double standards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Taiwan tensions The US claims to support the One China policy and says it does not want to stop China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but what they have done is very different\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Wang said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That has really upset the mood for negotiations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The One China policy outlines the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s acceptance of the government in Beijing as the sole ruler of China. Beijing claims that Taiwan is part of that territory. In recent weeks the US military has accused Chinese forces of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsafe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unnecessarily aggressive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd manoeuvres in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, two areas where the US is especially concerned about China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s increasing presence. On Thursday Taiwan reported that 37 Chinese military aircraft flew into the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s air defence zone. Areas of cooperation The Blinken visit will be a belated follow-up to the Xi-Biden meeting. In November the two presidents discussed cooperation on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153transnational challenges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, such as climate change and health security. But even those goals have been frustrated in recent months. Last week the US ambassador, Nicholas Burns, said China wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t doing enough to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US, emphasising that combatting the supply of the drug was high on the agenda in discussions with Beijing. The next day Chinese state broadcaster CGTN released a documentary about the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opioids crisis which accused the US of pointing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the finger of blame at China\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a self-inflicted problem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no non-political spheres in the US-China space,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Isaac Stone Fish, the founder of Strategy Risks, a China-focused data company. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like it or not, Beijing insists that politics infuses and dominates all of these areas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

But not all cases of wrongful conviction end this way. It took a sustained push from Folbigg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s friends and years of pro bono legal work. Experts say the case shows there is a need for an independent body to investigate possible miscarriages of justice in Australia to avoid a repeat of Folbigg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nightmare. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a rare case,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Michael Kirby, a former high court justice. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We seem to be having lots of these cases of unjust convictions coming forward.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Folbigg, 55, was pardoned last week by the New South Wales attorney general after spending 20 years in prison over the deaths of her four children. Her advocates have said she suffered one of the gravest miscarriages of justice in Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. She was convicted in 2003 of the murders of three of her children and the manslaughter of one child but always maintained her innocence. An inquiry led by the former state chief justice Tom Bathurst found there was reasonable doubt as to Folbigg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guilt for each of the deaths after new scientific evidence found three of the children could have died of natural causes. The findings of the inquiry prompted the attorney general, Michael Daley, to recommend that Folbigg be unconditionally pardoned and released immediately. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Kirby said cases such as Folbigg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s required \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very careful contemplation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and should not always be pushed through the usual criminal courts and appeals system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Very intelligent people looked closely at the Folbigg case, and on the basis of the evidence that was before the jury they came to the conclusion there had not been a miscarriage of justice,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Kirby is among academics and experts calling for the introduction of a body to review such cases, known in other countries as a criminal cases review commission. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s preferable to have matters of this kind determined by an independent reviewer. It is a failsafe.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While these commissions take different forms in different jurisdictions, the rough outline remains the same: an independent panel of experts review convictions and comb through old or fresh evidence. Kirby pointed to similar systems established in comparable countries, including the UK, the US, New Zealand and Canada. The UK Criminal Cases Review Commission, established in 1997, had already reviewed 27,514 cases, with 776 sent back to courts and 535 appeals allowed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What is so superior about the Australian criminal justice system that we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kirby asked. He is not alone. The Australian Law Council and the Sydney Institute of Criminology are also calling for the establishment of a review body, while a host of experts have voiced their support. Daley said the circumstances of Folbigg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rare and exceptional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and reflected the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153changing nature of scientific knowledge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He said he had requested advice from the Department of Communities and Justice on the system of post-appeal conviction reviews. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I will consider this advice carefully, along with the report of the inquiry into Ms Folbigg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convictions when that report is finalised.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The current system makes it extremely difficult for anyone to have their convictions overturned once they have exhausted their appeal pathways. It relies on a prisoner having the network and patience to mount public campaigns to persuade the government to call an inquiry or allow an exceptional appeal. A review body would have the power and resources to dive into claims of injustice and refer them back to the court of criminal appeal if they had any standing. Prof Gary Edmond from the University of New South Wales said a review commission would enable the legal system to understand and address some of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153blindspots\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we take innocence seriously in our system, we would have such a commission,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would enable us to get a sense of some of the kinds of blind spots and limitations and consider the systemic problems with the performance of our trial and appellate processes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because our system is so case based, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard for it to kind of learn. And I think cases like Folbigg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reinforce that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While Edmond said the treatment of forensic sciences in courts had historically been a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mixed bag\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, he added that admissibility requirements for expert evidence as well as varying levels of resources available to defendants meant there were still gaps in the system. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If the parties aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t well enough resourced or aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sophisticated enough to actually appreciate problems and issues that need to be raised, then courts are never going to be presented with them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a lot of assumptions that are untested. And if you kind of poke them, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t necessarily hold water.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/11/tony-awards-2023-full-list-of-winners", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Tony awards 2023: full list of winners", "lead": "This year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s big winners including Jodie Comer, Suzan Lori-Parks and J Harrison Ghee", "author": "Benjamin Lee", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T23:59:46Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764331", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/cfabca8f6965a95a710ae76ee7836cb98fc790b9/0_85_2573_1545/500.jpg", "body": "Best musical &amp; Juliet Kimberly Akimbo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c WINNER!

Stability wins in this circumstance every time.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the reality. Last night, Voss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Carlton had eleven players who were top 20 selections in their draft. That included two No 1 picks, a No 3, a pair of Coleman medallists and a Brownlow medallist. They kicked six goals. They lost their eighth game in nine weeks. Their key forwards can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t kick straight. Their midfielders can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hit the broad side of a barn. They let Essendon, hardly an offensive juggernaut, slam on six goals in 15 minutes. They laid 37 tackles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c their lowest tally in eight years. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move the ball. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t score. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re no good. For Blues fans, watching their team is excruciating. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re kicking 15 goals and getting pipped at the post. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re North Melbourne, with a glut of young players who are going to be stars. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as though they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re Hawthorn, with a clear plan and purpose. Last week, Voss said they were playing too tight. But the whole place is on edge. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this all-pervasive anxiety \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from the board members lashing out in the rooms, to the full forward ballooning set shots from 10 metres out and the crazed lunatics jamming talkback lines. The fans have heard it all before. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been given a lot of assurances. Their team has had all the picks, and all the favours. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ridden the cycle of hope, hype and letdown. They keep being told to be patient. It will come. Stay the course. Back the coach in. But there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very real chance that this list \u00e2\u20ac\u201c built brick by brick and high draft pick by high draft pick since Brendan Bolton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first crop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c may be a bust. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very real chance that Patrick Cripps, who has carried more load than perhaps any other footballer of his generation, who is clearly banged up, and who is now being unfairly blamed for their recent form, may end up never playing in a final. If that happens, it will be a travesty. In terms of Voss, comparisons have been made to Geelong in 2006, and the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to stick with Mark Thompson. But that Cats side had played in a preliminary final in 2004. The following year, they lost a first semi-final to the eventual premiers, and only by a freak event. Others are comparing it to Richmond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to back in Damien Hardwick in 2016. But Hardwick had taken his team to three finals series in a row. The coach aside, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of Richmond from 10 years ago about Carlton now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the forever thwarted hopes, the frustration, the way that you can see exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being built, but feel like it could collapse at any point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not Vossy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was a common sentiment on social media last night. And clearly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all on him. There are systemic issues around list and salary cap management. He was desperately unlucky with injuries last year. But he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now coached 35 games at Carlton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a season and a half. Of those, what have been his standout wins? Was it his first win, over a Richmond side that had finished 12th six months earlier? Maybe it was the win over the in-form Fremantle a tick under a year ago? Maybe it was the win over Geelong earlier this year? The Blues just fell over the line that night and the Cats played as poorly as they have in years. Was that the apex of the Voss era? The past is always present at Carlton. Last night, their 16 premiership cups sat alongside Essendon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 16 to form a perfect circle jerk in the middle of the MCG. It was a reminder of a different Carlton, an imperial Carlton, a Carlton that would have shown Voss the door weeks ago. But the new Carlton is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153values-led\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are humble, yet ambitious and inwardly confident,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd its latest five-year plan reads. Voss is contracted for three years. In many ways, being patient, being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inwardly confident\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and sticking the course would be the easy option. The brutal decision, the old school Carlton decision, and maybe the right decision, would be to admit this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, and that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the man for the job. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard. He was a magnificent footballer. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s universally admired. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s given it everything. But it hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worked. Every week, we see it. Every week, it seems to get worse. Nothing works, nothing changes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is this the real life, is this just fantasy?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the club tweeted after his first win last year. Maybe it was a fantasy all along. Maybe the 8-2 sugar hit and Cripps\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Brownlow year papered over the reality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that the team is patently ordinary, that the coach has no tricks and no discernible gameplan and that the club, for the umpteenth time this century, is going to have to start again."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/12/uk-business-leader-diversity-has-not-increased-since-george-floyd-death", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "UK business leader diversity has not increased since George Floyd death", "lead": "Nearly 70% of office workers say their firms have not increased number of black, Asian or ethnic minority leaders", "author": "Mark Sweney", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T23:01:04Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764335", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c8038ab95202d597a759eca0010b20a3434debd5/1264_525_3889_2334/500.jpg", "body": "The number of senior business leaders from ethnically diverse backgrounds has not significantly increased since the death of George Floyd sparked global protests and $50bn (\u00c2\u00a340bn) of corporate pledges to address racial inequality in the workplace.

The moves came after a review of the stadium involving people affected by dementia who provided feedback on their match-day experiences. But the national stadium has not yet gone as far pioneering dementia-friendly changes made at Swansea City. Its stadium provides ear defenders for those with dementia who become overwhelmed by noise. It also has an inclusion room to provide a quiet space for watching games, and the first and last steps on stairs in the stands are painted red to help those with perception problems. Liam Boylan, director of Wembley Stadium, said the changes were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the first steps in ensuring that those affected by dementia are not excluded from the beautiful game\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The changes at Swansea and Wembley are part of a Football Association-backed initiative by the Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Society to try to ensure all football grounds are welcoming to people with dementia. The charity says 900,000 people in the UK are living with dementia, a figure that is predicted to reach 1 million by 2025. It points out that those with dementia often find match days too disorienting and overwhelming, because of noise levels, the size of venues and their inability to effectively communicate. The Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Society has produced a guide for dementia-friendly sports clubs and venues that it wants to see widely adopted. The charity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Kate Lee, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We want to see all sports showing their commitment to giving fans with dementia a smooth journey from sofa to stands.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said she hoped the guidance \u00e2\u20ac\u0153helps foster a more inclusive, accessible and welcoming environment for sport fans with dementia, so they can continue to be at the heart of the action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Catherine Thomas, Swansea City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head of hospitality, events and fan engagement, said the club had set up a working group of fans affected by dementia who informed the changes it has made.

At a time of both deteriorating international relations and the escalation of nuclear sabre-rattling, there are now said to be an estimated 12,512 warheads globally, of which 9,576 are in military stockpiles ready for potential use, up 86 on a year ago. The rise brings to an end the period of gradual decline that followed the end of the cold war. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) suggested 60 of the new warheads were held by China. The other new weapons are attributed to Russia (12), Pakistan (five), North Korea (five) and India (four). The increase in battle-fit warheads comes despite a statement in 2021 from the UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s five permanent security council members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the US, Russia, China, the UK and France \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Russia and the US together possess almost 90% of all the nuclear weapons globally. In addition to their usable nuclear weapons, the two powers each hold more than 1,000 warheads previously retired from military service, which they are gradually dismantling. Of the total of 12,512 warheads in the world, which includes those that are retired and awaiting dismantlement, Sipri estimates that 3,844 are deployed with missiles and aircraft. Around 2,000 of those \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nearly all of which belong to Russia or the US \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are kept in a state of high operational alert, meaning that they are fitted to missiles or held at airbases hosting nuclear bombers. Sipri notes, however, that the full picture is difficult to judge as a number of countries, including Russia, the US and the UK, have reduced their level of transparency since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine. China, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s third biggest nuclear power, is believed to have increased its number of warheads from 350 in January 2022 to 410 in January 2023. That arsenal is expected to keep growing but Sipri predicts it they will not surpass the arsenals of the US and Russia. The report adds that China has never declared the size of its nuclear arsenal and that many of its assessments rely on data from the US Department of Defense (DOD). In 2021, commercial satellite imagery revealed that China had started construction of hundreds of new missile silos across the north of its territory. Hans M Kristensen, an associate senior fellow with Sipri\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weapons of mass destruction programme, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153China has started a significant expansion of its nuclear arsenal. It is increasingly difficult to square this trend with China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s declared aim of having only the minimum nuclear forces needed to maintain its national security.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd France (290) and the UK (225) are the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next largest nuclear powers and British operational arsenal is expected to grow further following an announcement two years ago that it was raising its limit from 225 to 260 warheads. Of the 225 UK warheads, 120 of are said to be operationally available for delivery by Trident II D5 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), with about 40 being carried on a nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) that is on patrol at all times. The UK government has said, however, that it will no longer publicly disclose its quantities of nuclear weapons, deployed warheads or deployed missiles amid increased global tensions. The new British policy is just one sign of a breakdown in cooperation over the future of nuclear weapons. The US suspended its bilateral strategic stability dialogue with Russia following the invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin announced it was suspending its participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty limiting the strategic nuclear forces of the two cold war foes. Meanwhile, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government has increasingly spoken of the risk of nuclear war since its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Putin has said that he has put Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear deterrent on high alert. He also said in the immediate wake of his invasion that the consequences for those who stood in his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s way would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153such as you have never seen in your entire history\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Since then, Nato\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arming of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s military has provoked a constant stream of nuclear threats from figures close to the Kremlin. Dan Smith, a director at Sipri, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are drifting into one of the most dangerous periods in human history. It is imperative that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governments find ways to cooperate in order to calm geopolitical tensions, slow arms races and deal with the worsening consequences of environmental breakdown and rising world hunger.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jun/12/ofsted-school-inspection-ruth-perry-sister", "primaryCategory": "education", "title": "Ofsted school inspection reforms \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnowhere near enough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122", "lead": "Sister of Ruth Perry, who killed herself after her primary was downgraded, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdisappointed\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 single-word judgments not removed", "author": "Richard Adams Education editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T23:01:04Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764340", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/11b4aeaa1c0a686cc074d7f69e524a13ccc2253c/0_106_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "Changes by Ofsted to the way it inspects schools have been criticised as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nowhere near enough\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to reduce the resulting high levels of stress involved, which were linked to the recent death of a popular headteacher. The reforms announced by Amanda Spielman, Ofsted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief inspector, are intended to ease the burden felt by school leaders such as Ruth Perry, 53, the head of a primary in Reading who killed herself earlier this year after an Ofsted inspection lowered her school\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grade from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153outstanding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inadequate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Despite the national outcry over Perry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, Spielman and the Department for Education (DfE) have refused to budge on the most contentious issue: the labelling by Ofsted of schools in England with a single overall grade, such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inadequate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Perry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family and teaching leaders said Ofsted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals fell well short of the overhaul needed to make school inspections fairer and less devastating for the school leaders involved. Prof Julia Waters, Perry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am disappointed that no mention is made about removing harmful and misleading single-word judgments. I can understand the need to provide clarity and simplicity for parents about an inspection but too much is hidden or lost behind a headline judgment of just one or two words.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Waters added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ruth was not the first headteacher or teacher to take her own life following an Ofsted inspection. I am determined that she should be the last.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The biggest change announced by Spielman would allow schools rated inadequate solely because of errors in safeguarding procedures to be re-inspected by Ofsted within three months, giving school leaders an opportunity to quickly fix concerns. Such a policy may have benefited Perry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s school, which would have been rated as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but for the procedural errors. The changes would accelerate Ofsted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complaints procedures, allowing schools to appeal to its independent ombudsman more quickly. Ofsted would also offer more support to school leaders during the inspection process, with heads able to externally consult a senior inspector for advice. Schools will also be given a broad timeframe for their next inspection of between a term to a year, but will still only receive one day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notice of the exact date. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has taken far too long for the government and Ofsted to announce this relatively modest set of measures, and school leaders remain immensely frustrated at the lack of urgency and ambition being shown. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153While the government insists on consigning schools to simplistic single-word judgments, the system will remain fundamentally flawed and put unnecessary pressure on school leaders.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Spielman said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Since the sad death of Ruth Perry, there has been considerable debate around Ofsted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work and I want to reassure people that we are listening to their concerns, and thinking carefully about how we can revise aspects of our work without losing our clear focus on the needs of children and their parents. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have listened to many voices in this debate. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m particularly grateful to union leaders, other sector representatives and the secretary of state for the constructive discussions we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had over the last couple of months, which have helped us with this package of measures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gillian Keegan, the education secretary, endorsed the changes, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have committed to continuing our work on improving the way we inspect our schools with Ofsted and the family of Ruth Perry following her tragic death.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Last week Keegan met with Perry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family and friends, and discussed the changes being proposed. Waters said she had been encouraged by the discussions with Keegan after the death of her sister but that much more still needed to be done. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I welcome any changes that ease some of the burden on headteachers undergoing what can feel like inescapable, ritual humiliation. But these changes do not yet go far enough,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Parents, pupils and teachers deserve an inspection regime that they can trust and which supports schools to do the best for every child. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcTrial by Ofsted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 must end. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having listened to the outpouring of anger, distress and outrage towards Ofsted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current inspection regime in the past couple of months, since we first spoke out about what happened to Ruth, I do not believe these proposals adequately address the many problems that the system creates.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Waters did praise Ofsted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposal allowing headteachers to share provisional inspection results with staff and governors before a final report was published, which she said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153could certainly have helped to alleviate the terrible burden that Ruth was forced to bear alone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for 54 days, unable to discuss it with others. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, of which Perry was a member, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more extensive and fundamental changes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were needed to limit Ofsted\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s damage to teachers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wellbeing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need a reliable system, built on fairness and support, not surveillance and jumping through hoops,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Bousted said. * In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

A new report by the accountancy firm KPMG has found that the economy has enjoyed a better start to the year than it had thought, and is now expected to grow by 0.3% this year, compared with its previous prediction of an uplift of just 0.1%. However, British households and businesses are set to suffer more financial pain with the Bank of England expected to raise the base interest rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c currently 4.5% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c three more times this year in order to tame the stubbornly high rate of inflation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a slightly stronger momentum for the UK economy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The UK economy has so far avoided a technical recession. But risks are still elevated. A stickier inflation will see monetary policy tightening even further, increasing the risk of unwelcome side effects, among other potential headwinds.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd KPMG said that, while inflation eased to 8.7% in April \u00e2\u20ac\u201c down from 10.1% in March and a peak of 11.1% last October \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was not falling as fast as had been hoped. The firm expects the Bank to continue its run of 12 consecutive increases in the base rate of interest, hitting a peak of 5.25% later this year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Inflation is on the way down, but the pace of moderation is slower than we previously thought,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said KPMG. It added that this would probably require further interest rate increases and bring more pain for borrowers. KPMG said that there was some positive momentum, including Ofgem lowering the energy price cap to \u00c2\u00a32,074 a year for a typical household as wholesale gas prices fell, and the services industry receiving a post-pandemic boost due to pent-up demand stemming from several years of Covid-19 restrictions. The accountancy firm has pencilled in 1.1% growth for 2024, with inflation expected to fall back to 2.9% and the base interest rate forecast to settle at 5%. Another accounting firm, BDO, reported that a 10-month high in output from the services sector delivered a confidence boost for businesses in May while recruitment activity remained resilient. The firm said its monthly \u00e2\u20ac\u0153optimism index\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd grew for the second consecutive month to 99.75, increasing by 1.53 points to its highest reading since August 2022, when concerns of a recession first set in. Separately, the embattled Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has reversed its forecast for this year of a 0.4% decline, and now expects growth of 0.4%. However, the CBI said that the pandemic would leave the UK economy 7% smaller than it would have been had the global health crisis never happened. It said that, among other leading developed nations, only Germany had suffered worse scarring. Germany and Ireland have both fallen into a technical recession this year, which is defined as recording two consecutive quarters of negative growth. While narrowly avoiding a recession, the CBI said 2023 would prove challenging for households and businesses. For the first time since the recession of the early 1980s, it expects real household incomes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a measure of living standards \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to fall for two successive years. The business lobby group last week won support from its remaining members to continue speaking for firms after vowing to reform its culture and governance after allegations of sexual misconduct reported by the Guardian. Its relationship with the government remains on hold. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new director general and previously its chief economist, has made forecasting a key part of her organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy as it battles to survive. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Businesses and consumers alike will be relieved that the UK economy has avoided recession and will re-enter growth territory in the second half of this year,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But firms want to see growth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and productivity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pick up pace.

The report from the home affairs select committee found little evidence to indicate significant numbers of Albanian nationals were at risk in their own country but accepted that some Albanians making asylum claims, mainly women, had been trafficked. It recommends that this group should be returned to Albania only if appropriate safeguards are in place. The committee decided to look at Albanian arrivals to the UK due to the large spike in numbers last year. In 2022, more than a quarter of the 45,755 people who crossed the Channel in small boats came from the country and most claimed asylum. In the space of a year the number of Albanians arriving in the UK by this route had jumped from 800 to 12,301. The reasons for the steep rise are unclear and numbers have dropped significantly in recent months. Critics of small boat arrivals insist Albania is a safe country. The committee agreed and their report points out that the country is not at war and is a candidate to join the EU. There is no clear basis for the UK to routinely accept thousands of asylum applications from Albanian citizens, the report states. Until June 2022, 51% of asylum claims from Albania were initially accepted. Nine countries, including Germany, accepted no asylum claims from Albania. The report urges the Home Office to explain why the asylum grant rates, particularly for women, have been so high. The committee report states that a key driver of migration from Albania to the UK is economic and that improved awareness of work visa programmes would support formalised migration, providing an alternative to people-smuggling gangs. Only 325 work visas were granted to Albanian nationals in the first nine months of 2022. The committee chair, the Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Such a substantial sudden increase in asylum claims from a seemingly peaceful country understandably raised concerns. Changes in migration will inevitably place strain on any system, but the government must do much more to ensure it can better handle these stresses. Most importantly it must improve the speed of decision-making and clear the backlog.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd David Neale, a legal researcher with expertise in Albanian migration who provided evidence to the committee, said the report was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very disappointing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and ignored his evidence that many Albanians were fleeing to escape a cycle of revenge that can pit families against each other over generations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Contrary to the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s assertion, Albania is far from a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsafe country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, as I made clear in my written evidence. One of the major causes of Albanians fleeing Albania is blood feud. Existing country guidance case law makes clear that the Albanian state does not generally provide adequate protection for victims of blood feud, and it is clear in my view that the evidence relied on by the Home Office is insufficient to justify departing from this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd He added that the risk of retrafficking for trafficking victims returned to Albania was significant. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Returning Albanians summarily without substantive consideration of their claims will lead to many genuine refugees being returned to a country where they face further persecution,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Neale. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s priority is stopping the boats. Last year, 28% of those who arrived by small boat to the UK were from Albania \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a safe European country and Nato ally \u00e2\u20ac\u201c placing further strain on our asylum system. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve worked closely with the Albanian government to disrupt criminal gangs and deter illegal migration. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the five months to the end of May, Albanian small boat arrivals are down 90% on last year and we have returned 1,800 illegal migrants and foreign criminals back to Albania. Thanks to changes to our asylum system, we have gone from accepting one in five Albanian asylum claims to just one in 50, in line with other European countries. We will carefully consider the report and respond in due course.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/12/snowy-hydro-looks-to-resume-boring-within-weeks-pending-environmental-approvals", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Snowy Hydro looks to resume boring within weeks pending environmental approvals", "lead": "Proposed changes include a slurry plant to help dig through soft rock, as National Parks Association says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcenormous damage\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 caused already", "author": "Peter Hannam", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T23:00:03Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764391", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/20102b38d7790fe8c9db3a4f2881e919cab1ce74/0_345_5472_3283/500.jpg", "body": "Snowy Hydro hopes it will finally be able to resume boring on the main tunnel of its giant 2.0 pumped hydro project within six weeks after it gets new environment approvals from the New South Wales government. Work on a 17km tunnel that will link a future underground power station to Tantangara dam in the Kosciuszko national park has been stalled since December after a tunnel boring machine \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dubbed Florence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c got stuck in unexpectedly soft rock just 70m in. The chief executive of Snowy Hydro, Dennis Barnes, said it would apply for a modification of the environment approval for the work because the commonwealth-owned firm was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153going for best practice, not just compliance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Snowy would soon submit \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a whole heap of data\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that would go on public exhibition for a few weeks. Work was also proceeding to commission a slurry plant that would enable Florence to tunnel through soft rock, with boring to restart in four to six weeks if approval was given, Barnes said. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We obviously have to wait to see what the modification proposes but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already been enormous damage to the Kosciuszko national park with the works to date,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ted Woodley, a spokesperson for the National Parks Association, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to see any further damage to the park.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Work on the tunnel may then take another three years to complete provided the 211-metre long machine can average 15m a day. Barnes, a former executive at Origin Energy, took over as chief executive in February as Snowy battled mounting costs and delays at the 2.0 project. Announced in 2017 by the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, the plan aimed for 2,000 megawatts of storage capacity by pumping and releasing water between two of Snowy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dams. Initial costs were put at $2bn and have since more than tripled, while the 2025 completion date has been pushed back to the year 2029-30. Barnes will prepare an updated cost estimate for Snowy 2.0 before the end of 2023. Those estimates may include an option to expedite drilling on the head-race tunnel by starting to bore from the other end. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Then the rate of progression of Florence is less important, but obviously there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cost associated with that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Such a change, though, may require new approvals, such as where the spoil from the other end \u00e2\u20ac\u201c drilled from the Marica surge tunnel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would go, Woodley said. He also said the NSW planning department was yet to release its report on the damage caused by the sinkhole that opened up to the surface in front of Florence. That report, which followed other issues with Snowy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s approvals, should identify how Snowy would rectify the impact and ensure there would not be repeats. Separately, Barnes also confirmed that Orica\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s explosive technicians had failed to locate a missing detonator and booster that were unaccounted for two weeks ago. The loss of the items prompted several days of bag searches by staff and an investigation by WorkSafe NSW. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite probable we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never find them and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite possible that they were double-packed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, adding that the area had since been blasted successfully. Inquiries, meanwhile, are continuing into the death of Alan Machon, a contractor who died in April when his truck left the highway between Cooma and another worksite, rolled and caught fire. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Police are still conducting their investigation so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an outcome,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Barnes, who paid tribute to Machon in Snowy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s April update for the project. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have had our own checks of the vehicle and all of our trucking fleet, and had a third party do the mechanical checks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. They have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153all passed the checks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The Thornon family, who have lived in the village for about five years, were enjoying a barbecue in their garden and the girls were playing on swings at about 10pm on Saturday when a man appeared with a gun and fired several shots. Solenne Thornon, 11, was killed immediately while her father, 52-year-old Adrien, was shot in the head. He was taken to hospital where his condition was described as critical. The girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 mother, Rachel, 49, reported to be a local home help, was shot in the back and the head but was reportedly out of danger, the public prosecutor Carine Halley said. The youngest girl, C\u00c3\u00a9leste, aged eight, escaped to a neighbouring property and raised the alarm. Halley said a 71-year-old Dutch man who lived in the same village had been taken into custody in connection with the shootings. His wife was also being questioned. French media reported there had been a conflict between the British family and their neighbours over a plot of land. An investigation for the murder of a minor and attempted murder has been opened.

The shadow health minister, Wes Streeting, said the Tories had avoided selecting Scully \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the only MP on the longlist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s administration was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toxic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to voters.

The hopefuls will take part in hustings from this month before Tory members are asked to vote on their preferred candidate. The winner is expected to be announced on 19 July. The campaign of Korski, a businessman who was a special adviser to David Cameron, has been endorsed by the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove.

Would it have mattered if he had remained stuck on two European titles, his last triumph Barcelona\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sumptuous 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Wembley in 2011? We can tell ourselves that we know what Guardiola is, how he had transformed football and our understanding of what is possible; that we know the magnitude of Arrigo Sacchi, who won two European Cups, and Rinus Michels, who won one, and Valeriy Lobanovskyi, who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t win any; but, still, it feels appropriate to have it confirmed, just as it was fitting to have Lionel Messi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatness confirmed at the World Cup. And this is a tragedy of football\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s modern age: this season has seen the consecration of an all-time great player and an all-time great manager, and yet it will be remembered as the season when sportswashing won. Messi won in Doha, played for a Qatari club and shills for Saudi tourism. Guardiola won in Erdogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Turkey, manages an Emirati club and was an ambassador for Qatar. And that cannot but taint their genius. Three Champions Leagues/European Cups pulls Guardiola level with Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zidane, one behind Carlo Ancelotti. The assumption in 2011 was that he would keep racking up the European titles but, even after his 12-year hiatus, there seems little reason now, so long as he remains at City, why he should not go on to equal and probably surpass Ancelotti. City are a club built in his image with extraordinary resources and a marketing department that has secured a series of incredible sponsorship deals; they are the best side in the world and their pre\u00e2\u20ac\u2018eminence should continue. Comparing that to, for instance, the achievement of Brian Clough at Nottingham Forest, suggests the folly of becoming too obsessed by adding up trophies. Besides, Guardiola deserves more than to be defined by his Champions Leagues alone. He has changed what is considered possible in football. His appointment at Barcelona in 2008 marked the beginning of a new era. Football was in a period of astringency. The dominant managers were Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Mourinho, Marcelo Lippi and Rafa Ben\u00c3\u00adtez. Greece had won the European Championship just four years earlier. The game was ripe for revolution. Improvements in pitch quality, especially, but also in ball and boot technology, meant that a first touch could be taken for granted. The liberalisation of the offside law and the crackdown on the challenge from behind made life easier for technical midfielders: as defensive lines dropped deeper, the playing area in effect increased, and it became harder for opponents physically to intimidate midfield creators. It was Guardiola who recognised the potential of that, who realised that the game could become almost entirely about the manipulation of space. The whole ethos of the game changed. Before 2008, there had been only one season in which the knockout stages in the Champions League yielded an average of more than three goals a game. Since then there has been only one season in which it did not. Nobody has had such a profound impact on how the game is played since Michels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who, of course, via Johan Cruyff, has had a huge influence over Guardiola. But as well as innovation and influence, football is partly about numbers and ticking off the silverware \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least for managers of elite clubs. That Alfred Hitchcock or Stanley Kubrick never won an Oscar, or that Martin Amis or Dame Muriel Spark never won the Booker, is a quirk at the end of their careers; it says more about the politics and subjectivity of such awards than it does about them. Football has a very clear and objective measure of who deserves to win: goals. Style and process are hugely important, and results at times don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t give the full picture, but ultimately the game is about scoring more goals than the opponent, or at least not scoring fewer. And Guardiola, over 10 seasons, kept failing to do that in key European ties. There was some bad luck, there were inexplicable collapses, but most of all there were baffling tactical decisions, most notably the use of Ilkay G\u00c3\u00bcndogan on the left in a 4-4-2 at Liverpool in 2019, the adoption of a back three against Lyon in 2020 and leaving out Fernandinho against Chelsea in 2021. Overthinking became the great Guardiola glitch. When tactical tweaks work, such as restoring John Stones to right\u00e2\u20ac\u2018back on Saturday, of course, they are not overthinking but merely thinking. Had he not won a third Champions League, overthinking might have been his legacy. As it is, it feels as though his career has entered a third phase. There was the young radical, who won two Champions Leagues and changed how the game was played; there was the mature coach with the flaw, the fear of being countered against that paradoxically opened him up to the counter; and now perhaps there is the serial winner, burnishing his already gleaming legacy with further silverware. He has a rare longevity: 14 years between his first and most recent Champions League is a year short of Jupp Heynckes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mark and five short of Ancelotti. That speaks of his capacity to evolve: Guardiolismo is a philosophy in constant flux. This City \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Erling Haaland, Stones pushing into midfield, and often four centre-backs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is just its latest incarnation. Guardiola would have been considered a great even if he had been stuck on two Champions Leagues for ever. If only to head off the most tedious of quibblers, this third comes as welcome confirmation."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/11/trump-indictment-republicans-rhetoric-violence", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Fears that Republicans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rhetoric after Trump indictment could spark violence", "lead": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAn eye for an eye\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, said Arizona congressman, while another representative from Louisiana gave militaristic instructions", "author": "Sam Levine in New York", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T20:00:02Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764406", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b974e2a81b4c14da81d9e36c130d07904d3391c3/0_400_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "Belligerent and conspiracy-laden rhetoric from high-profile Republican backers of Donald Trump has heightened fears that the former US president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign against his legal troubles could trigger political violence.

And the source more pungent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jeffrey Sharlet, a professor at Dartmouth College and author of The Undertow, a book studying the far right. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrhetoric\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is specific: while Twitter giggled at what it took to be the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcword salad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of Higgins\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 statement, those who study militias read it as the call to arms it is.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is language that has been encouraged by Trump himself since before he was elected but that perhaps peaked around the January 6 attack on the US Capitol as his supporters invaded the building to try and prevent the certification of Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s election win. As a candidate in 2016, Trump pledged to cover the legal fees of supporters who assaulted protesters at his rallies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to punch him in the face,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said of one protester at a 2016 rally. On 6 January 2021, Trump used violent language as he encouraged his supporters to descend on the US Capitol to block the certification of the electoral college vote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We fight like hell and if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fight like hell, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to have a country anymore,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. What followed was the deadliest assault on the US capitol in American history with five people dying in connection with the attack. There was evidence that Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s violent language was inspiring his supporters. On The Donald, a pro-Trump forum, users called for violence in order to restore Trump to the presidency, Rolling Stone reported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only way this country ever becomes anything like the Constitution says this country should be is if thousands of traitorous rats are publicly executed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one user wrote, according to the magazine. A 2020 survey by ABC News found at least 54 criminal cases in which Trump was invoked in connection with violent acts or threats of violence. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in the United States is political violence is going from the fringe to the mainstream,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Robert Pape, a professor at the University of Chicago who leads CPOST, told the Guardian earlier this month. Trump allies outside of Washington have also relied on violent language to defend the former president since his most recent indictment for his handling of classified documents after he left the White House. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you want to get to President Trump, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have to go through me, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have to go through 75 million Americans just like me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial candidate, said in a speech on Friday to applause. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to tell you, most of us are card-carrying members of the NRA. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a threat, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a public service announcement.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pete Santilli, a far-right talk show host, called on the military to use zip-ties to detain Biden, put him in the back of a pickup truck and get him out of the White House, according to the New York Times. Another guest on the show said he would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably shoot\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, if it were legal, the Times reported. Santilli also previously called for the execution of former president Barack Obama and other officials if Trump was indicted. Sharlet, the Dartmouth professor, said the violent rhetoric got worse each day that it persisted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every day it corrodes the hope of democracy. Every day it encourages so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclone wolves\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the real militia to whom such not-so-coded signals are broadcast \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to take action,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/11/poor-air-quality-returns-to-us-north-east-canada-wildfires", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Poor air quality returns to US north-east from Canada wildfires", "lead": "New York City, parts of Pennsylvania and Baltimore all issued warnings as 421 wildfires continue to burn up north", "author": "Maya Yang", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T19:25:58Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764437", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c36ace81c2c7799961e855fd1c6df0416b462440/0_446_6778_4067/500.jpg", "body": "Poor air quality returned to the north-east US on Sunday, although it was nowhere near as bad as the heavy haze that recently shrouded the region and triggered global headlines as wind-borne smoke from raging Canadian wildfires caused orange skies, thick smog and record-setting pollutant levels.

According to the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s environment and health data portal, the air quality has largely been improving over time since the thick yellowish haze covered the city last week as a result of smoke from the wildfires which continue to burn in Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forests with little sign of being put out soon. However, hour by hour, there is still large variation in the air quality, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153even in neighborhoods with the cleanest air\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said the portal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That means for short periods, some New Yorkers are exposed to high levels of pollutants,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it added. In Pennsylvania, the state department of environmental protection declared on Sunday an air quality action day and issued a code orange alert. The alert came as a result of elevated ozone levels across three regions of Pennsylvania, including the Philadelphia area, the Lehigh valley, and the central Pennsylvania counties of Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon and York, Penn Live reported. According to the department, young children, the elderly and those with respiratory issues are especially vulnerable to the effects of air pollution and should limit outdoor activities. Ozone forms as a result of airborne chemicals such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide reacting with sunlight. High ozone levels are most common during summer months due to long days of sunshine and high levels of airborne chemicals. The department encouraged residents on Sunday to conserve electricity by setting air conditioning to a higher temperature, combining errands to reduce vehicle trips, limiting engine idling, and refueling cars and trucks after dusk. The Maryland environmental department has also issued a code orange alert for Sunday in the Baltimore region. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153USG [unhealthy for sensitive groups] air quality due to ozone expected around and north-east of Baltimore Sunday as sun and heat returns in the presence of diffuse smoke and a dirtied airmass transported from the south,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the environmental department said.

MPs on the committee are understood to have received threats from members of the public over the weekend, following Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to stand down as an MP after being told they had concluded he deliberately misled parliament over Partygate. Some MPs loyal to the former prime minister who sought to sway the committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision are also said to be at risk of being investigated for a separate contempt of parliament. The seven-strong committee, which has a Tory majority and Labour chair, will regroup at 11am on Monday to finalise the conclusion to their year-long inquiry. They are likely to speed up the the publication of their report, with the details of their findings made public as soon as Wednesday. While Johnson cannot be sanctioned with a suspension now he has resigned, the committee could recommend that he be refused a pass offered to ex-MPs allowing privileged access to parliament. Such a move would be in the power of the Commons speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and it has been recommended before by a parliamentary watchdog. An independent expert panel proposed the sanction for former speaker John Bercow in its report on bullying which was published after he stepped down as an MP. Some of Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies are said to have urged Tory members to write to the privileges committee in a bid to influence its conclusions. The Guardian understands several MPs have held talks on the possibility of tabling a motion with a view to holding them in contempt of parliament. Tim Loughton, a Tory MP and former minister, said Johnson should \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shut up and go away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and branded his allies a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mob\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

He suggested that Johnson was wrong to claim No 10 had promised all the MPs he nominated for peerages would be approved, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Occasionally Boris wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be all over the detail.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shapps said MPs on the privileges committee should be allowed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get on with their job\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and played down Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s potential future in the Conservative party, telling Sky News: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got many other things he wants to get on and do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was knighted in Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation honours, said he was hopeful about the former prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chance of a comeback. He said Sunak should remain leader until the next general election \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but predicted that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153at some indeterminate date in the future when Rishi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hair has gone grey and he decides to retire,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Johnson could come back \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on his charger to save the nation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. While Sunak has made no public appearance since Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation, the prime minister broke his silence on Twitter to tell followers he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153focused on your priorities\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He cited progress on three of his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153five pledges\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.. A flurry of campaigning has already begun for the three byelections triggered by the resignation of Johnson loyalists Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams. Unlike at previous byelections, Labour and the Liberal Democrats appear to have ditched an informal non-aggression pact in Dorries\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 seat. Senior figures from both parties and activists have already flooded the area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c aware of the high prize that taking a constituency with a 24,000 Tory majority would be. Anneliese Dodds, Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, and Shabana Mahmood, the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign coordinator, raced there over the weekend. The Lib Dems, meanwhile, said it had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our best start to a byelection campaign in living memory\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and claimed to have already canvassed more than 10,000 homes with Ed Davey appearing on Sunday and planning a return visit on Monday. Labour came second place in the constituency with 14,000 votes at the last election, to the Lib Dems\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 8,000. A three-way fight could lead the anti-Conservative vote to splinter, making the prospect of a Tory loss less likely. Opposition parties have already been campaigning in earnest in Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat, where the Tories\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 majority is a relatively slim 7,000. They expect to ramp up their presence in Selby and Ainsty, which was vacated by Adams on Saturday. Sunak was urged to call the three byelections swiftly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be sensible for them to take place as quickly as possible,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and elections expert. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be better for the government to deal with this matter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whatever the result \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and then be able to move on and deal with the issues of governance and the autumn party conference.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hayward added No 10 would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153probably hope\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the expected byelection triggered by the 30-day suspension of Margaret Ferrier in Rutherglen and Hamilton West would fall on the same day. An SNP defeat would take some of the political pressure off the Tories, he suggested. Meanwhile, the House of Lords appointment commission sought to distance itself from a row between Johnson and No 10 over the MPs he nominated for a peerage but who were not accepted. In a statement, the commission confirmed that it vetted and did not support eight of the nominees. It added the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153usual processes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was followed and stressed it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not involved in the appointment processes after providing advice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Keen to capitalise on Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s frustration with the government, Nigel Farage suggested he would be open a new form of electoral pact with him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If he wants to defend his Brexit legacy, I want to defend my Brexit legacy too,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Farage told the BBC. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Would there be a possibility of a new coming together on the centre-right? It would be Boris Johnson, there would be other MPs that would join in with this as well.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Farage claimed up to 10 sitting Tories could join and added of Johnson: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have discussed it with people very close to him and around him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/11/elizabeth-a-life-through-the-lens-review-the-late-queens-reign-looks-like-one-long-marketing-campaign", "primaryCategory": "tv-and-radio", "title": "Elizabeth: A Life Through the Lens review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the late queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reign looks like one long marketing campaign", "lead": "This swift documentary looks at the use of photography to shape the previous UK monarch\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s image.

Fearful of the future, the unpopular George VI set in train the phenomenon that would keep his clan in business \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just about \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for another century: a newsreel photographer was hired to shadow the new king and his family, including his daughter and heir, Elizabeth. The royals were to be put on display. So reports Elizabeth: A Life Through the Lens, a slight, swift film that canters through 10 decades in an hour and seems, on the surface, to be a genuflecting biography full of nice photos. But within it is an occasionally fascinating analysis of how and why those pictures were created, illustrating a fundamental truth about the Elizabethan era: it was one long marketing campaign, trying to square the circle of making the British people love their queen without ever getting to know her. The first conscious effort to manage citizens\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 view of Elizabeth came in wartime, when the privations suffered by ordinary folk prompted a move away from the rich prettiness of her earlier photoshoots. Fancy dresses were out. Muted tweeds and sturdy wool were in. Then, in 1947, on her 21st birthday, the princess delivered an address that was mainly heard at the time on radio but is seen here on film. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but I shall not have strength to carry out this resolution alone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The speech, co-written by a Times journalist, was a brilliantly effective piece of propaganda: it reimagined royal life as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153service\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153duty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, creating the illusion not only of heroic sacrifice and hard-working excellence, but of an endeavour shared. Like brand-loyal consumers who feel a sense of investment in a product despite owning no stake in the company, or religious believers who think impure thoughts may be punished, royalist Brits were persuaded that they bore a responsibility to vocally support the crown. How much the monarchy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subjects should be allowed to actually taste the Kool-Aid was, however, a difficult question. Having ascended to the throne and married Philip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we are shown how carefully marshalled photojournalism remodelled an unfamiliar Greek interloper as an earthy, manly, steadying influence, just like good English husbands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the young Elizabeth II embarked on a world tour in the early 1960s, stepping out of the motorcade and focusing on the walkabout. By the end of her reign, millions of people felt directly connected to her because they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d met her, or at least been waved at from 20 yards away. Elizabeth herself had a good line on this: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have to be seen to be believed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But, as The Thick of It taught us, much of the business of spin consists of undoing the unintended effects of the previous PR stunt. When the endless footage of foreign visits led to the public getting the impression that Elizabeth was a neglectful mother because she was constantly off attending the openings of municipal buildings in Ceylon or Bermuda, photographs were commissioned of her family at home, doing ordinary, relatable things such as picnicking on vast lawns or leaning on castle walls in matching kilts. That dilemma became a crisis after the BBC broadcast Royal Family, a documentary two years in the making that showed Elizabeth and co\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s everyday, domestic lives. It was extremely popular on its first airing in 1969, but was later taken out of circulation by the palace because it was lifting the veil too high: it was too close to allowing punters to possess their own informed view of what the Windsors were like, which would mean they could no longer be told. Then, as a new kind of tabloid press arrived in the 1980s, someone else was shaping that narrative. A Life through the Lens doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really know what to do with the image-saturated modern phase of ruthlessly papped royalty, so it skips over it. But it does show us a great shot of Elizabeth on a meet-and-greet somewhere in Wapping. Hovering vampirically behind her is a thirsty Rupert Murdoch. At the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close, the royal historians and correspondents who have served as talking heads snap back into respectful tribute mode. Elizabeth is described with heart-clutching reverence as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This woman. This extraordinary woman\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but is also then referred to by two consecutive contributors as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an enigma\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The last portraits of her are dutifully overanalysed, the experts joining in with the pretence of believing they reveal something of Elizabeth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s character. Although there were fraught moments along the way, the effort to make us interact with the icon rather than the person was a success: by George, the old king was right.

Shaw was granted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good leaver\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd status by National Grid on resigning from her role as executive director \u00e2\u20ac\u0153given her overall long-term strong performance and contribution to the business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, meaning she was entitled to the share awards. She received a separate share award from the energy company worth about \u00c2\u00a31.8m last year and picked up \u00c2\u00a3152,000 in fees and benefits for her role on the board of British Airways owner IAG. Last week, the Guardian reported that Thames Water had been accused of conducting a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153flimsy PR stunt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd over its chief executive, Sarah Bentley, shunning her bonus, as the company will soon report that she received \u00c2\u00a3726,000 in extra payments on top of her \u00c2\u00a3750,000 salary. The daughter of a stockbroker, Shaw worked her way up the transport industry and was chief executive of the \u00c2\u00a36.2bn High Speed One rail line for five years until 2016. She received a CBE for services to transport in the Queen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New Year Honours in 2016. She spent six years at National Grid, receiving a pay packet of more than \u00c2\u00a32m in her final year. Water companies have been repeatedly condemned for dumping raw sewage into Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rivers and seas. Last month, some firms apologised and said they planned to invest \u00c2\u00a310bn to reduce spills of overflowing sewage into England\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s waterways. However, they were quickly pilloried for passing the bill on to customers. Yorkshire Water said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Any payment that Nicola Shaw will receive from National Grid relates solely to and was earned during her time there, has been fully disclosed and is completely unrelated to her work at Yorkshire Water. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nicola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision not to accept any bonus from Yorkshire Water this year was due solely to her strength of feeling about river health and to show her commitment to improving the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This decision was made out of principle and was made before the financial results had even been completed or any decision by the independent remuneration committee on what a bonus might have been.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shaw\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former boss, National Grid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, John Pettigrew, was criticised last week for receiving a pay bump to more than \u00c2\u00a37m as households struggle to pay their energy bills."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2023/jun/11/novak-djokovic-french-open-victory", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "All-conquering Novak Djokovic moves into house that Rafael Nadal built", "lead": "Wily record holder is now the uncontested keyholder to the French Open \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as well as the wider world of men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tennis", "author": "Jonathan Liew at Roland Garros", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T18:53:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764445", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ce20b5adbde1b21d8c4ea0a0e6629eb24319f981/0_254_4905_2943/500.jpg", "body": "No longer the polite and begrudging ripple of applause. No longer the soft shuffle of designer shoes towards the exits. This time the sound of triumph would be resounding and unqualified: from the plush seats where Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u00c4\u2021 and Tom Brady were on their feet, to the windswept upper tiers where the cascade of Serbian flags caught the evening Parisian light. Roland Garros, and by extension the lineage of men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tennis, is now the house of Novak Djokovic. He wore a royal red training top emblazoned with the number 23. He gave his victory speech in flawless French. And in the moments before he was called forward to accept the trophy, Djokovic was to be found reclining in his chair, eyes closed, a broad and cryptic smile on his face. He took his time, spoke for as long as he chose, because in your house you can do whatever you want. For years this was the house of Rafael Nadal, and spiritually perhaps it still is. Nadal was not here to witness his all-time men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grand slam title record being taken from him. But he will have been watching, bleakly aware that if it did not happen now it would happen in London, or New York, and there was nothing he or the gallant Casper Ruud could do about it. The GOAT thing. Must we? Can we not? Perhaps the only remotely novel insight anyone can add to this insufferable pub debate is that men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tennis has an opportunity to move beyond this wildly boring exercise in counting things and arguing about them. We get it: you have a favourite player and you like him very much. But can we now put a moratorium on this until Carlos Alcaraz gets to at least 15? Ruud, who collapsed so spectacularly against Nadal 12 months ago, was at least a wiser and more resilient presence here. He arrived with big dreams and an even bigger topspin forehand: looping through the sticky air, kicking viciously off the clay, a stroke that generates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rev for rev \u00e2\u20ac\u201c heavier spin than any other in tennis. The plan was to lift Djokovic out of his hitting zone, forcing him to hit from around his ears. It was his only plan. But it was a pretty good one. And as Djokovic served at 5-6 in the first set, the picture seemed to be blurring a little. Djokovic looked uncomfortable. He had played three drop shots and two overheads, and flubbed the lot. At which point he did what he often does in the crucial moments: he confected a row with the umpire, Damien Dumusois, over his pace of play, followed it with the best game of his match and for the next hour slowly dismantled this final piece by piece. No other athlete on earth can simply will himself into a devastating fury like this. Whatever it takes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a contentious line call, the crowd, an injury that exists entirely in his head \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Djokovic can turn on his piqued berserker mode as if flicking a switch. The tempo raises. He grunts a little louder. Those incredible yogi legs splay wider, shrinking the court before your eyes. And how useful that these tantrums seem to coincide with the key moments. Djokovic played 55 tie-break points at this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tournament. He won 42 of them, and made no unforced errors. And for the rest of the match Ruud looked like what he was: straight man, dancing partner, human canvas. Djokovic rolled out his box of tricks: the second-serve ace, the impossible rescue winner, an entire game of moonball forehands just to take the piss. In the VIP box, Kylian Mbapp\u00c3\u00a9 scrolled idly through his phone. A Mexican wave went round. The Serbians slowly raised the volume. You can always spot the Djokovic fans at a grand slam tournament. There is a definite type at these events. Bored-looking blond men in designer shades. Crudit\u00c3\u00a9-thin women who for some reason refuse to use their jacket sleeves. Against this backdrop of clinking champagne glasses and easy unearned wealth, the boisterous Team Nole crews stand out like a breadstick in a Martini. What must it be like to glimpse this walled garden party from the outside, particularly when you started life with as little as Djokovic did? If you build yourself a glass palace, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised if people want to break the windows. Roger Federer is gone now. Nadal is on his way out. Alcaraz is making a hell of a noise, but is still basically scaling the walls with a molotov cocktail, still trying to storm the palace rather than occupy it. Djokovic had to go through this same process, and it probably took him longer than anyone. But here he is: top of the heap, a triple champion at every grand slam tournament, his records safe for a generation and Nadal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public singing his name. This is Djokovic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world now. You can shout whatever you like before a point and all you will get is a shush from the people around you. You can essentially advocate wiping Kosovo off the map and face no consequence. On the internet and in the corridors of power, the doctrine of self-actualisation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the idea that the world exists simply to fulfil your chosen destiny \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is no longer sociopathy but orthodoxy. No wonder Djokovic was smiling in his chair. He is no longer the unruly trespasser, but the man who owns the deeds and the keys."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2023/jun/11/russia-ukraine-war-live-us-citizen-detained-in-moscow-ukraine-counteroffensive-reported-in-four-areas", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "Russia-Ukraine war live: Ukraine says flood evacuees killed by Russian attack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "Three people killed and 10 wounded after a boat heading to Kherson is shelled; about 100 captured soldiers from each side are returned", "author": "Donna Ferguson (now); Tom Ambrose and Christine Kearney (earlier)", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T18:37:31Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764446", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/88918cfd077c9fc730dffde7eff5d28da845ed54/0_478_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "Thank you for following developments today, we will now be closing this blog. You can read all our Ukraine coverage here. There are signs of some Ukrainian momentum on at least one point on the front line, on the western end of Donetsk region, south of the town of Velyka Novosilka. Two villages were officially reported liberated earlier on Sunday, Blahodatne, and Neskutchne. They were the first settlements officially confirmed liberated since the start of the counteroffensive a week ago. This evening, the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said a third village had fallen to the advancing Ukrainian forces, Makarivka, a couple of kilometres to the south. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the areas where our troops are on the defensive, no position was lost,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maliar added on the Telegram messaging app. Makarivka is believed to have been taken on Sunday morning. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By the way, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move our main forces yet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Ukrainian officer texted from the southern front. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So there are grounds to believe in the best.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The advance south from Velyka Novosilka represents the most significant gains of the counteroffensive to date, but the Ukrainian forces still have some way to go before they even reach the Russian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main fortified defensive line. My colleague Julian Borger is in Kyiv and is reporting on Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counteroffensive. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s armed forces have claimed to have liberated two frontline villages in western Donetsk, he writes, almost a week after the launch of counteroffensive operations. Soldiers were shown in video footage raising the Ukrainian flag over the village of Blahodatne, south of the town of Velyka Novosilka, one of the main axes of the counteroffensive so far. Troops from another brigade filmed themselves with their unit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banner in Neskuchne. You can read his full report here The time in Kyiv is coming up to 8.30pm. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a roundup of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s news about Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war in Ukraine. Three civilians have been killed and ten others people wounded after Russian forces opened fire on a boat carrying flood evacuees to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson. A 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back, Reuters reports. Two of the ten people wounded were law enforcement officers. Russia and Ukraine have simultaneously swapped nearly 100 prisoners each. The Ukrainian prisoners included members of the national guard and border guards who had been in action in several places, including near the city of Mariupol and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence ministry said Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt to attack a vessel of its Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along Turkstream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, the ministry said. The Kremlin has also said there was no foundation for talks with Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThere is practically no precondition for an agreement at the moment. Moreover, there is no foundation, even flimsy, for any kind of dialogue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the Kremlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Rossiya state television. In other key developments: Russian air defence systems have shot down a Ukrainian missile near the Russian-controlled port city of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov, the TASS news agency reported. Ukrainian troops said they had recaptured a village from Russian forces in the south-east, the first liberated settlement they have claimed since launching a counterattack this week. The settlement was identified as Blahodatne in Donetsk region in an unverified video. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the first results of the counter-offensive actions, localised results,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Valeryi Shershen, spokesperson for Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tavria\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd military sector, said on television. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence ministry said its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet in Kherson region, where the breach of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday led to major flooding. Russian forces also repelled three Ukrainian attacks in Zaporizhzhia region, the ministry said. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful mercenary said on Sunday that his Wagner fighters would not sign any contracts with the Russian defence ministry, hours after the minister, Sergei Shoigu, sought to bring volunteer detachments under its sway. In response to a request for comment, Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner group, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adding that the minister \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cannot properly manage military formations.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Wagner was integrated into the overall system and completely subordinate to the interests of Russia, he said, but its command structure would be damaged by reporting to Shoigu. Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said Russian forces blew up the Khakhovka dam to prevent Ukrainian troops from launching an offensive and advancing in the southern Kherson region. She said the action was also intended to help Russia deploy reserves to the Zaporizhzhia and Bakhmut areas. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence minister awarded medals to soldiers on Sunday after Moscow said its forces had destroyed four German-made Leopard tanks and five US-made Bradley fighting vehicles while repelling a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Sergei Shoigu was shown on state television awarding the Hero of Russia gold star, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest military honour, to soldiers who said they had destroyed enemy tanks and armoured vehicles. Two drones crashed early on Sunday in Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kaluga region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one near the village of Strelkovka, another in the woods in the Medynsky municipal district, according to the governor of the region, Vladislav Shapsha. There were no casualties and only minimal damage, Shapsha said on Telegram. A US musician was arrested in Moscow accused of selling mephedrone. Russian news media reported on Saturday that a US musician, Michael Travis Leake, who has lived in Russia for more than a decade had been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking, according to the Associated Press. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it from me, Donna Ferguson, and the Ukraine Live blog. Thanks for following along. If you want to read more news about Ukraine, you can do so here. The Ukrainian prisoners that Russia has just released included members of the national guard and border guards, Reuters reports. The head of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said those released had been in action in several places, including near the city of Mariupol and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. More details have emerged about the Russian attack on a boat carrying flood evacuees. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Three civilians died, ten more were wounded, including two law enforcement officers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the governor of Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said. In a statement on Telegram, he said a 74-year-old man used his body to shield a woman from Russian fire and was hit in the back and died. Russia and Ukraine have both simultaneously announced the return of nearly 100 soldiers from each side. The TASS news agency quoted Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence ministry as saying that 94 Russians in Ukrainian captivity had been released and would be taken to a medical institution to be examined. The head of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidential administration, Andriy Yermak, said that 95 Ukrainian service members had been returned, including some wounded, according to Reuters. Three people were killed and 10 wounded when Russian forces shelled a boat carrying evacuees from flooded occupied territory to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson, Reuters has just reported. It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clear whether this is the same boat in which six civilians were wounded that I referred to in my previous post. Six civilians were wounded on Sunday when Russian forces opened fire on a boat being used to evacuate civilians, Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief of staff has said. The civilians were fleeing from flooded, occupied territory to the Ukrainian-controlled city of Kherson, Reuters reported. The area they were in experienced severe flooding after the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam, which both Kyiv and Moscow have accused each other of deliberately blowing up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Russian army attacked a boat with civilians evacuating from the left bank of Kherson region,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They opened fire at the backs of civilians. Six people were wounded. They arrived in Kherson and were taken to hospital \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Doctors are fighting for the lives of the wounded,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote. Russian air defence systems have shot down a Ukrainian missile near the Russian-controlled port city of Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov, the TASS news agency has reported. Ukrainian troops said on Sunday they had recaptured a village from Russian forces in the south-east, the first liberated settlement they have claimed since launching a counterattack this week. Soldiers hoisted the Ukrainian flag at a bombed-out building in an unverified video published by Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 68th Jaeger Brigade, which identified the settlement as Blahodatne in Donetsk region, Reuters reported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing the first results of the counter-offensive actions, localised results,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Valeryi Shershen, spokesperson for Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Tavria\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd military sector, said on television. He said the village lay on the edge of the Donetsk and Zaporizhzia regions a few kilometres south of the Kyiv-controlled village of Velyka Novosilka. Ukrainian soldiers stand in front of a building with a Ukrainian flag on it in a location given as Blahodatne, Donetsk region. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence ministry said on Sunday that its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Su-25 fighter jet in Kherson region, where the breach of the Kakhovka dam on Tuesday led to major flooding. Russian forces also repelled three Ukrainian attacks in Zaporizhzhia region, the ministry said. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the reports. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence ministry said on Sunday that Ukraine had made an unsuccessful attempt to attack a vessel of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Sea fleet which was protecting natural gas pipelines. The ship was monitoring the situation along Turkstream and Blue Stream pipelines route in the Black Sea, the ministry said. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that counteroffensive and defensive operations were taking place in Ukraine, but would not say what stage they were at. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting what Putin said about our counteroffensive. It is important that Russia always feels this: that they do not have long left, in my opinion,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the Ukrainian president added. Zelenskiy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments came after Vladimir Putin claimed that Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-expected counteroffensive was already failing. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful mercenary said on Sunday that his Wagner fighters would not sign any contracts with the Russian defence ministry, hours after the minister, Sergei Shoigu, sought to bring volunteer detachments under its sway. Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Wagner group, has repeatedly attacked Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s militaryleaders for what he casts as treachery for failing to fight the war in Ukraine properly. Neither Shoigu nor the chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov have commented in public on Prigozhin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insults and criticism, Reuters reported. But the defence ministry said on Saturday that Shoigu had ordered all volunteer detachments to sign contracts with his ministry by the end of the month, a step the ministry said would increase the effectiveness of the Russian army. The ministry did not mention Wagner in its statement, but Russian media reported that it was an attempt by Shoigu to bring the mercenaries to heel. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Wagner will not sign any contracts with Shoigu,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Prigozhin said in response to a request for comment. He said Wagner was integrated into the overall system and completely subordinate to the interests of Russia, but that its highly efficient command structure would be damaged by reporting to Shoigu. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shoigu cannot properly manage military formations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, adding that Wagner coordinated its actions in Ukraine with general Sergei Surovikin, nicknamed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153General Armageddon\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the Russian media. Russian forces blew up the Khakhovka dam to prevent Ukrainian troops from advancing in the southern Kherson region, Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Sunday. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of blowing up the dam from inside its associated hydroelectric power station. The site has been under Russian occupation since the early weeks of the invasion in February last year. Moscow has blamed the destruction of the dam on Ukraine. Each side has accused the other of shelling civilians as rescue efforts are carried out, Reuters reported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The explosion of the Kakhovka hydroelectric power station was apparently carried out with the intention of preventing the Ukrainian defence forces from launching an offensive in the Kherson sector,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Maliar said on Telegram. She said the action, which unleashed a vast flood which inundated towns and villages, trapping residents and sweeping away homes, was also intended to help Russia deployreserves to the Zaporizhzhia and Bakhmut areas. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s defence minister awarded medals to soldiers on Sunday after Moscow said its forces had destroyed four German-made Leopard tanks and five US-made Bradley fighting vehicles while repelling a Ukrainian counteroffensive. Sergei Shoigu was shown on state television awarding the Hero of Russia gold star, Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest military honour, to soldiers who said they had destroyed enemy tanks and armoured vehicles. The soldiers did not identify the tanks in public. The defence ministry has published several videos and pictures in recent days showing strikes on Ukrainian-staffed armoured vehicles and tanks from Ka-52 attack helicopters and drones. Reuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield claims from either side. The Kremlin has said there is no foundation for talks with Ukraine. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThere is practically no precondition for an agreement at the moment. Moreover, there is no foundation, even flimsy, for any kind of dialogue\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, the Kremlin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Rossiya state television. The destruction of the Kakhovka dam was a fast-moving disaster that is swiftly evolving into a long-term environmental catastrophe affecting drinking water, food supplies and ecosystems reaching into the Black Sea. The short-term dangers can be seen from outer space \u00e2\u20ac\u201d tens of thousands of parcels of land flooded, and more to come. Experts say the long-term consequences will be generational. The Associated Press reported: For every flooded home and farm, there are fields upon fields of newly planted grains, fruits and vegetables whose irrigation canals are drying up. Thousands of fish were left gasping on mud flats. Fledgling water birds lost their nests and their food sources. Countless trees and plants were drowned. If water is life, then the draining of the Kakhovka reservoir creates an uncertain future for the region of southern Ukraine that was an arid plain until the damming of the Dnipro River 70 years ago. The Kakhovka Dam was the last in a system of six Soviet-era dams on the river, which flows from Belarus to the Black Sea. Then the Dnipro became part of the frontline after Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153All this territory formed its own particular ecosystem, with the reservoir included,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kateryna Filiuta, an expert in protected habitats for the Ukraine Nature Conservation Group. Houses and a sports stadium are seen underwater and polluted by oil in Kherson, Ukraine, yesterday. More now from that ISW daily update. Russian sources are claiming that Ukraine has tactical advantages in conducting assaults at night due to Western-provided equipment with advanced night optics systems. A prominent Russian milblogger claimed that Ukrainian forces are launching assaults at night because western-provided equipment provides Ukrainian forces with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153excellent\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd night vision optics. Russian sources have widely claimed that Ukrainian forces have started or intensified assaults at night in recent days, and Ukrainian forces may be increasingly leveraging the advantages provided by western systems. Reuters reports that two drones crashed early on Sunday in Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kaluga region, the governor of the region, Vladislav Shapsha, said on the Telegram messaging app. One drone crashed near the village of Strelkovka, another in the woods in the Medynsky municipal district. The Kaluga region borders the Moscow region to the north. According to preliminary information, there were no casualties and only minimal damage, Shapsha said on Telegram. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Earlier in the day inside Russia, 15 cars of an empty freight train derailed in the southern Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, the local governor said late on Saturday, adding there was no immediate information about the cause. The accident happened near a train station in the Alexeyevsky municipal district and the train was empty, Gladkov said. Reuters could not independently verify this report. Russian news media reported Saturday that an American musician who has lived in Russia for more than a decade has been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking, according to the Associated Press. The reports said Michael Travis Leake is suspected of selling mephedrone, whose effects are similar to those of cocaine and MDMA. A Moscow court ordered him to be held for two months in pre-trial detention, the reports said. He faces charges of production or distribution of drugs, which carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. An Instagram page under the name Travis Leake Instagram identifies him as the singer for the band Lovi Noch, meaning Seize the Night. News reports said Leake is a former paratrooper with the US military and has lived in Moscow since 2010. Russian drug laws are strict. WNBA star Brittney Griner was arrested in February 2022 after vape canisters containing cannabis oil were found in her luggage at a Moscow airport. She was sentenced to nine years in prison, but was released in December in an exchange for US-imprisoned Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The US state department said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that it was aware of the reports that a US citizen had recently been arrested in Moscow. It said when a US citizen is detained overseas, the department \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pursues consular access as soon as possible and works to provide all appropriate consular assistance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The department said it would have no further comment due to privacy considerations. Ukrainian forces are conducting counteroffensive operations in at least four areas of the front, the US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War had said in its daily update. Ukrainian eastern group of forces spokesperson Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty noted that Ukrainian forces advanced up to 1,400m in unspecified areas of the Bakhmut front, and Russian milbloggers reported Ukrainian advances northwest and northeast of Bakhmut, ISW says. Russian sources reported Ukrainian activity in Luhansk Oblast near Bilohorivka, while the Russian defence ministry and other Russian sources claimed that Ukrainian troops conducted localised attacks in the Donetsk-Zaporizhia Oblast border area, particularly in the Velyka Novosilka area. ISW reports geolocated footage posted on 10 June additionally indicates that Ukrainian forces in western Zaporizhia Oblast made gains during counterattacks southwest and southeast of Orikhiv. It says Ukrainian forces are unsurprisingly taking casualties in initial attacks against some of the best-prepared Russian forces in Ukraine. However, initial attacks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and particularly selected footage that Russian sources are intentionally disseminating and highlighting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are not representative of all Ukrainian operations. Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the war in Ukraine, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Christine Kearney bringing you the latest. Russian news media are reporting that an American musician who has lived in Russia for more than a decade has been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking, according to the Associated Press. The reports said Michael Travis Leake is suspected of selling mephedrone. A Moscow court ordered him to be held for two months in pre-trial detention, the reports said. An Instagram page under the name Travis Leake Instagram page identifies him as the singer for the band Lovi Noch, which means Seize the Night. Meanwhile US thinktank the Institute for the Study of War had said in its daily update that Ukrainian forces conducted counteroffensive operations in at least four areas of the front. More details shortly, in other key developments: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that counteroffensive and defensive operations were taking place in Ukraine, a day after Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin said Kyiv\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s long-vaunted drive to retake territory was well under way. Zelenskiy would not say what stage they were at, but to pass on to Putin that his generals were optimistic and in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpositive mood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Counterattacking Ukrainian forces have advanced up to 1,400 metres at a number of sections of the front line near the eastern city of Bakhmut in the past day, a Ukraine military spokesperson said on Saturday. The UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ministry of Defence said over the past 48 hours \u00e2\u20ac\u0153significant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ukrainian operations have taken place in several sectors of eastern and southern Ukraine. Ukrainian forces have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153likely made good progress\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153penetrated the first line of Russian defences\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the MoD added. However, in other areas \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ukrainian progress has been slower\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The Russian defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forces have continued \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unsuccessful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attempts in the past 24 hours to launch attacks south of Donetsk and in Zaporizhzhia regions, as well as in the area of the eastern city of Bakhmut. A drone attack by Russian forces killed three people and injured 27 people, including three children, in Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Odesa region in the early hours of Saturday, according to Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s southern command. Emergency services said but the fire had been rapidly put out and 12 people were rescued from the building. The UN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top aid official Martin Griffiths has warned Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s humanitarian situation is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hugely worse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after the Kakhova dam rupture. German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said on Saturday that he planned to speak to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on the phone soon to urge him to withdraw troops from Ukraine. Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s minister, Justin Trudeau, landed in Kyiv on Saturday and said Canada will be part of a multinational effort to train Ukrainian fighter pilots. He also announced C$500m ($375m) worth of military aid for Kyiv and said the destruction of the Nova Kakhovka dam was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153direct consequence of Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Russian activists and dissidents say Russian authorities in Kherson region are preventing 1,842 left bank residents, including 338 urgent cases around Olekshy, and nearby, from leaving. The figure includes 148 children and 243 elderly people, said the Anti-War Human Rights Coalition. Russia has fired missiles and attack drones at the central Ukrainian region of Poltava overnight, inflicting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153some damage of infrastructure and equipment\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the Myrhorod military airfield, according to the regional governor. A \u00c2\u00a3150m fund to help Ukrainians into their own homes has been announced by the UK government. More than 124,000 people have arrived in the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme since Russia invaded Ukraine in February last year. The UK will also provide an extra \u00c2\u00a316m of humanitarian aid to Ukraine after the destruction of the Kakhovka dam. Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iceland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to suspend its embassy operations in Moscow \u00e2\u20ac\u0153destroys\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bilateral cooperation adding the action would elicit a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153corresponding\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd response. The southern reach of the Dnipro River is likely to return to its banks by 16 June after the breach of Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kakhovka dam this week, a Russian-installed official said on Saturday. Vladimir Saldo said the water level at Nova Kakhovka, the town adjacent to the dam on the downstream side, had now dropped three metres (10ft) from Tuesday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak, Reuters reported. German investigators are examining evidence suggesting a sabotage team used Poland as an operating base to damage the Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea in September, the Wall Street Journal reported. Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nuclear energy agency says it has put the last operating reactor at Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest nuclear power plant into a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cold shutdown\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a safety precaution amid flooding from the collapse of the Kakhovka dam. South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has briefed Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about an upcoming mission to broker peace by African leaders to Russia and Ukraine to try and broker peace, Pretoria said on Saturday. The UN has helped boost Russian exports of food and fertilisers, facilitating a steady flow of ships to its ports ahead of an important grain deal deadline. Top UN trade official Rebeca Grynspan met with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy foreign minister Sergei Vershinin as Moscow threatens to walk away from a deal allowing the safe export of food and fertiliser from Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Black Sea ports on 17 July if obstacles to its own shipments are not removed."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/11/sturgeons-arrest-draws-focus-away-from-snp-policy-and-back-to-police-inquiry", "primaryCategory": "politics", "title": "Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest draws focus away from SNP policy and back to police inquiry", "lead": "Humza Yousaf is trying to seize back the media narrative but the party remains tethered to unanswered questions about its past", "author": "Libby Brooks and Severin Carrell", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T18:33:07Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764448", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/da6d8339029636aa13b85b24dfe0f8aa7eac6650/0_226_3046_1829/500.jpg", "body": "Supporters and critics of Nicola Sturgeon were in sombre mood as they digested news of the former first minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest on Sunday afternoon. To see Sturgeon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just earlier in the day described by her successor, Humza Yousaf, as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the most impressive politicians Europe has seen over the last couple of decades\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153arrested\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the same headline as the news alert flashed up on phones was a shock, despite speculation that it was inevitable given the continuing police investigation into the finances of the Scottish National party, which she led until recently. There are plenty who find it inconceivable that a woman they have trusted and admired for decades would be involved in criminality related to the party to which she has dedicated her political life. In a statement posted on Sunday, soon after her release without charge, Sturgeon said she was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grateful so many continue to show faith in me and appreciate that I would never do anything to harm either the SNP or the country\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Many are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scunnered\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that, just as Yousaf was managing to wrestle the media narrative back to the Scottish government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day job \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit one strewn with policy disasters such as the deposit return scheme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the focus is once again on the police inquiry, and the questions it raises around transparency and governance. Critics point out that when she was leader, Sturgeon welcomed the suspension from the party or relinquishing of the whip by other SNP politicians involved in police investigations, including Natalie McGarry, Michelle Thomson and Derek Mackay. Likewise, they believe the arrest of the former party leader is a profoundly serious moment for the SNP, while presenting further difficulties for her successor, who styled himself as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153continuity candidate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and appears unable to escape Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow. When her husband, Peter Murrell, and the then party treasurer, Colin Beattie, were arrested in quick succession, speculation was rife that Sturgeon would be next. But as the weeks passed, this feverish anticipation diminished, and Sturgeon seemed to gather herself. Friends suggest that her arrest on Sunday was something she had anticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in contrast to the visceral shock over her husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest and the search of her home \u00e2\u20ac\u201c likening it to an unwelcome procedure that has to be got through, like a tooth extraction. The worse scenario for Sturgeon was to have this hanging over her. They also suggest that her resilience is captured in an Instagram post, shared on Saturday, in which she revealed she had passed her driving theory test with a 50/50 score in the multiple choice section despite knowing that she would be arrested by arrangement within 24 hours. In recent weeks, Sturgeon has returned to business as usual as a backbench MSP, focusing on her constituency, where she has been increasingly busy with surgeries, casework and events as first-ministerial commitments have disappeared. After a strikingly emotional statement describing the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153trauma\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of her husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest, she has steered a careful path, taking part in friendly book-related events and even returning to the social media platforms where she had previously been a prolific poster. She made her first policy intervention since she stepped down, writing a column for Guardian Opinion in which she said the furious backlash against Scottish government plans to pilot juryless trials for rape cases was the latest example of the polarisation of politics that contributed to her resignation as first minister. She went on to write for the Daily Record, pledging to speak \u00e2\u20ac\u0153loudly and clearly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if promises she made to children in care were not met by the Scottish government, and revealing that she was thinking \u00e2\u20ac\u0153long and hard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd about becoming a foster mum. So where does her arrest leave the SNP? In April, MSPs, activists and officials described the shock, denial and soul-searching as they grappled not only with the chaos prompted by the first arrests and searches but by the fallout of the bruising leadership contest to replace Sturgeon, which exposed deep rifts within the party over independence strategy and policy direction. Polling has shown a marked fall in support for the SNP after Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation and the ensuing tumult, with strong indications that Scottish voters are now less likely to choose which party to back based on their constitutional preferences. The expected byelection in Rutherglen and Hamilton West, the seat currently held by the former SNP MP and Covid rule-breaker Margaret Ferrier, will be a crucial test of this potential sea change in Scottish politics with Labour viewing it as a way to send a message to voters UK-wide about its electability. But turmoil at Westminster over the weekend, resulting in another three byelections, could benefit the SNP if it results in Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resources and focus being split between multiple campaigns while voters may be more inclined to view their choice in a national rather than local context. As SNP members continue to absorb this latest \u00e2\u20ac\u201c once inconceivable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c development, there is frustration and, among some, despair that the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s future remains tied to unanswered questions about its past."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2023/jun/11/lancashire-v-hampshire-notts-v-warwickshire-county-cricket-live", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Lancashire enjoy dominant first day against Hampshire: county cricket \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as it happened", "lead": "Lancashire ended the first day three runs behind Hampshire with nine wickets in hand after a fine display with bat and ball", "author": "Tanya Aldred at Southport", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T18:27:37Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764450", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5f8287662932be2d0469061119ffc05a1e4c3e04/0_120_3600_2160/500.jpg", "body": "The grass was brittle-dry at Southport, a hot-fire outfield begging for quick runs. And it was Lancashire who made the most of the conditions, first bowling Hampshire out for 142, with three wickets each for Will Williams and Tom Bailey, and then letting fly with the bat. Phil Salt, opening the innings for Lancashire for the first time in red-ball cricket, eyed up the Championship\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best attack and advanced. He was dropped on four in the first over, off the hard working Keith Barker, and then pounced, combining flamb\u00c3\u00a9ed attack with, as stumps approached, watchful defence. Lancs finished the day just three runs behind, with the loss of only George Balderson, to the approval of more than 1500 spectators in fold-up chairs and sunhats. At Canterbury, Jordan Cox turned Kent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day upside-down with a sparkling century, transforming a miserable 41 for five into a respectable 301 all out. Wes Agar then took two early Surrey wickets to further twist the tale. Sam Billings was left out of the Kent side after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mutual discussions about form.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Alastair Cook, an old-fashioned knight in a sudden surfeit, reached his 74th first-class century accompanied by heat and a welcoming Chelmsford pitch. He was joined in the three-figures club by Matt Critchley, whose gung-ho hundred wearied the Somerset attack. New Taunton signing Shoaib Bashir, a 19-year-old off-spinner, was put through his paces, fizzing down 29 overs. Yorkshire, winless in the first tranche of Championship cricket, had a good day. Perhaps buoyed by their T20 Blast successes, they filleted Derbyshire for 111, Matt Fisher picking up a career-best five for 30, Ben Coad three for 28. By the close, Yorkshire were already 161 ahead, with five wickets in hand. Shan Masood collected his highest score of the season, Dawid Malan unbeaten on 76. Elsewhere, Sussex fought back against Worcestershire, rain again haunted Gloucestershire, and a century from Sam Hain put Warwickshire in a strong position against Nottinghamshire. Kiran Carlson conjured up another bewitching century, his fourth of the season, as Glamorgan were all out just a sneeze short of 400 at Durham. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pulling on the covers at Southport, the sun still out, the shadows long. Two and a half hours left of daylight. Glorious. The Hampshire coach Adrian Birrell was brutally honest afterwards: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Lancashire obviously read the pitch very well and they bowled very well to put us under pressure straight away. We looked at the stats and it was very hot and the pitch looked quite hard so we thought if we batted very well it would set it up for us spinning them out on the last day. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t materialise for us with the bat so we are in a bit of a hole and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to have to fight to salvage a draw or a remarkable win.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thanks for hanging about and all your messages on this surprise Sunday start. See you tomorrow \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good night! DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 360-4 v Somerset Canterbury: Kent 301 v Surrey 18-2 Southport: Lancashire 139-1 v Hampshire 142 all out Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Warwickshire 361-5 Division Two Chesterfield: Derbyshire 111 v Yorkshire 272-5 Chester-le-Street: Durham 4-0 v Glamorgan 390 Bristol: Gloucestershire 108-3 v Leicestershire rain Hove: Sussex 338-9 v Worcestershire And suddenly it is half past five, time for me to write up, with Yorkshire building a healthy lead against Derbyshire, Kiran Carlson leading the charge for Glamorgan, the rain chasing Gloucestershire, and Carlson and Shipley edging Sussex towards a third batting point. In Division One, Sir Alastair guides Essex, Jordan Clark has been out at Canterbury for 133, giving Kent a breath of a chance, Hain and Mousley building a strong base for Warwickshire and Hampshire running away with things at Southport. Do keep chatting BTL! Barker and Abbas have swapped ends. Hants have been dangerous but unlucky, but Lancs have made their own good fortune.Some listlessness and teapots in the field. Hants 63-0, Salt 38, Balderson 25. Love Ben Foakes? Let me provide some grist to your mill. Take that Div One defending champs! Cox reaches three figures with a reverse sweep off Moriarty and gallops onwards, now 122 off 178 balls, 16 fours, two sixes. A very strange looking Kent scorecard, three ducks at Nos 3, 4 and 5, then a huge century, and a flourishing tail. Kent 277-8, from the wreckage of 41-5. Easing Essex towards 300, cricket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only playing knight makes his 74th first-class hundred, in a career spanning twenty years. A great read by Ali Martin on Ben Stokes and all that: Phil Salt, opening the batting for Lancs for the first time in red-ball cricket, is having a rye old time. He just lofted Mohammad Abbas up and away to the rope. Lancashire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacking brio has already brought a change of bowling , Kyle Abbott replacing Keith Barker (4-16). This is a Baz-ball approved innings. A fantastic season for Carlson, this his fourth hundred of the season, and his second against Durham in 2023. Glamorgan 265-4. Abbas quietly asks Balderson if he edged behind, Balderson shakes his head and waves his hand. Next to me Jamie Bowman says that Abbas was built for one thing only, and it is so true. Liquid fast-bowler runs through his veins. Four overs in, Lancs have raced away to 18-0 and Hants need a breakthrough. And first blood goes to Phil Salt, in his first red-ball game this season, who on-drives him for four and then \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ah shucks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been dropped at first slip by Fletcha Middleton \u00e2\u20ac\u201c straight into the bread basket and out again. Salt responds with an off-drive for four more. An eventful first over. Hants 8-0. Keith Barker has the new ball and stands at the top of his mark. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 235-3 v Somerset Canterbury: Kent 211-8 v Surrey Southport: Lancashire v Hampshire 142 all out Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Warwickshire 224-3 Division Two Chesterfield: Derbyshire 111 v Yorkshire 182-2 Chester-le-Street: Durham v Glamorgan 251-4 Bristol: Gloucestershire 45-0 v Leicestershire rain stopped play Hove: Sussex 205-7 v Worcestershire With a wild swoosh, Crane makes a bid for the boundary and is caught by Blatherwick. Hampshire all out 142, which is more than it could have been, less than it should have been. Williams 3-14, Bailey 3-29. Hampshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top-scorer, Keith Barker with 44. Tea will be taken, tea scores to follow round the grounds. In the party division, the refreshments are from Betty\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tea room. At Chesterfield, Yorkshire already have a lead of 42 over Derbyshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dismal first innings, 153-2. 48 to Lyth, while Shan Masood is 45 not out off just 37 balls. Meanwhile \u00e2\u20ac\u201c wow! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Glamorgan. Since the de Leede double strike, Sam Northeast and Kiran Carlson have put on 165 at a pretty lick. Carlson 95 not out. Still raining at Bristol (45-0), while the clouds have also reached Hove, where Sussex are 205-7 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Leach 5-51, Oli Carter 76 not out. And here at Southport, Abbot skies a catch, Hampshire wriggle to 142-9, with tea on the horizon. Marnus in baggy green mode: This Trafalgar Road pitch can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite make up its mind, a short one leaps out of the tracks from Mitchell, then Barker thuds Hartley for six into the sightscreen and is bowled next ball for 44. Hants 134-8. Spin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first wicket. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s stroll round the Division One grounds. Keith Barker irritating Lancashire here at Trafalgar Road with some tasty blows, 32 not out, Hants 116 for seven in June bloom, sunhats on, collars up. Kent have lost Evison \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to Moriarty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for 58 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to break the sixth-wicket partnership of 121. Cox still there on 66, Kent 173-7. Alastair Cook 89 not out at Chelmsford, just 11 away from his first hundred of the season. Essex 206-3; while Al Davies fell just seven short of his hundred, lbw to Harrison. Warwicks 170-3. The rain stopped, play restarted at Bristol. After 3 and a half overs, the rain started again. Paul Edwards has just taken orders for mid-afternoon drinks in the Trafalgar Road tent.It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tough old life. Nicely done Al, now 79 not out, Warwickshire 141-2. While Jordan Cox is 55 not out, the partnership with Evison now worth exactly a hundred to haul Hampshire to respectability. Just realised that Surrey are fielding Dan Moriarty for the first time this year. Just thinking about Keaton Jennings, who made his royal 318 here last year against Somerset. His hamstring injury is as tricky as they come so Lancs are not putting a date on when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to be back. As I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m reading this excellent interview with Usman Khawaja by Andy Bull.. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6another Hampshire wicket falls , Dawson snaffled smartly at third slip. Hants 78-7. And another at Southport, and a third for Williams, as Organ is caught behind (Salt not Bell in the gloves) for two. Hampshire 72-6, and the spectators only four wickets from seeing Barker, Abbas et al, scrubbing their mark in the grass. What I said earlier about it being a day for batting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was just a flightly suggestion. Kent, though, have recovered, 104-5, and an unbroken sixth wicket stand of 64. And Raf\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report from New Road, where Southern Vipers easily beat The Blaze to hold onto their crown. Hampshire in danger of collapsing in front of the madding Southport crowd, as Ben Brown sends the ball into the clouds, returning safely into the bosom of Josh Bohannon. Hants 69-5. Almost as good as a Vince cover-drive. That before lunch wonder ball from Will Williams. In Essex\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 123-1. Yorkshire pad up, as Derbyshire limp to 111 all out. And there will be an inspection at Bristol at 2.30pm. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 111-1 v Somerset Canterbury: Kent 80-5 v Surrey Southport: Lancashire v Hampshire 57-4 Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Warwickshire 91-1 Division Two Chesterfield: Derbyshire 108-9 v Yorkshire Chester-le-Street: Durham v Glamorgan 89-3 Bristol: Gloucestershire 38-0 v Leicestershire rain stopped play Hove: Sussex 81-3 v Worcestershire Noooo! James Vince is bowled with the very last ball before lunch. Hampshire 57-4 and maybe Lancs read this pitch right after all. Ben Brown off the mark with a giddy little four, as we have a peek at Division Two: Oh Derbyshire \u00e2\u20ac\u201c why this? 99 for 9. Coad 3-25, Fisher 4-26, Thompson 2-28. Glamorgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s progress has been temporarily de-Leeded, with two wickets in two overs for Bas, 85-3. It was about this time last year that he provided lots of big-hitting entertainment in the white-ball love-in, in Amsterdam. It is still raining at Bristol (Gloucs 38-0) and a third wicket for Leach at Hove, Sussex 69-3. Umpire Mallender (I think) pauses long and hard and then sends a disconsolate Nick Gubbins on his way, lbw to Blatherwick. The Trafalgar Road public address announcer tells us that Australia have beaten India to become World Test Champions, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all delighted.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With twenty minutes till lunch, a skip round the grounds. India are down and nearly out \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 210 needed, but just one wicket left. At Chelmsford, Cook and Westley have calmed any approaching stormy waters after Browne was out, 90-1 against Somerset. Cox and Evison and fashioning a rearguard out of a sow\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ear at Canterbury, Kent 66-5. Three for Sean Abbott, two for Jordan Clark. Vince and Gubbins looking chirpy, if slow going, here at Southport, as the wagtails perch on the dry grass \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Hants 49-1.. And Warwicks 54-1 against Notts. A Tongue \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not tooth- less Worcestershire have Sussex 47-2, both wickets for Joe Leach. Clark and Haines the men out, already missing that man called Smith. Glamorgan have sped along to 65 for one, Zain-ul-Hassan the man gone for 24. And Vincey baby is looking glorious. Never mind the heatwave, in 2023 the rain always falls on Gloucestershire. Play suspended with Gloucs 38-0 against Leics. Great spot by Jamie Bowman sitting next to me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c both umpires (Bailey and Mallender) and the match referee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mike Smith \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are ex England Test-cricketers. Smith is wearing a very smart and pressed blue checked shirt. And if you want to watch the tail end of the WTC game, Daniel Gallan will keep you royally entertained: I see that Jake Ball has now picked up 200 f-c wickets for Notts, as well as 150 for the Outlaws, Rob Yates today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victim, Warwicks 30-1. A Crawley-less Kent are melting in the heat of Surrey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attack \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 35-4, ducks for Bell-Drummond and Denly. Three wickets for Abbott. This, too, could come to a swift conclusion. Some lovely packed lunches provided by Southport and Birkdale, and in the best traditions of school trips I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve eaten everything but the fruit already. Derbyshire, come now, think about the festival. Now 35-6 with four days looking unlikely. A sensational drop and roll catch at gully dismisses Weatherley for 15. Hants 20-2 . And here comes James Vince, touching his toes on the way to the crease. Hampshire scamper through for a quick single, the thud of boots on bone-dry pitch is deep and loud. One of the houses round the ground has cut down some of their back garden trees so there will be few shady areas as the sun rises. Make that Derbyshire 15-4. Fisher and Coad share the wickets. Shan Masood licks his lips against his old county. A day for batting so far round the grounds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and as I tap that Fletcha Middleton is caught behind, Hampshire 10-1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the only other wickets to fall at Chesterfield (Derbyshire 15-3) and Hove (Sussex 14-1). A lovely buzz around the ground and \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c some restful cloud and a light breeze. A loud appeal ricochets by to no result, and we have the first drinks break of the day. Right, what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on round the grounds? Damply nursing my hand with ice after a ball arrived in the press tent. Screaming fast outfield, Lancs have won the toss, Hampshire are batting. I fancy a Vince century for my Sunday. Two spinners for Hampshire, one for Lancs.

June flames in dry grass and high pollen as we return to the red ball dance. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve shifted west to Southport, blissfully five degrees cooler than Manchester, where the ground is prickly and hay-yellow, despite a thunderstorm last night. Surrey-chasing Hampshire are the visitors, Lancashire lolling down in eighth place. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one more festival game, at Chesterfield, where winless redballers Yorkshire are the visitors, while there is free entry at Bristol for Gloucestershire v Leicestershire. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just going to search for morning coffee amongst the fold up chairs and groundsman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hut \u00e2\u20ac\u201c back shortly! Yorkshire have won!\u00e2\u20ac\u201c five Blast matches -while Colin Graves has pulled out of the race to be the next chair of the club. Meanwhile , no luck for Middlesex in the Blast, who sit bottom of the south table with eight defeats in eight matches. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a bit of scrabbling round the houses: Warwickshire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Craig Miles joining Durham on a red-ball loan, a thigh injury has ruled out Gloucestershire\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Marchant de Lange for the season, Michael Neser will stay with Australia for the Ashes series in fact Glamorgan are somewhat stuck together with sticking plaster. Durham are not happy, nor are other counties, with the travel up and down the country in white ball pursuit before restarting the Championship today Oh and this: DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex v Somerset Canterbury: Kent v Surrey Southport: Lancashire v Hampshire Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire v Warwickshire Division Two Chesterfield: Derbyshire v Yorkshire Chester-le-Street: Durham v Glamorgan Bristol: Gloucestershire v Leicestershire Hove: Sussex v Worcestershire"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jun/11/manchester-city-champions-league-ascent-is-a-total-victory-for-politics-in-football", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Manchester City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s European ascent is a total victory for politics in football | Barney Ronay", "lead": "Nobody wants to talk about the repressive regime behind the club but Abu Dhabi pushes sport as a source of soft structural power", "author": "Barney Ronay in Istanbul", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T18:00:57Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764452", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f1d3595bbcc6fe407eca7b207a8c11f593d08ee6/0_111_4809_2885/500.jpg", "body": "Well, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that done. So. What now? Perhaps the funniest moment of the Champions League final at a distant, smoke\u00e2\u20ac\u2018tainted Ataturk Stadium was the sight of the tuxedo-clad Hungarian classical musician Adam Gyorgy thundering his way through the tournament tune on a gleaming pitchside grand piano pre\u00e2\u20ac\u2018kick\u00e2\u20ac\u2018off, trying really hard to give this hammy faux\u00e2\u20ac\u2018anthem some verve and twinkle. All the while, 100 metres off to his left, 10,000 blue-shirted Manchester City fans doggedly booed every flourish, every attempt to inject a little feeling into the occasion. No, Adam. Please. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really not you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just, well, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kind of a long story. It was that kind of evening, full of surprising tones and textures. Although in many ways this was also the perfect Big Football final. Here we have a global TV product staged inside a dictator-built stadium, featuring a dictator\u00e2\u20ac\u2018owned champion team and another in a state of ongoing FFP\u00e2\u20ac\u2018induced financial levitation. And in the middle of that lighted bowl the old familiar centrepiece, a game that is still capable of communicating beauty and pleasure, watched by a group of people still capable of being moved by the spectacle, still able to feel something, even if that something is the urge to boo an earnest Hungarian pianist. The first lesson from Saturday is that City are fine and deserving champions. This is by some distance the best football team in Europe, a model of graft, team\u00e2\u20ac\u2018building and creative tactics. City may or may not, as L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00c3\u2030quipe suggested in its report on the game, be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153moral in the way in which the club has built its strength\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the team itself is a model of aesthetics and good practice. Not to mention, as is often overlooked, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a generous and magnificent loser\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in their previous defeats, which will make it even sweeter now to win with a bit of a grind. Pep went with the super-secure quadruple centre-back system in Istanbul, which has coincided with a powerful drawing down of the shutters. There is a tactical irony here. Signing Erling Haaland, the ultimate razor edge, has had the unexpected consequence of transforming City into an annihilating defensive force. The four centre\u00e2\u20ac\u2018backs are in part to compensate for Haaland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lack of touches higher up the pitch and the ever-constant fear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Pep\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great demon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of counterattack. You wonder how many Champions League titles they might have won if Guardiola had simply played his best pure defenders more often. It probably means something that City won in Istanbul with Haaland completing only three passes in 90 minutes. Other positives: by the end City had four English outfield players on the pitch, evidence that this outsourced entity can still speak to the parks and pitches and levels down the pyramid that gave us players such as Kyle Walker and John Stones. City have played beautiful football, scored wonderful goals, changed the game around them. The players seem nice. The ripped jeans Euro-bro outfits were pretty cool. And yet, of course, there is another game here. City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory means this was also a day when football changed in a very basic sense. For the first time the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s premier club competition was won by a nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2018state team. The most powerful, most successful club in the world is now owned, funded and run as a public relations glove puppet by a repressive nation state. Those who watch and consume this sport don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to care about any of this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the end of anything just yet. The cartel will survive. Barcelona and Real Madrid have mortgaged the future to keep up with the present. Those good old boys will still be drinking whisky and rye. In any case footballing success has never really been pure. Every club era is built out of ruthlessness, money and egomaniacal owners. This, though, is something new, a club era built instead from state power and the hands of an anti\u00e2\u20ac\u2018democratic state, a machinery that is, by its nature, not soft or benevolent or free of collateral baggage. Before the game kicked off the sense of power-flash was present, as ever, in the stuff at the edges. The VIP tunnel had the usual ooze of fl\u00c3\u00a2neuring celebs. Here is Aleksander Ceferin, Uefa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, fingers crossed, trying not to look at the travel chaos behind him. Here is Lu\u00c3\u00ads Figo in sunglasses so large they seemed to cover at least 40% of his face. Here is the great Salt Bae, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leading celebrity meat-slicer, working the carpet, never at any stage removing his salting arm from behind his back, always on. In the event Salt turned out to be the only notorious butcher in the house as rumours of an appearance by Bashar al-Assad of Syria proved unfounded. But other power brokers did turn up. Sheikh Mansour of Manchester City was present to see his second ever game. Just as significant, his brother was also there, Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the current president of the UAE. Family business, meet family club. And this is at least an unobstructed view of the power dynamic in play. There is no need to run through the human rights record of City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners. Repressive laws and the crushing of free speech, war crimes and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black sites\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Yemen, a conflict for which the UK continues to supply arms. How about the arbitrary detention and deportation of 375 African migrant workers not so long ago, seized from their homes \u00e2\u20ac\u0153on the basis of skin colour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, locked up, subjected to degrading treatment without any form of process, according to a Amnesty International report. One Nigerian worker reported being handcuffed in her night clothes and sexually assaulted by police before being taken to a prison camp. As she complained, the police officers simply said: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEmirates give. Emirates take.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And yes, nobody really wants to talk about this. The football is on. And these are, after all, the sports pages. But the fact is the people making this part of the football chat are not journalists, haters or Manchester United fans. The people making us talk about this are the government of Abu Dhabi, who insist on pushing sport as their personal publicity megaphone, source of soft structural power, wealth extraction, and reverse\u00e2\u20ac\u2018colonial interest in biddable post-industrial cities. City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ascent is total victory for politics in football. What it means now is more of the same from other interested parties, with all the attendant fallout and compromise. As Qatar stalks the fringes, as Saudi Arabia embeds itself at Newcastle United, the prospect of a regional ego-duel played out through this fragile old cultural industry should be a cause for genuine concern. Take your eyes off the money. This is not how sport is supposed to work. It will mean more strain too on the financial rules, and more narrowing of the always-narrow pyramid. The financial cheating charges against City, all denied, feel like a structural inevitability, a basic friction between the approach to business of a multi-billionaire absolute monarchy, and the urge to protect the existing order, good and bad, in a Victorian community sport. But the fact is the rules do exist. Victory in the final comes exactly three years since City completed their appeal in Lausanne against being banned from the same competition, charges that were then overturned. There will presumably be medals now too for the selected 11 that day (yes: City brought 11 lawyers to the courtroom), all part of that lingering threat of simply consuming European football\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing body in litigation, one vast footballing Slapp (strategic lawsuit against public participation) suit. Who knows? Perhaps City can now take that same spirit into the domestic courtroom and complete an unprecedented double, taking down both Uefa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in-house legal team and the 115 Premier League charges currently outstanding. Perhaps the question will be posed in time as to who is the real key signing of the current era? Erling Haaland, king of goals? Or Lord Pannick, Kings Counsel? Either way, expect more now, more fuel for what seems the most likely outcome of the next few years, a basic schism in the way elite club football will be run; and a further junking of those old structures which, frankly, go right against the governing ethos of billionaire globalism. The same goes, for now, for the Premier League\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance of world football, the hoovering up of talent, expertise, coaches, players, eyeballs, power. It is no coincidence that City bolted on Barcelona\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own in-house brain trust, then rose to a similar position of dominance, while Barcelona have done brainless and self\u00e2\u20ac\u2018destructive things. And this is of course a system that will ultimately devour itself, kill the competition, suck the product dry. Nation state propaganda-football gives. Nation state propaganda-football takes. As a final note there is the wider note, not so much of unease but of coldness. What does this model of sport actually express? The pre\u00e2\u20ac\u2018existing expertise of others? The triumph of global capitalism? The fact that boundless government-backed financial stability, plus boundless talent and expertise will ultimately equal success? The overriding emotion at the end of City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory in Istanbul seemed to be relief, satisfaction at a job completed, an outcome that always seemed inevitable, not so much heart and soul and unbound celebrations as the quiet satisfaction of well-to-do middle\u00e2\u20ac\u2018aged tourists visiting the Grand Canyon because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the bucket list and coming away saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well, it was a trek but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m glad we went\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. At times it can feel as though the dominant emotion of City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transformation is anger, defiance, a hunger for incoherent online argument. It is a great shame that there is no coherent sense of care, duty and regulation in any form of club ownership, not just this one, no sense of caution and scepticism, just sharp elbows and the desire, lets face it, for a little easy escapism. That structure is now fully embedded. And as of Saturday night the game has changed for good, moving just a little further down its own unmapped journey."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/11/us-musician-travis-michael-leake-arrested-in-moscow-denies-drug-trafficking-accusations", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "US musician arrested in Moscow bewildered at drugs charges", "lead": "Travis Michael Leake, described as someone who loves Russia, says \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m here.

In it, the network said, Leake had complained about censorship on the US music television station MTV. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was a documentary series about musicians standing up and risking their lives in some cases, to stand up against government abuse of power, government corruption,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Leake said, according to the network. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And yet, a foreign government was able to editorially control what Americans viewers see on their TV screens.

With his neck broken in five places, the lifelong Manchester City fan spent four weeks in a coma in the Royal Preston hospital. Whiling away the hours in his hospital room while watching him slip in and out of consciousness, his family spoke to him about football and what would be the upcoming final of the Champions League. They were worried that his injuries were so severe, he would never have the capacity to talk again. But on Sunday morning his lips moved, for the first time since the crash, and slowly he mouthed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MCFC the treble\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Manchester City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meteoric rise in recent years culminated on Saturday night in a Uefa Champions League win, making them only the second English men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team to complete the treble, after they scooped the Premier League and FA Cup trophies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been obsessed with City his whole life,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Theo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father, Rob Owen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[People] don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand the importance of football, what it means to us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For a club that has spent most of its history in the shadow of its storied neighbour Manchester United, it has been a long journey. The club has been transformed since Sheikh Mansour, an Abu Dhabi royal, bought the club in 2008, and particularly since the esteemed manager Pep Guardiola joined in 2016. The rest, they say, is history. At the Etihad on Sunday, Man City supporters were some of the first to snap up new club shirts with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Champions of Europe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd written in gold on the back above the number 23, marking the year it all happened. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surreal. It hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really sunk in yet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tom Baird, who was born in 1999, the year City won the third-tier playoff and were promoted to the second tier. His fiance, Keira Pye, added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the thing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been dreaming about your whole life. The stars aligned. We were all over the place at the start of the game, but once Pep talked to them at half-time, he calmed them down.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite losing star midfielder Kevin De Bruyne to injury in the first half, the team secured a 1-0 win over rivals Internazionale of Milan with a goal by Rodri in the 68th minute. Manchester City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s victory was their 300th under Guardiola. Fans swarmed Piccadilly Gardens in the centre of Manchester on Saturday night, bursting out of the city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pubs in celebration of the win. Police descended on the revellers and a police vehicle was smashed, but only one arrest was made, as the majority of people \u00e2\u20ac\u0153took part in the celebrations safely and respectfully\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Greater Manchester police said. Baird and Pye watched the game at home with family. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My dad just sobbed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Baird. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seen us a lot worse than I remember. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 57. Never in his lifetime has he ever seen anything like this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pye agreed: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The amount of stick that they got back then when Man U were doing so well!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Baird, who spent Sunday morning rewatching the game, added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just the best time of my life. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to get a tattoo. I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t thought much about it, but maybe the Champions League trophy and the date.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The pair put the win down to Guardiola\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management, but had suddenly developed a soft spot for Ederson, the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brazilian goalkeeper, who saved three goals in seven minutes during the final in Istanbul. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the man of the match by a country mile,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pye said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He won us the treble, as far as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m concerned.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The couple acknowledged that the win would not have come without the large sums of money poured in in recent years, enough to make it unpopular among the older clubs. In February, the Premier League charged Man City with breaching financial rules on more than 100 occasions over multiple years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If it gets proved, we deserve to be punished,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Baird said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But different teams dominate over different periods, it could be anyone. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pendulum, a swing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pye agreed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We might not do it again. Every team deserves to have their moment in the sun.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The finances failed to cast much of a shadow over City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home ground, which was teeming with families on a sunny Sunday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Amazing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was how Steve Allwood felt, having driven from Nottingham on Sunday morning with his daughter Jodie and seven-year-old grandson Zachary, who was clad in full Man City kit. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I said it right from day one, we were going to win the treble. I should have put money on it. It was worth a tenner at the start of the season. I just thought this was our year. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been so close for so long, knocking on that door.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The club plans to celebrate the win with an open-top bus parade through the city on Monday. But for Theo, the celebration will be confined to his hospital room, which will be newly adorned with the Man City flag that his father bought on Sunday. He is being weaned off the intubator, allowed to breathe alone for 15 minutes at a time four times a day, and is regaining consciousness. He will soon be transferred to the spinal unit at Southport to begin a difficult journey of recovery. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It will be a long road,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rob said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve contacted the club about Theo, but I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t heard anything yet. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got pictures of him as a kid wearing every City kit. The club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always been so important to him. I know it would mean a lot to him to hear from them, give him a boost. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in the hospital with him now and she was trying to talk to him, but he just wanted to watch the highlights.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/the-guardian-view-of-boris-johnsons-resignation-good-riddance", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "The Guardian view on Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation: good riddance | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Tory infighting might benefit a country desperate for the unified, tolerant political leadership that the Conservatives can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t supply", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T17:30:57Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764457", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ea8fd3f9e4c63f71408d37b04ca2e5ae9b7f77a1/0_1_5760_3456/500.jpg", "body": "In office, Boris Johnson never took the blame for his mistakes, and never thought there was a time to walk away with dignity. So it was hardly a surprise that when his parliamentary lies caught up with him on Friday, he resigned as an MP with a psychologically revealing parting shot. In his own mind, Mr Johnson was a victim not of the facts and evidence but of a cross-party committee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153egregious bias\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It never occurred to him that a leader overthrown amid chaos \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as he was last summer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c should take responsibility for the disarray. Mr Johnson was not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153forced out of parliament\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He ran away from a fight with the Commons privileges committee, whose report into Partygate apparently lands knockout punches that floored Mr Johnson. The yet-to-be-published conclusion is expected to say that Mr Johnson misled parliament about lockdown parties while prime minister; the committee was expected to recommend his suspension as an MP for more than 10 days, which could have led to a byelection that Mr Johnson didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he would win. A handful of Tory backbenchers do believe Mr Johnson, though mutterings about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kangaroo court\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd will be muted after the privileges committee threatened to censure its critics. Speculation is rife that two supporters \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Nadine Dorries and Nigel Adams \u00e2\u20ac\u201c resigned their seats in a fit of pique, having been omitted from the list of new peerages in Mr Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shabby resignation honours list. More Johnson allies will probably leave parliament early along with their leader. Rishi Sunak risks losing a series of byelections. Given his party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poor standing in opinion polls, this will make Tory MPs nervous about their future. Mr Johnson knows the Tories can only move on from his circus if he leaves quietly, without recrimination. But he is determined to create mischief for Mr Sunak, whom he believes to be behind his downfall. The pair deserve each other. Mr Johnson failed to deal with questions of inequality and insecurity posed by the pandemic. Mr Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiscal conservatism is equally unsuited to answering them. Both men are also embroiled in a row over Mr Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to deny the official Covid-19 inquiry unredacted versions of Mr Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s WhatsApp messages and personal diaries. The prime minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to go to court over the matter has raised the obvious question about what he is trying to hide. Narcissism and opportunism lie at the root of Mr Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics. He looks to profit from the chaos he brings to public life, seeking refuge in paranoia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There is a witch-hunt under way,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Johnson claimed in his resignation letter \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd His removal is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the necessary first step\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a concerted attempt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to this end. This is a self-serving delusion. Leaving the EU has damaged Britain, but there is a political consensus about making the best of a bad deal. Mr Johnson was, and is, unfit to lead the country. He would do better to learn from his setbacks, rather than live in denial of what caused them. But he won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. Instead he will probably try to ruin Mr Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prospects through well-paid speeches and columns. Paradoxically, this might benefit a country desperate for the unified and tolerant political leadership that the Tories can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t supply. Conservative members might be fooled, but most of the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s MPs know Mr Johnson to be a lazy, selfish dilettante. They, wisely, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want him back in parliament.

Mahmoud Abbas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four-day visit, which is scheduled to begin on Tuesday, has been described by Chinese state media as aimed at facilitating new talks predicated on a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict. It also comes on the heels of Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent success in brokering a detente between the Middle East\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two major religious and geopolitical poles, Saudi Arabia and Iran. But Palestinian and Israeli sources told the Guardian that Abbas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 high-profile trip was more about burnishing the standing of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Xi Jinping, as a global statesman, and diplomatic breakthroughs are not expected. The last direct peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian officials, brokered by Washington, were held in 2014. Since then, the massive growth of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank has rendered a two-state solution all but impossible. Israeli politics has also continued a steady march rightwards, and Abbas\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corrupt and repressive Palestinian Authority (PA) now has little legitimacy either at home or abroad. Yet, in December, on the sidelines of a summit between China and Arab nations held in Saudi Arabia, Xi met Abbas and publicly pledged to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153work for an early, just and durable solution to the Palestinian issue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The message was reiterated in April, when Chinese state media reported that the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s foreign minister, Qin Gang, had told his Israeli and Palestinian counterparts by phone that Beijing was willing to aid peace negotiations. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This invite is ostensibly timed to coincide with the 35th anniversary of Palestinian-Chinese relations, which is a strange thing to mark, given China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s longstanding support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) before that. This is about China showing its power and making the US look weak,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a senior PA source, who asked not to be named so that they could speak freely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Xi is meeting with lots of Arab leaders because he knows they are not happy with the US taking a back seat in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Abbas has not been invited to see [US President Joe] Biden yet,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they said. Relations between China and Israel are currently cool: the latter is wary of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic ties to Iran, and Israeli officials have been increasingly frank with Beijing that the country remains closely aligned to the US on foreign policy. That no Chinese invite has been extended to an Israeli delegation also suggests major diplomatic accomplishments will not be forthcoming from the trip; at most, expectations include more Chinese sponsorship of the Palestinian fight for statehood in international forums, and modest increases in humanitarian funding pledges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Israel is in this strange Jekyll-and-Hyde scenario where we have divorced geopolitical considerations from economic relationships with many countries, including China. And honestly, when I asked senior officials what they make of this development, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the Chinese foreign minister\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name, or anything about the Global Security Initiative,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Tuvia Gering, a researcher with the Guilford Glazer centre at Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Institute for National Security Studies, referring to Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ambitious new foreign policy. Despite seeming parallels, there is no official Palestinian position on the plight of China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s persecuted Uyghur people. A delegation of Arab League diplomats visited Xinjiang province last week, a move widely criticised by rights groups as whitewashing Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s human rights abuses against the Muslim minority. In the last year or so, Israel, reportedly at the behest of the US, has denounced Beijing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies in Xinjiang at the UN. China has repeatedly criticised Israel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s occupation of the Palestinian territories in recent years and, in particular, military operations in the blockaded Gaza Strip. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no conditions or foundations that make peace talks feasible at any time in the near future,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gering said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Beijing knows that. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy virtue signalling, positioning China as the global saviour of Islam despite what is happening to the Uyghurs.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-arctic-threatened-by-putins-war", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "The Guardian view on the Arctic: threatened by Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war | Editorial", "lead": "<strong>Editorial:</strong> Geopolitical fallout from the conflict in Ukraine is threatening an environmentally crucial region", "author": "Editorial", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T17:25:56Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764460", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/9b70e28ed526fa49fa7c4aa88fd8ce4ceadeb9a2/299_0_4629_2778/500.jpg", "body": "As the cold war thawed in the 1980s, the frozen high north of the planet was a leading beneficiary of more conciliatory times. Speaking in Murmansk in 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev called for an end to military competition in the Arctic, and a new focus on preserving its unique ecosystem. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The community and interrelationship of the interests of our entire world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the Soviet leader, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is felt in the northern part of the globe, in the Arctic, perhaps more than anywhere else.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mr Gorbachev\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words paved the way for a cross-state consensus around the idea of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Arctic exceptionalism\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an agreement that in an environmentally crucial region, where Europe, North America and Asia meet, geopolitical rivalries should be put to one side. Since 1996, the Arctic Council, comprising the eight Arctic states including Russia, has embodied that spirit of cooperation. It is yet another disastrous consequence of Vladimir Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war in Ukraine that it is now at risk. Since Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s invasion in 2022, the council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s western members have rightly refused a business-as-usual approach with Moscow. At a scientific level, this has meant lack of access to crucial data and the pausing of joint projects. That is no small matter, given that 40% of the Arctic is Russian. Meanwhile, the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201c increasingly accessible due to disappearing sea ice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are being sucked into the fallout of Mr Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s war. In the sanctions-hit Kremlin, the alarming pace of global heating in the Arctic is being viewed primarily as an economic opportunity in tough times. Turning away from Europe, Mr Putin is stepping up collaboration on Arctic projects with China, following President Xi Jingping\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent visit to Moscow. In March, Russia announced the creation of a joint working body with Beijing to develop the Northern Sea Route, which connects the eastern and western parts of the Arctic Ocean. An \u00e2\u20ac\u0153energy superhighway\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd between Europe and Asia has become a high-priority strategic goal. China has already declared its aspirations for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153polar silk road\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd linking the two continents. As well as facilitating shipping routes, melting sea ice promises much easier access to abundant untapped oil reserves, gas and raw materials. In 2008, the United States Geological Survey estimated that the Arctic region contained the equivalent of more than 400bn recoverable barrels of oil. The exploitation of such resources, along with natural gas, would be entirely incompatible with global climate targets, and the European Union has committed to keeping Arctic oil and gas in the ground. But Russia is expanding its operations, not contracting them. The clear danger is that the breakdown of collaboration in the region, combined with Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pivot to the east, leads to what the Finnish foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, has described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an Arctic area with no common goal for climate change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Given that respect for the sovereignty of states is one of the Arctic Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s founding principles, it is difficult to see how Russia can be treated as a normal member while its war continues. On the other hand, the development of a competing Sino-Russian strategy for the region, making it a new theatre of great-power rivalry, is a deeply alarming prospect. Last week it was reported that the 2030s will see the first ice-free Arctic summers.

Her plays, short stories, novels and essays explored the experiences of women in contemporary Africa, both rural and urban \u00e2\u20ac\u201c women who are remarkable for their spirit, humour and resilience. Aidoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play The Dilemma of a Ghost, first staged in 1964 at the Ghana Drama Studio when she was 22, was issued by Longman in 1965, making her the first published female African dramatist. This play contrasts a young African- American wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idealised concept of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mother Africa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the reality of her Ghanaian husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s African mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traditions and expectations, often conflicting with the values embraced by a younger western-educated generation. Like her second play, Anowa (1969), The Dilemma of a Ghost draws on both African and western performance traditions. In these plays and many of her short stories, Aidoo created an Africanised form of English for her characters, drawing on her native Akan idioms and sentence structures. While her first play examines cultural conflicts in contemporary Ghana, during the optimism created by Kwame Nkrumah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s success in achieving independence, Anowa, written after the 1966 military coup that deposed Nkrumah amid accusations of corruption, reflects on Ghanaian history and the complicity of African chiefs with slavery. In the face of political dereliction, the play calls for a shift away from materialism and self-interest. However, it is Aidoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fiction that has reached a worldwide audience. Her first volume of short stories, No Sweetness Here, was published in 1971. Many of the stories were written to be read on radio, with listeners as well as readers in mind, combining traditional oral storytelling, and communal participation, with European reader-oriented narrative techniques. They also showed how western technology can be put to the service of African culture rather than replacing or subduing it. The use of oral traditions also allowed Aidoo to give a voice to women, in a context where female writers have been marginalised, while the concentration on dialogue, rather than exterior description, places the emphasis on women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subjectivities, emotions and thoughts, rather than their appearance. The title of Aidoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first novel, Our Sister Killjoy: Or Reflections from a Black-eyed Squint (1977), conveys the narrator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wry self-deprecating humour, together with her awareness of differences in perception. Recounting the experience of a young Ghanaian woman who spends several months in Germany \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the heart of whiteness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and with two male characters both called Adolf, the novel is in part a reversal of Joseph Conrad\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Heart of Darkness. Indeed there is a literal heart of darkness in the novel when a group of Africans debate the ethics of Christiaan Barnard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transplant of the heart of an African man. Aidoo uses a variety of narrative techniques in the novel, contrasting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153knowledge gained then\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153knowledge gained since\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, interspersing prose with fragments of verse, while questioning the usefulness of the English language to express African experience: A common heritage. A Dubious bargain that left us Plundered of Our gold Our tongue Our life \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while our Dead fingers clutch English \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Together with Aidoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second novel, Changes: A Love Story, which won the Commonwealth Writers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 prize in 1992, Our Sister Killjoy appears frequently in university courses on postcolonial and women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s writing. Aidoo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1985 collection of poetry, Someone Talking to Sometime, was awarded the Nelson Mandela prize for poetry. A second volume of poetry, An Angry Letter in January, appeared in 1992. She also published two more volumes of short stories, The Girl Who Can and Other Stories (1997) and Diplomatic Pounds and Other Stories (2012), as well as books for children. Christine Ama Ata Aidoo was born, with a twin brother, Kwame Ata, at Abeadzi Kyiakor, near Saltpond in central Ghana (at that time known as the Gold Coast), the daughter of Maame Abasema and Nana Yaw Fama. Her father was chief of Abeadzi Kyiakor, and she belonged to Fante royalty. He founded the first school in Saltpond, and ensured that both his children received a good education there. Aidoo later spoke of the importance of the village storyteller, around whom the villagers would gather in the evenings. From 1957, the year that Ghana became the first independent African nation, she attended Wesley girls\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 senior high school in the city of Cape Coast. There she became aware of Ghana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s connection with the history of slave trading, embodied in the Cape Coast \u00e2\u20ac\u0153castle\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where captured slaves were held before being shipped to Europe and the Americas. In 1961 she enrolled at the University of Ghana to study English, and also began writing seriously. The following year she was selected by a panel including Chinua Achebe, Langston Hughes, and Wole Soyinka to attend a writing workshop in Ibadan, Nigeria. She forced her way into the Nigerian Broadcasting office in order to meet Achebe, who was then head of external broadcasting, breathlessly announcing to him that she had \u00e2\u20ac\u0153indeed arrived at the shrine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. After graduation, Aidoo taught at universities in Africa and the US. She was appointed Ghanaian minister for education in 1982 after Jerry Rawlings gained power in a military coup, but in 1983 resigned and moved to Zimbabwe, where she worked for the Zimbabwe Ministry for Education. When she returned to Ghana in 1999, she and her daughter Kinna Likamanni established the Mbaasem Foundation, which sought \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to support the development and sustainability of African women writers and their artistic output\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Throughout her life, Aidoo saw her writing and other activities as part of her endeavour to help Africans recover from the consequences of colonialism.

Even those with visas for the Schengen zone can be turned away, and the national airline LOT regularly bars Russians from boarding its flights. Many Poles have a long-standing wariness of Russia seeded by centuries of Russian imperial designs on Poland and the more recent experience of Moscow-backed communist rule, and the feelings have only been hardened by last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But even as most Russian citizens are unwelcome in Poland, the Russian language is heard ever more frequently in the country. By now, Warsaw has become probably the most Russian-speaking city outside the countries formerly part of the Soviet Union. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My friend from Belarus was here last weekend, we walked along the street and counted the languages we could hear and it felt like Polish was in the minority. We heard a lot of Russian and some Ukrainian,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Yahor Perakhod, a Belarusian who runs GiGi, a central Warsaw bar where the clientele is mostly Belarusian exiles. Polish speakers still make up the overwhelming majority of Warsaw\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population, but Russian speakers are by far the most noticeable linguistic minority, and their increasing prevalence over recent years has come incrementally, and for different reasons. The most significant factor was last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which saw millions of Ukrainians leave for Poland. Around a million have stayed, adding to a large Ukrainian population already in the country. Statistics suggest there are currently more than 3 million Ukrainians living in Poland, meaning around 8% of the Polish population are Ukrainian citizens. The majority of war refugees still in Poland are from eastern Ukraine, where Russian is the predominant language, and where the fighting is more intense, meaning many have nowhere safe to return. Even before the full-scale war in Ukraine, the 2020 protests in Belarus led to tens of thousands of Belarusians, mostly Russian-speaking, fleeing their homeland and taking advantage of Poland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatively liberal residency laws for Belarusians. At GiGi bar, where the guests sip on gin and tonics and take photographs of caviar dishes for their Instagram stories, all the staff and the majority of guests are Belarusian, though owner Perakhod said he hoped in future that the bar would function as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a normal bar in Warsaw\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and attract a more varied clientele. Across town at Backdoor Bar, another Belarusian establishment, friendly staff hand out menus written in Belarusian but greet guests in Russian. Transplanted Minsk residents pointed out the different people at the tables: an opposition politician eating a burger, a youth activist drinking a beer, Minsk\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s best-known society photographer snapping pictures with one hand while holding a glass of white wine in the other. Levon Halatrian, one of the bar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owners, ran a bar in Minsk before the 2020 elections, when he joined the campaign team of opposition leader Viktor Babariko, who was jailed and barred from running in the August vote. Halatrian was also jailed after the protests, and spent some months in prison before being transferred to a labour camp. He arrived in Warsaw in January and opened Backdoor Bar in March, together with two others who ran a bar of the same name back in Minsk. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153About 80% of our guests are Belarusians, most of the rest are Ukrainians. Occasionally a lost British tourist will wander in, or sometimes even a Pole,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like it to be more like 50/50 - somewhere Poles want to come, but also a safe space for Belarusians, as we understand that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re probably here for a long time,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. Many Russian-speaking Ukrainians in Poland are learning Polish, and some are switching to speaking Ukrainian at home, a process also going on inside Ukraine since the outbreak of full-scale war. But for others, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to switch languages overnight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nobody has ever said anything aggressive to me, but of course it feels a bit uncomfortable to be speaking Russian given the history here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Maryna, a 37-year-old refugee from Zaporizhzhia, who arrived in Warsaw last spring and is now working as a manicurist in a salon that caters mainly for Ukrainian clients. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I try to speak basic Polish in shops, and at work I often speak Ukrainian, but most of my conversations with family and the friends I have here are in Russian, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not suddenly going to change my mother tongue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. While few Poles have any problems with hearing Russian spoken on the street, for some the presence of Russian-speaking Ukrainians prompts negative reactions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The war has killed the Russian language as a neutral language of communication,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Miros\u00c5\u201aaw Sk\u00c3\u00b3rka, president of the Union of Ukrainians in Poland. Sk\u00c3\u00b3rka said his organisation, which has helped coordinate support for Ukrainian refugees, had fielded numerous calls from Poles who had wanted to help but had been disturbed to find out the Ukrainians they were assisting continued to speak Russian. He pointed to an opinion poll in spring that showed attitudes among Poles towards Ukrainians in the country were gradually becoming less positive. One of the reasons given was that the majority of Ukrainians in Poland were speaking Russian, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nobody has a problem with Belarusians speaking Russian, but when it comes to Ukrainians, people wonder if it indicates a political preference. After some time passed, many people had a hard time understanding why they hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t learned either Ukrainian or Polish,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Sk\u00c3\u00b3rka. Adding to the mix of Russian speakers in Warsaw is a new cohort of immigrants from former Soviet countries in Central Asia, who receive Polish work permits to fill jobs such as taxi drivers or delivery couriers. Sulimjon, from Tajikistan, arrived in Warsaw in March and is working as an Uber driver in the city. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I spent three years in Moscow working in a kebab shop, but when I heard there was a possibility to come to Europe, I thought it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to be much better than being in Russia,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Sulimjon described how a web of contacts from post-Soviet countries helped him arrive and adapt in Warsaw: he flew to Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exclave of Kaliningrad, where he paid a middleman from Ukraine \u00e2\u201a\u00ac500 for advice on how to submit documents to the Polish consulate and receive a work visa. After arriving, he found a space in a hostel on the outskirts of Warsaw, where he shares a room with other Tajiks, as well as taxi drivers and couriers from Uzbekistan, Armenia and Georgia. The lingua franca among them is Russian. So far, he cannot speak more than a few words of Polish, but many of his clients are Ukrainians or Belarusians, with whom he can also speak in Russian. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Warsaw feels a bit like Moscow used to. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a mini Soviet Union, with all the different nationalities speaking to each other in Russian,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/11/alexander-soros-given-control-of-father-george-soros-multi-billion-foundation", "primaryCategory": "business", "title": "George Soros hands control of multi-billion foundation to son", "lead": "George Soros, 92, hands over reins of Open Society Foundations to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmore political\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 37-year-old", "author": "Mark Sweney", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T17:05:53Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764466", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d01cb28c898f598106839d655082b78016954fe6/0_88_3600_2161/500.jpg", "body": "The financier George Soros, the billionaire investor and liberal donor, has handed control of his multi-billion-dollar foundation to his son, Alexander.

Alexander, who studied history at New York University and earned a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, has pursued his own initiatives including backing progressive Jewish organisations, environmental causes and workers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights in the US. He also sits on the investment committee of the foundation that oversees Soros Fund Management (OSF), with the vast majority of the $25bn in assets under management belonging to the OSF.

Last June, 36-year-old Randy Cox was arrested on charges of illegal handgun possession and was put into a police transport van without any seatbelts. According to video footage released by Cox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family, Cox was being transported to a detention center when the officer driving the van, Oscar Diaz, braked suddenly, causing Cox to slide across the bench and hit his head against the van\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wall. Cox was left slumped at the back of the van for three minutes before Diaz stopped to check on him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t move. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to die like this. Please, please, please help me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Cox. He was eventually taken to the detention center where police officers ordered him to get up from the floor. When Cox said that he could not move, an officer replied: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not even trying.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Video footage showed Cox repeatedly slipping out of a wheelchair that officers placed him in, as well as a police officer saying \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He is perfectly fine\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as Cox lay on the floor of a cell. Following the incident, Cox filed a $100m federal civil lawsuit against the officers and the city of New Haven, alleging negligence, carelessness and excessive force against the officers involved. According to the lawsuit, Cox has been left with severe injuries and damages including a cervical spine fracture, permanent paralysis below his neck, permanent muscle atrophy and shortened life expectancy. The $45m settlement was reached on Friday evening and came two days after the city fired two police officers over their reckless treatment and lack of compassion towards Cox, the Associated Press reported. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mistakes have been well documented,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said a statement released by Cox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorneys, including prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But today is a moment to look to the future, so New Haven residents can have confidence in their city and their police department,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the statement added. Speaking to the AP, one of Cox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorneys, Louis Rubano, said that Cox \u00e2\u20ac\u0153kind of relived what happened to him throughout the day yesterday, so it was a very emotional day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwinding now,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rubano added.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a blast; see you three weeks tomorrow for Wimbledon! Peace out. So there we have it. The amazing, unfathomable, incomparable Novak Djokovic wins his third French Open and 23rd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ! \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Grand Slam trophy. He is unreal, and at 36 has plenty of time to extend the mark. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen anyone like him and we never will. He finishes by saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enjoying this very much, thanks \u00e2\u20ac\u0153football stars\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for being in the stadium \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ibra, Mbapp\u00c3\u00a9 and Tom Brady \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and what an honour it is to have them watch him, then tells the crowd he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see them next year and poses for photos. Djokovic is presented with a miniature trophy engraved with all the majors he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won, then picks up the big guy and begins in French. He thanks the crowd for a special atmosphere and is delighted to share this special moment in his career with them. This tournament has always been the hardest for him to win so he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very emotional at the moment and honoured to be here on this special day. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still looking for a French teacher so switches to English, thanking Ruud for his kind words and saying that everyone on tour respects, loves and appreciates him. In today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s world it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to point out when someone has the right human values, and Ruud ad his team have always been kind to Djokovic and his. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sorry for the result today but Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had an incredible couple of years in Paris and overall. He wishes him all the best always hopes he wins against anyone apart from him. He moves on to say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great honour to have Yannick Noah with him today, and though he was young when Noah retired, he loved watching videos of him and how he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s channelled his energy into music since then. He thanks his family and team for their patience and tolerance, saying he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been torturing them over the last few weeks and they know just how difficult he is. He thanks Mauresmo too, then addresses his kids saying he always tries to give them something to learn from, some inspiration. To all young people, whatever they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re pursuing, he was a seven-year-old dreaming of winning Wimbledon one day, had the power to create his own destiny, and he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just believe it but felt it with every fibre of his body. So he tells all young people to be in the present moment, forget about the past, and create the future. Djokovic has a special tracky top on, the number 23 embroidered on it. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit twee, of course it is, but in fairness to the lad, he has just won his 23rd Grand Slam trophy. Not bad. He raises the trophy aloft, kisses it, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve no idea how many he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll end on. 30ish? What a preposterous possibility.

He then thanks the crowd and his team, his parents, his partner, and has an amazing tan-line from his headband. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a long journey that started when he was a little boy and he hopes to make it back into another final. Ruud comes to collect his tray, runner-up for the second year in a row. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know there was nothing he could do. Tell you what, I know they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re always good, but these have been an especially good championships. I already feel bereft without them. Here comes the great Yannick Noah, champion 40 years ago, to present the trophy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Matt Dony is simply wrong, or ill-informed,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Mick Devine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBut can I prove objectively by watertight metrics that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbetter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than the other two?

ATP Finals, overlooked again by many, yet a tournament the ATP values at 1500 points\u00e2\u20ac\u201dadvantage Djokovic. Masters titles? Advantage, Djokovic. I know it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not sexy, the most pragmatic of the three winning on all counts. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just bonkers blessed to have lived through an era featuring these three athletes, Lebron and Steph, and Messi and Cristiano. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s enjoy the sunset.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t argue with any of this. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to get ever-more distant from here. As the ball dropped long, Djokovic went down in instalments, lying on the clay before celebrating with his team. He is impregnable and untouchable, sharing the moment with his daughter, wife and parents; I wonder if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re proud of him. Imagine how they feel; imagine how he feels. Every ounce of energy expended, the sacrifices and the pain, is for this moment and others like it; Djokovic returns to no1 in the world, and the calendar Grand Slam looks well within reach. He started slowly today but goodness me did he get going thereafter; Ruud played well, but not for one second did it look remotely feasible he could win. Djokovic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serving, especially down the T, and his forehand, especially cross-court, were terrifying in their awesomeness, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now won six of eight majors, his last 21 matches in majors, and every one of them thrice \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. at least. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never, ever, seen an athlete like him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the reliability that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most shocking, I think, able to hit with precision over and over again when under pressure or when cruising, each as baffling as the other. Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 6-5 Ruud* Djokovic shanks a forehand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes, you read that correctly, how absolutely date he, pathetic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then pauses for quiet before serving at 40-15. Here he goes, Ruud goes long, and there it is! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never seen anything like it! Novak Djokovic has done it! He has done it, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never, ever, see anything or anyone like him again! A freak of nature, physically and mentally, and he is not close to finished yet! *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 6-5 Ruud Ruud goes long on the forehand for 15-0, then nets a return for 30. Djokovic has made and is making this look so routine, winning 10 points on the spin and zetzing a serve down the middle that sets up a yet another booming forehand. Three championship points, three points to go out alone on 23 majors. What on earth are we seeing, people? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not the foggiest but please, drink it in, because whatever it is, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s never happening again. Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 6-5 Ruud* A backhand winner onto the line and Djokovic has 0-15, then Ruud swipes one just wide and , though he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s played the pressure-points well enough. this looks ominous. And, well, expletive! another sensational forehand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hitting these so, so well at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c howls from centre to sideline, and after acknowledging the crowd he punishes a backhand down the line for a love break, and that was a perfect game, a shocking exhibition of power and control, skill and thinking. I simply cannot believe how good he is and nor can you. In 90 seconds, Novak Djokovic will serve for his third French Open and 23rd Grand Slam singles title. History has its eyes on him! *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 5-5 Ruud You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just got to laugh. An ace, Djokovic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10th, begins the game, then a backhand slice falls wide for 30-0. Next, another ace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serving so well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a forehand from the forehand corner, lashed cross-court for yet another ludicrous winner, leaves Ruud shaking his head as he attempts to serve for a breaker \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at erast. Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 4-5 Ruud* Out of nowhere, Djokovic annihilates a forehand from centre that breaks the sideline \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ridiculous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but then he nets a drop and Ruud clouts a a winner from mid-court. But a mishit then sails long for 30-all and the pressure ratchets up only for a forehand to go long before a backhand zips fractionally wide. Djokovic will now serve to stay in the set. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 4-4 Ruud Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s struggled to make any impression on the Djokovic serve since set one, but the Serb nets a volley then a forehand and is something happening here? Er, probably not, a net-cord sending the ball clambering over it then an ace down the middle levelling things and another, right onto the T, securing the hold. Djokovic raises an arm to salute the crowd \u00e2\u20ac\u201cwell, to salute himself really \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 say he hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t earned the right. If he can break next up, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be serving for the championship and the record. Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 3-4 Ruud* Ruud punishes a backhand winner down the line then lands an ace on the T, the umpire overruling an out-call. Then, at 40-30, he pounds a forehand to the corner then cleans up with an overhead, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fighting well to stick in this match. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 3-3 Ruud Djokovic has yet to drop a point on serve in this set and at 15-0 he lands another ace on the T, then a service winner makes 40-15 and from there the game is quickly ended. Here comes the next breaking opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The H2H thing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd begins Gregory Phillips. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Not as fair a comparison as it might seem at first glance, since the peaks of Federer and Djokovic in particular didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t align. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also the presence of the other two that also served to make this era what it is. With no Nadal, for example, Federer would likely have half a dozen more slams. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a way to separate them, but if Djokovic was more likeable I doubt as many people would be disputing his GOAT status.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 2-3 Ruud* Another disgraceful forehand from Djokovic, again into that backhand corner, gets him 15-all, then as Ruud comes in at 40-30, he pastes a pass past him, flat and cross court on the forehand. Ruud, though, again hangs in there, making advantage and closing out with an ace. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As a Federer fan through and through,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd writes Yogesh P, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m reluctantly on board with the fact that he does not have the best shout at being the GOAT. The arguments for Djokovic are straightforward. The argument for Nadal is also quite compelling though. If there is one achievement of these big three that is least likely to be repeated in the future, it is Nadal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dominance of clay. Even the Grand Slam total can arguably be overcome in a weak competitive environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yes, and Nadal is better on clay than anyone else has been on any one surface \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not something I thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ever say when watching Sampras on grass \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good metric because there are other surfaces. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 2-2 Ruud It feels like every Djokovic service-game is staging post en route to another shot at getting Ruud broken; at 30-0, he mashes a forehand winner, but his opponent needs to start going for stuff because his current tactics aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working. Djokovic then sticks a pair of forehands into the backhand corner, the second a winner, and he is all over this match. Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 1-2 Ruud* Ruud hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given up, making 30-0 with a stretch volley and drive forehand. Djokovic, though, lands a deep backhand then despatches a very nice overhead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he seems to have rediscovered the ability to play that shot \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then a backhand return is too good after which a forehand winner down the line raises break point. But then another backhand is swallowed by the net \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Djokovic is less than gruntled \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and from there, Ruud hangs on for an admirable hold. The Serb is, though, in nearly every one of his service games now, and you assume that at some point, one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be confiscated. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 1-1 Ruud Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of a few players \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Berrettini and Tistsipas are others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who I can see making loads of major finals without winning any. It just feels that when it comes to it, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll always face a better player able to take advantage of their relatively weak backhands, though I guess Berrettini at least has that serve. Anyhow, another easy hold for Djokovic, who looks impregnable currently. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Allow me a word for Andy Murray, please,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd offers Simon McMahon. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For him to even be mentioned in the same breath as Federer, Djokovic and Nadal is testament to his greatness, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d argue. Maybe not statistically (though he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about to win again on grass in the UK), but as you rightly point out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not all about simply doing the math. Greatness can be measured in many ways. If I could have one sporting wish for this year, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that Murray somehow makes the Wimbledon final\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I love Murray, and his three majors are worth more than, say, Jim Courier\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s four, and you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beat sportsfolk who stand for things, especially when those things are decency and integrity. Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 0-1 Ruud* Ruud knows the jig is bust, and a brace of backhands earn Djokovic 15-30. He does well to retort with an ace, though, only his second of the match, and closes out from there. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Essentially, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a perishingly fine line between greatest and favourite,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reckons Matt Dony. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A compelling case could probably be made for Federer, Nadal or Djokovic to be the greatest player, but it almost doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter. The three of them have all obliterated records, destroyed all-comers, and set new standards. I will always love Federer, and I want him to be the greatest. But can I prove objectively by watertight metrics that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbetter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 than the other two? No. And likewise for the fans of the other two. The important thing is, between them, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve brought joy to pretty much ALL tennis fans. We can, however, definitely agree on specific strengths that they all enjoy. Now, any elite sportsperson has mental strength, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think of many individuals in any sport who have shown greater focus, determination, cold-blooded will-to-win than Djokovic. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t particularly like him (for a great number of reasons) but I espect the hell out of him. Even when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a set or two down, you never expect him to lose. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s astonishing. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll probably win today, and he deserves to. He is, inarguably, one of the greatest. Not just tennis players. One of the greatest competitors. One of the greatest sportspeople.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd *Djokovic 7-6(1) 6-3 Ruud Ruud goes long for 15-0 then Djokovic conjures a lovely angle to go from backhand corner to sideline, via forehand; he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two points away. Another decent forehand then entices Ruud to slice into the net, and when a return drops short, a backhand down the line seals the set. Novak Djokovic is a set away from becoming the most successful singles player in the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good at tennis, I reckon. Djokovic 7-6(1) 5-3 Ruud* Djokovic whooshes a forehand onto the line and Ruud can retort, netting then clumping wide from mid-court with plenty of space to hit. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a dreadful shot at a dreadful moment, and another terrific return helps bring about another error; two set points. Ruud, though, saves both, the second with a fantastic leaping forehand winner that breaks the sideline, rishes through deuce and Djokovic will have to serve for it. I fear he shall cope. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Responding to Bruce Millar,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd begins Jonathan Wallach, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be the GOAT if you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the best of your own generation. Djokovic has a winning H2H against Federer as does Nadal. We know who was better when they played each other. Aesthetics are nonsense and a red herring for people who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t accept the truth.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd *Djokovic 7-6(1) 5-2 Ruud Ruud does well at the net, approaching with a forehand to the corner then eventually guiding a volley into an empty space. Then coming in again, a succession of telling volleys leads to Djokovic netting, and at 15-30 he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a sniff. But an overhit backhand ruins his lead then a dumped slice raises game point, and when Ruud has a high-bouncing ball to strike from the baseline, he nets. Djokovic 7-6(1) 4-2 Ruud* A mishit forehand pass onto the line gives Ruud 30-15, a service winner takes him to within a point of the match, and when Djokovic goes long, he narrows the gap again. The thing about Novak (and Nadal in his pomp) is once they break back and settle into the match you just expect them to play the big points better\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd returns James Wilson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Six tiebreaks won out of six for Novak in this tournament and its not like Ruud did a whole lot wrong in that first set. I guess that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the one thing it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s impossible to teach - the killer instinct comes out for the generational talents or goats and they always play their best on those points. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why they win so much and so often. Ruud is playing about as well as he can and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excellent on clay yet every big point since the middle of the first set Novak has won. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no accident.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I agree and this is why I think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the greatest. His consistency is like nothing I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen before, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d feel most comfortable with him playing to save me from death. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 4-1 Ruud An ace down the middle, his seventh, gives Djokovic 30-0, but a forehand into the net gives Ruud a sniff. A very light sniff. A forehand winner then totally surprises him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not in the corner or close, the ball passing not too far from his body \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is enough for 40-15 only for a double, Djokovic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first of the match, to keep it close. But Ruud then returns long and the second set looks like it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll soon be over. Djokovic 7-6(1) 3-1 Ruud* Djokovic whips a forehand winner cross-court for 15-all, Ruud frozen by the devastating brilliance of it. But he then misses fractionally with another, nets, sends a return long, and the Norwegian is on the board in set two. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 3-0 Ruud Djokovic consolidates to 15 and looks every inch like a man about to win a record 23rd major. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe Nadal peaked early (2010?), \u00e2\u20ac\u0153 begins Kevin Simons, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but he won two majors as recently as last year, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s less than a year older than Djokovic. Any talk that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been unfortunate to fall between generations is nonsense. He has a losing record to Joker, hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t beaten him on grass in over a decade, and hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t taken a single set off him on a hard court since the 2013 US Open. The only reason their head to head is even close is because they have played a disproportionate number of matches, 29, on clay. Forget it. Joker is the GOAT.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Djokovic 7-6(1) 2-0 Ruud* Trouble for Ruud who finds himself down 0-30 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Djokovic is starting to hum \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and though a forehand into the corner halves the arrears, a fine forehand returns raises two break points. And Ruud saves both, Djokovic getting really close on the second with a forehand that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fractionally wide \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only for the Serb to finally nail an overhead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c set up by another decent return \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that gives him advantage. Ruud is struggling to land first serves now and he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t here, but he does get to deuce. So Djokovic finds another fine return then directs his man to hither and yon before cleaning up, and a sliced backhand yanks Ruud to the net, a lob forces him away from it, and a drop is too good. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the break and this match is only going one way. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At risk of prolonging an endless and futile argument,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd begins Bruce Millar, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Roger Federer is clearly the GOAT, for two reasons: 1. There is nothing to choose between F/N/D on overall stats, with 82/3% pro wins. But Fed has won significantly more Wimbledons and US Opens that the others (go and count them). Paris is a specialist surface (and btw they endlessly tweaked Wimbledon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grass to make it more accommodating for Nadal et al), and Melbourne just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so important (I write this as a proud half-Aussie). 2. Greatness in anything has to be measured in more than maths. There is an aesthetic component, too, and Fed wins on this measure by a double bagel. I think that concludes the debate.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As per below, I agree that greatness is measured in more than maths. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also measured in more than maths and aesthetics, so I totally understand why and if some people prefer Nadal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s muscular indefatigability to Federer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grace. *Djokovic 7-6(1) 1-0 Ruud Ruud must start this set well, but having slogged for 81 minutes and received the cube root of nowt as a reward, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easier said than done. Djokovic holds to love and is 76% on first serves in, 73% on points won when that happens. This next game is a biggun. Off we go again. Obviously Djokovic nips out, and Ruud does too. A backhand winner does the trick, and that was just fantastic. Djokovic is still to err in a breaker this tournament, and Ruud is in trouble \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t play much better than that against this opponent, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done him no good whatsoever. Djokovic 6-6 Ruud (6-1) Further impeccable behaviour from Djokovic gives him five set points\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Djokovic 6-6 Ruud (4-1) And he we go again, Djokovic sent out wide after a mahoosive forehand cross, stretching to send a glooooorious winner down the line for the mini-break. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how many strokes were played in that rally but it was plenty, then at the end of another epic, he wins a net exchange, and though Ruud holds his two serves, Djokovic is in pretty decent control here. *Djokovic 6-6 Ruud Excellent from Ruud at 15-0, pushing Djokovic back with a backhand then punishing a winner down the line off the same flank. So an ace down the T follows, then a big forehand winner, and very soon after that we go into a breaker. Djokovic has won all five he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s played in this competition and in the process has yet to make an unforced error., No, that is not a misprint. Djokovic 5-6 Ruud* Ruud nets a forehand unnecessarily and might that be a critical oversight? Er, no. At 15-all Djokovic shouts about a bounce he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like, at 30-15 a forehand onto the line makes a clean winner, and while the Serb spends change of ends bitching at the umpire for hurrying him to serve, Ruud prepares to try and break for the set. *Djokovic 5-5 Ruud A massive forehand an a luscious backhand lob give Ruud 0-15 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three points away from the set \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and have an absolute look! Djokovic is in control of the next rally, playing a lob, but Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s riposte, via tweener is exceptional, Djokovic spurns an overhead putaway, and then slips to take Ruud closer. That was a phenomenal rally and the set\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already been going 63 minutes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nor is it finished yet, Djokovic getting a little lucky on 30-all when Ruud botches a tame second serve directed at his forehand. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not loving the sun at his current end, but he does close out and on we go. This is maturing into a really fun contest. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Casper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great guy, lovely sweatband styling, good player, all that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd emails Jeremy Boyce. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we all know that a fit and in-form ruthless serial killer Major title-winner is going to blow all that Norwegian charm and lovely strokes out of the fjord. Casper started good and fast, but the assassin of younger title hopefuls will hunt him down...\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Djokovic 4-5 Ruud* Has the match shifted? Djokovic gets to 0-30, dictates the next point with his forehand \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and then makes a mess of a forehand down the line. An ace follows, then another brutal rally, ended when Ruud sticks an impatient backhand into the net \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s starting to lose the longuns now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that weaker flank is being targeted. But pinned into the corner, as soon as he gets to play off his fore he prompts the error that makes deuce \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Djokovic bends, hands on knees, to catch his breath \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Ruud makes advantage as his opponent slips, though the point was already gone. From there, Ruud closes out, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a monumental hold. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My two pence in response to the seeming obsession to proclaim Djokovic as the undisputed GOAT,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Guillaume Emualliug. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nadal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire career has played out in the overlap between peak Federer and peak Djokovic. And during that period he won more grand slams than either. Meanwhile Federer won a bunch of slams against the likes of Hewitt and Roddick, and Djokovic has the opportunity now to win with neither Fed nor Nadal any longer on the scene. Nadal is the GOAT!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I agree who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beaten who is persuasive, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not conclusive. All three of the players you mention have won enough majors against each other for us to know they can do it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not, say, penalising Federer, because he got to play, say, Philippoussis. *Djokovic 4-4 Ruud A terrific forehand down the line, flat with the new balls, allows Ruud to disburse a nice volley at net; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really impressed by how confidently he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attacking this match. Then, at 15-all, three shrieking forehands force Djokovic to yield \u00e2\u20ac\u201c eventually \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this contest does not look like how I expected it to, at all, and as I type a deep backhand facilitates a cunning drop and with comes break point. So another sapping, compelling rally ensues, Djokovic taking no chance on an overhead, doing straight down the middle, before putting away a much harder angled volley for deuce. From there, Djokovic closes out, and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three games on the bounce for him. Djokovic 3-4 Ruud* Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forehand has been the defining shot of this set and it takes him to 15-0 only for an errant backhand to hand Djokovic parity. Ans when he loses a corner-to-corner rally, pinned on that same backhand, another oversight puts him under pressure. But what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this?! Djokovic misses a second overhead for two break points \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I can barely believe what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m seeing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c except a poor forehand hands him one, he does ridiculously to stay in a ridiculous 28-stroke rally\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 then Ruud dumps an overhead of his own! Djokovic salutes the crowd, and that might be the key momentum shift \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a very stupid thing to say at this stage of a final, but then we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about a player of stupid brilliance. *Djokovic 2-4 Ruud Djokovic is playing better now, starting to dictate points in the manner to which he and we have become accustomed. He holds to 15 but Ruud, who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s yet to take a set off him losing 2-0 in all four previous meeting, only needs tow of his own to move in front. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Call it a naive argument but the number of tournaments on the hardcourts give Novak too much of an edge. Or any HC player to be honest. Tennis really needs to be spread across surfaces evenly. The metrics we use to measure greatness are a bit shallow.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As I said at the top, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just count stuff. But if I had to pick someone to play for my life on an unspecified surface \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seems unlikely but you never know \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even have to think about who I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going for. Djokovic 1-4 Ruud* Djokovic does indeed look for winners, but he needs Ruud to thrash wide to get a point at 30-15. Then, having worked the Norwegian from side to side, he misses his attempted backhand winner down the line and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re told that of rallies to go beyond five shots, Ruud has won 14/17. And he secures another hold via high-kicking body-serve that facilitates a forehand winner and celebrates with gusto. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll love the start he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made and rightly so, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing nicely. *Djokovic 1-3 Ruud It just seems so unlikely that a meticulous beast like Djokovic wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mentally ready for the start of this match, but he knows he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in one now and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect a pretty swift uptick in performance. He holds to love, getting himself on the board, and is landing 85% of his first deliveries. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect him to have a proper go art Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s serve now. Djokovic 0-3 Ruud* Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s made a good start and looks confident, but he misses a simple putaway to find himself facing 15-30. Two straight points, though, take him close to a consolidation \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only for him send down a double. No matter, he quickly closes out, his advantage earned thanks a fine backhand down the line backed up by a forehand winner. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Impossible really to argue that Djokovic is not the GOAT\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Peter McLeod. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I resisted for years, but like he did to so many opponents, he wore me down. Beating Nadal at the French is what confirmed it for me, but there were signs from early on that he was gonna do it. That return from match point down against Federer in the 2011 US final. The six hours against Nadal at the 2012 Aussie. Maybe the most painful for those not of a Djokovic persuasion was Wimbledon 2019. Admittedly at risk of sour grapes, but: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little hard to separate the art from the artist isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it? The way he seemed to get a bit injured every time he was in trouble against Murray, before springing back to life. The antivax stuff. The hints of Serbian nationalism. Maybe that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just me; none of Roger, Rafa or Andy seem to have beef with him.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t argue with any of that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not always easy to love, and his efforts to change that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always recognise how love is earned. *Djokovic 0-2 Ruud Djokovic hits such ridiculous lengths with his groundstrokes, but at 15-0 he slaps a forehand into the net \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so sends down a monstrous serve to right the cosmic balance of things. But what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this?! He spanks a forehand wide having won the chance to hit a winner, then nets, and Ruud has a break point! Not for long, taking control of the rally with a booming forehand that eventually incites an error \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but again he goes wide on the forehand, so again, a chance for 2-0. Ahahahaha, a kicking serve out wide then a hellacious forehand winner down the line make deuce, but following an ace Djokovic nets. So we go backwards and forwards, a succession of game points spurned and saved \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one with a gorgeous inside-out backhand return \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then a forehand return persuades Djokovic to overhit, and under a lob at the net, he makes a total mess of what looks a straightforward overheard, bungling long, and Rudd in in charge! Djokovic 0-1 Ruud* (denotes server) I guess Ruud blew Zverev off the court on Friday, and though that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a far easier task than the one he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about to attempt, it tells us he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s playing well. Djokovic, though, started like a train against Alcaraz, and if he can find similar form now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the one hand, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a final, on the other he might not be as excited by the matchup \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see how this is close. But as I type that, Ruud whips through a love hold although, on the down side, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve just noticed his awful trainers. Here we go, Ruud to serve. The roof is open, but with rain forecast for later it might not stay that way. Anyone else think Ruud looks like a McGann? Djokovic gets a proper roar, so here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an absolutely mind-boggling Djokovic stat: of his last 21 major semis, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won 20 of them. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an outrage. Here come our players! Ruud says it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not easy to be relaxed. There are only four Sundays on which major finals are played, one of them is today, and being involves is far from a given. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s excited, as you would be. Email! \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m back!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd begins James Wilson. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Novak in three, max four sets (with Ruud maybe snagging the third 7-6 or 6-4). I am a Federer fan but I think the numbers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lie around Djokovic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c greatest male tennis player by miles and it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even close. Sure, he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pass the eye test (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I prefer watching the ethereal Federer play) but if you wanted a man to play for your life, and you could choose just one tennis player, one, who would stay there three hours orv three days but get the job done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you would only pick one player \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Novak (Fed would shank too many backhands and Nadal is too injury-prone). The chat around Novak being too mechanical is understandable but it mostly belongs to casual fans (which is the majority, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face it) who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really understand just how remarkable it is what he is doing. To outlast, physically, a man 16 years his junior on the clay and in the heat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is testament to the intensity of the man, his supreme fitness and conditioning and simply knowing his body, and playing well within himself, never mind stumbling over the five rounds up to the semis, where he simply goes up several gears and Carlos simply could not keep up, once this happened. He is not used to being challenged. To every single point he plays having such intensity, so much running, so many angles, for his serve, a massively improved stroke the last year or so, or how he returns, with insane precision, every single time. There are no easy points facing Djokovic in a best-of-five format \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he gives you nothing. He can also raise his level at any point he wants to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Carlos was playing as well as he possibly can for two sets but the price his body paid for it was visible at 1-1 in the third set. Novak? You always felt that he could be out there another three hours, no problem, playing with a level as high, if not higher, if and when he needed to. And we have a situation that outside the US Open nobody born after the year 1987 has won a slam. Novak, Rafa, Fed and Andy, been so dominant that two generations of tennis players have been and gone, and even Alcaraz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s generation have no idea what it is to win a Slam and beat the best of the best in order to do so \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Novak has simply refused to age, and Rafa before him - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been so dominant, for so long, that they are 3-0 up in the first set before they even step on to the court in matches other than with each other. Carlos admitted yesterday that he was nervous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he was visibly frustrated to see throwing the kitchen sink at Novak \u00e2\u20ac\u201c only (per Roddick\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s famous quote) to have him come back with the bathtub. Everything comes up \u00e2\u20ac\u201c precise, deep, kisses the baseline. No free points. For a guy with seemingly no weaknesses, Carlos maybe has this one (as do all the players of his vintage) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first 30 mins of the first set against Novak or Rafa they play entirely in their head \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before any serves, forehands or backhands are hit. And THAT is Djokovic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatness (and Rafa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s before them). He is about to win every Slam at least three times (he has already won them all, together with Rafa, at least twice). Even with their slams being 22 apiece, Rafa simply has never been that durable \u00e2\u20ac\u201c his weeks at number 1 are negligible \u00e2\u20ac\u201c while Novak has been there longer than any man or woman, ever, since records began. And having reached at least seven finals at each of the four slams, it is only fitting that he should win them all, more often, than any man, in the Open era.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I agree with most of this. I too don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s especially close, but I do think Djokovic looked to be tiring when Alcaraz did, and I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think he was necessarily going to win. But his ability to handle pressure and intensity told; Alcaraz wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t prepared for that because how could he be? Trying to find reasons Ruud might win, Mats clutches at the US Open final \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Djokovic lost to Medvedev in straights trying to complete the calendar Grand Slam. But even if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an almighty choke, I doubt Ruud has the weapons to take advantage over five \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just serve well and win 4, 4 and 4. More generally, though, what a fortnight this has been. In particular, I buzzed off Karol\u00c3\u00adna Muchov\u00c3\u00a1, who I hope has announced herself as a serious force in the women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s game. Her mix of power and guile looks built to last, in every city, in every nation from Lake Geneva to the Finland station and her match against Aryna Sabalenka was the best of the competition, for 24 hours, because Djokovic v Carlos Alcaraz was, until what happened happened, the best sporting contest I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen this year. If I continue this post any longer, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll start looking forward to Wimbledon, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to end it and stay in the moment, because what a moment it is: either history or shock awaits us. Asked to weigh-in on the goat debate, Mac equivocates, saying Nadal is best on clay, Federer grass and Djokovic hard. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re asking me to pick one, though, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going Djokovic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c much as Nadal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forehand might be the greatest shot ever and the beauty of watching Federer makes my soul sing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c because all-round, I think he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardest to beat with fewest weaknesses. So, what can Ruud do to win? Happily, Calvin Betton, our resident coach, messages in with yet more wisdom for me to pass off as my own: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re basically the same player but Novak is 20 times better at it. They both make loads of balls. Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s career is absolutely mental. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s won quite a few 250s, and has 3 slam finals now. And other than that he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s barely won a match in a 500, Masters 1000 or a Slam \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been top five in the world for two years now. He gets unbelievably lucky with draws, has a terrible record against other top-10 players, and to beat Djokovic you have to be consistent and hit through him, which Ruud can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. You look at the guys that have beaten him in big matches - Thiem, Del Po, Federer, Nadal, Wawrinka. They do it by hitting through him. Only Murray has beat him at his own game.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Greatness in sport is easy to detect but difficult to measure. Obviously there are numbers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 22 Grand Slams, say, or 387 weeks as world No 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but love is about feelings not statistics, and sport is so closely aligned with love the two are almost indivisible. If Novak Djokovic wins today, he becomes the most successful men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tenniser ever, out on his own on 23 majors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c three ahead of Roger Federer, one ahead of Rafael Nadal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the first to win each title thrice. Thrice! But to reduce him to those digits is to miss the experience of watching one of the most freakish athletes, competitors and intellects the world has ever seen. Physically, Djokovic is perfect, a lean, honed, absolute specimen made of elasticated girders covered in purple velvet, but mentally he is even better. His relentless dedication to tennis \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to himself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is both affirming and terrifying, his refusal to be beaten as inspirational as his desperation to win, and his ability to do the right thing, over and over and over again, is like nothing we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen before. He is a genius of geometry and of spirit, a triumph of the human capacity for self-realisation and self-actualisation, and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nowhere near finished. All of which adds up a tricky afternoon for Casper Ruud, who has no obvious path to victory. He does more or less what Djokovic does, just significantly less well, lacking a great weapon, unusual feel or top level that, if they click, can override what reality tells us is inevitable. But one reason we love this thing of ours is that once people start doing stuff, all sorts of other stuff can happen, and Ruud, playing his second consecutive Roland-Garros final and third Slam final in a year, will have convinced himself he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ready to shock the world. Whatever happens from here, this is going to be epochal.

He always has been, but he continues to be my favourite.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sure the Australia captain, Pat Cummins, might have displayed some confusion about time and continuity. But his sentiment was what mattered, after another decisive bowling burst from the Victorian quick opened up Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s path to victory against India in the World Test Championship final. It is difficult for anyone not to feel some affection for Boland, unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re especially invested in a team he is opposing. Partly it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that could be me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd factor. You have a player who was ignored by Test selectors until the age of 32. Undemonstrative by nature, free of glamour in appearance or in cricketing style. A state-team bowler who pounded in with a heavy tread to bowl on a length at a moderate pace, toiling in the middle of grand cricket grounds in front of almost nobody. And of course \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that could be me\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is a fallacy, because nobody else spent those years like Boland honing their craft, but the idea that a complete unknown could walk into elite sport and excel is a lot of fun. Anyone can get a kick out of imagining themselves in that spot. Boland was largely unknown when he arrived and excelled, taking six wickets in 19 balls against England in the Boxing Day Test of 2021. Even more compelling was that his six for seven in the second innings came after far more workmanlike figures of one for 48 in the first. He had played a few limited\u00e2\u20ac\u2018overs matches for Australia five years earlier but that had been it. So the perception of an honest trier having his day in the sun appealed to people. Implicit in the affectionate response was also the perception that it was a fluke, that he would drop back behind Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proper quicks once all were fit, and that if not he would soon be sorted out by players operating at a level above his. Instead, the wicket burst has become the Boland signature. Undroppable after Melbourne for his second Test in Sydney, he had sequences of two wickets in eight balls, then two in three balls. To finish the Ashes in Hobart he took three in 21 balls. He waited nearly a year for his next match, then took three wickets in an over against West Indies. Against South Africa in Brisbane it was again two in three balls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in both innings. So it was on form in this final when Boland dismissed Virat Kohli and Ravindra Jadeja in three balls, and almost made it three in four when KS Bharat frantically gloved a bumper over first slip. His setup used immaculate control over 12 balls, making Kohli hang back for inward movement, before one fuller drew him into a drive \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not full enough, leaving room to seam away. Then around the wicket to Jadeja, inward movement leaving the left-hander. It was still only Boland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eighth Test, but that makes eight of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s last 18, and most he has missed have been in Asia with two or three spinners. Across those matches, the Boland multiple strike has proved not to be a fluke, but a knack. This is the most astonishing part of the equation. Boland was first picked because he had spent 10 years bowling on a Melbourne Cricket Ground surface that could only be woken with a kiss from a prince. His seasons for Victoria generally required between nine and 14 overs per wicket. Endurance and perseverance without assistance were his offering. In this sense, coming up a level has made his job easier. Test pitches have been comparatively lively in recent years, and access to them means that Boland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weapons are more powerful. The precision with which he delivers the seam, and the force he uses to bang it into the pitch, give him the lavish sideways movement that does such damage. Pace in the surface makes his short ball unexpectedly nasty. And on any surface, he has his old tools of accuracy and consistency. Boland is now 34, but sports science has moved the window for cricketers later. First it was the idea of batters peaking in their 30s, then spinners, now older fast bowlers are common. Access to dedicated support as an international must have helped his fitness. Boland seems to improve through a match, rather than tire. His first-innings returns are a respectable 11 wickets at 27, but in the second innings he has 22 wickets at 8.18. Starting the previous Australian summer, Boland was behind the Big Three: Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood. By now, although injuries again gave him his chance, perhaps the Big Three are not the Big Three any more. Perhaps he wins a start in his own right. The Scott Boland story stood out for its impossibility, but with each performance it looks more possible."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/11/south-africa-may-seek-way-out-of-hosting-brics-summit-over-putin-arrest", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "South Africa may seek way out of hosting Brics summit over Putin arrest", "lead": "Pretoria would be required to arrest Putin if he attended and send him to The Hague for trial on war crimes charges", "author": "Patrick Wintour Diplomatic editor", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T16:48:24Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764478", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/751d2a504b3851e0541fec1db574b1ca014bf5c2/0_24_3600_2160/500.jpg", "body": "South Africa may abandon its role as host of this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Brics summit in an attempt to avoid international pressure to arrest the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who is wanted by the international criminal court on charges of war crimes. In a flurry of diplomatic activity around Ukraine, South Africa with five other African states is trying to garner support for a new peace plan. South Africa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, on Saturday briefed Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, on the upcoming visit by African leaders to Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to end hostilities. China has its own peace mission under way, and it is not clear what the Africa mission might add. Ramaphosa has recruited Zambia, Senegal, Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Egypt to join his peace delegation. As a party to the Rome statute, the treaty underpinning the court, Pretoria would be required to arrest Putin and then send him to The Hague for trial. But China and India, if they hosted the summit, would not face the same obligation, leading some South African officials to suggest handing the summit to Beijing. Brazil, the fifth member of Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) is also a party to the court, so faces the same dilemma as South Africa. Ukraine hopes to capitalise on the proliferation of peace plans emerging from the global south by staging a peace conference in July, possibly in Denmark, at which it would set out its terms for a settlement to the conflict. The aspiration is that by then Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s counteroffensive would have changed the dynamic of the war, and Kyiv hopes the global south will realise that Russia needs to leave Ukraine to avoid further bloodshed. The Danish foreign minister, Lars L\u00c3\u00b8kke Rasmussen, has already said he is willing to host such an event. The Ukrainian president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, said he would speak on Sunday to the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, about a dinner Duda intends to attend on Monday with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, focused on Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bid for Nato membership at a summit in Vilnius in July. The three leaders are expected to discuss the postwar security guarantees that can be offered to Ukraine, and how specific a route map to Nato membership can be offered. Zelenskiy said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hope that our colleagues are thinking about how to speed up Ukraine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accession to Nato. Or not. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an unprecedented speech in Bratislava this month, Macron not only held out an olive branch to eastern European states he has criticised in the past, including Poland, but proposed guarantees to Ukraine that match those provided by the US to Israel. The guarantees would not necessarily be provided by Nato itself but by Nato member states. He said Ukraine warranted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strong, concrete and tangible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd security guarantees and argued that it should be offered \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a path towards membership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, Scholz struck a different tone, saying last Thursday that the focus should not be on Nato membership. He said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is also clear that we will have to discuss what security guarantees can be provided in the postwar situation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The exact nature of the offer that could be made to Ukraine is complicated by the fact that when the Nato members meet, the context may have changed depending on perceptions of the state of the counteroffensive currently under way. Ukraine could not be offered Nato membership while at war with Russia since that would require the alliance taking on a commitment to go to war with Moscow. US envoy to Nato, Juliette Smith, told Politico last week: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the allies now are in agreement that a proper invitation is unlikely while they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re engaged in a full-scale war.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd At the same time, the fear is that if the Vilnius summit sends out a weak signal to Ukraine, that may encourage Putin to believe western support is wavering and that he could ultimately win the war or at least achieve a frozen conflict.

At a time when the prime minister is trying to prove that he has steadied the ship, Conservative HQ is likely to see them as sapping time and attention. For Labour and the Liberal Democrats, they are a chance to get on the front foot before the next general election. So, where are the byelections happening, and what are the opposition parties\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 chances? Uxbridge and South Ruislip Outgoing MP: Boris Johnson Majority: 7,210 Target: Labour The Tories have held Uxbridge and South Ruislip, a suburban seat on the outer reaches of west London, since its creation in 2010. Johnson won there with a majority of 10,695 in 2015, 5,034 in 2017 and 7,210 in 2019. Polling by the former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft suggested early last week that Johnson would win a byelection with 50% of the vote, with Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Danny Beales on 33% and the Liberal Democrat Blaise Baquiche on 6%, a point ahead of the Greens. With Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to stand down on Friday, however, Labour has the seat firmly in its sights and it is seen as a key target. Even before Johnson quit it was among Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top 100 targets. The Ashcroft poll has also been questioned; modelling from Britain Predicts puts Labour on course to win the seat by 11 points. Beales is currently a council cabinet member in Camden, but he was born in Hillingdon hospital and grew up in South Ruislip and Ruislip Manor. Labour hope the 34-year-old charity worker will appeal to the constituency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voters. Baquiche, a former civil servant and media consultant on the climate and the environment, will contest the seat for the Lib Dems. The party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Ed Davey has ruled out a formal pact with Labour to encourage tactical voting in order to beat the Conservatives in the byelections. The seat has a very diverse, mainly South Asian population. The white British share of its population has fallen from 57 to 36% in the past 11 years. The Conservatives retained control of Hillingdon, which forms part of the constituency, in the 2022 local elections. But according to analysis in the New Statesman by the co-founder of the polling group Britain Elects, the seat is winnable for Labour - and is seen as a bellwether for the next general election. The polling expert Luke Tryl from More in Common has also said Labour should be able to win in Uxbridge, unless there is something \u00e2\u20ac\u0153seriously off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the polling. Mid Bedfordshire Outgoing MP: Nadine Dorries Majority: 24,664 Target: Liberal Democrats, Labour At first glance, Mid Bedfordshire seems as close to a typical Tory rural heartland as you could imagine. It has long been considered an ultra-safe seat and has been in Conservative hands since 1931. It voted strongly to leave the EU in 2016, and the Tories have a sizeable majority of 24,664. After Dorries resigned on Friday, however, having reportedly been dropped from Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resignation honours list, Labour and the Lib Dems have stepped up their manoeuvres in the constituency, where a byelection is likely to be fought in the autumn. The former culture secretary won 60% of the vote at the 2019 general election, with Labour on 22% and the Lib Dems on 13%. The seat consists of small towns and rural areas, and is wealthier than the UK average. Despite the 2019 result, the Lib Dems insist that, given that it is a solid Tory seat in the south of England, they are the main challengers, pointing to successes in previous contests in Tory-dominated rural areas. The Lib Dems would need a 23.6% swing to win the seat, smaller than the 25.2% they achieved in Chesham and Amersham in June 2021 and the 34.2% that won them North Shropshire last December. Sources in the party have been quoted as saying that Labour has a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153natural ceiling\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in rural Tory heartlands, and they point to the fact that the seat stayed blue in the Labour landslide of 1997. But Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign chief, Shabana Mahmood, has said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour will be campaigning to win in this byelection by listening to the voters the Tories are ignoring.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd According to UK Polling Report, the seat could well stay in Tory hands. The pollster Callum Jones said that while a Conservative loss in Mid Bedfordshire is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153more than possible\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may well depend on how well opposition parties can cooperate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Selby and Ainsty Outgoing MP: Nigel Adams Majority: 20,137 Target: Labour/Liberal Democrats With a Conservative majority of 20,137 in 2019, Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire is hardly marginal. It has been in Tory hands since its creation in 2010, and Nigel Adams has successfully defended the seat three times. But the Johnson loyalist, who quit with immediate effect on Saturday after also reportedly being promised a peerage that did not materialise, has left the party wide open to a Labour attack. The Tories took 60% of the vote in 2019, Labour 25% and the Lib Dems 8.6%. Britain Elects polling suggests a narrow Tory win, with the Conservatives on 40.5% and Labour on 38.5%. The seat has not always been true blue. Before 2010, the Selby seat went the way of the governing party at every election from its creation in 1983, and was a Labour marginal with decreasing majorities during the Blair and Brown years until it switched in 2010. A mainly rural constituency, which includes the towns of Selby and Tadcaster, its inhabitants have an income close to the national average and with lower than average reliance on social housing. Tryl said that while the seat was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153solid\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the Tories, the mood of its voters could show if \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Labour is on course to win [in similar fashion to] 1997 or somewhere short of that mark\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 This article was amended on 12 June 2023 to remove a sentence quoting Rhiannon Meades as Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s candidate for the Mid Bedfordshire byelection. The quote was from Meades\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 campaign there in 2019; she is not standing in the upcoming byelection. It was also amended to clarify that the Hillingdon local elections were in 2022, not this year."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/11/novak-djokovic-casper-ruud-french-open-23-grand-slam-titles-tennis", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Novak Djokovic reaches record 23 grand slam titles after French Open final win", "lead": "Novak Djokovic beat Casper Ruud 7-6, 6-3, 7-5 at Roland Garros to move one ahead of Rafael Nadal in male grand slam titles", "author": "Tumaini Carayol at Roland Garros", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T16:24:56Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764482", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/63783bbcee23ccb517f5e87dbeb8bb5431fcc9c1/0_187_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "Since his emergence at the top level of professional tennis 18 years ago, Novak Djokovic has used the dizzying bar set by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal before him as inspiration to push himself to his limits, never doubting that he would one day rise above it. What once seemed impossible eventually became inevitable. On Sunday, Djokovic finally surpassed his great rivals in the most significant category of all as he defeated Casper Ruud 7-6 (1), 6-3, 7-5 to clinch his 23rd grand slam title, breaking his tie of 22 with Nadal. This historic victory means that Djokovic is now the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sole grand slam record holder, alongside countless other records. After years of being blocked by Nadal, the greatest claycourter of all time, at the French Open, Djokovic also now has three titles in Paris and he is the first man to win each grand slam tournament three times. He will also return to No 1 for a record-extending 388th week as the best player in the world. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every single player dreams of being on this stage and winning the trophy at least once in their career. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m beyond fortunate in my life to win 23 times, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an incredible feeling,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Djokovic said during his on-court speech. While he still covers the court with more flexibility and ease than most athletes at their physical peak, these achievements at his age have only added another layer to his greatness. Djokovic is now the oldest Roland Garros singles champion in history at 36 years and 20 days. He has also won the last three grand slam tournaments he has contested \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he did not travel to the US Open last year due to the United States banning unvaccinated visitors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c compiling a 21\u00e2\u20ac\u2018match grand slam winning run. Few people gave Ruud, the fourth seed, much of a realistic chance against the third seed Djokovic, but after contesting the French and US Open finals last season against Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, Ruud knew what level it would take for him to match Djokovic in a grand slam final. Ruud started the match vaporising his forehand as he took an early break, while Djokovic started the match poorly. He played passively while he sprayed forehands and missed overheads. The benefit of being Djokovic, though, is that he always has options. He dug in and he relied on his legs as he soaked up a series of stinging Ruud forehands before retrieving the early break. Still, the Norwegian kept his head up. The decisive moment of the match came while he led 5-4 with Djokovic serving. Ruud opened the game with some inspirational play, including a successful tweener lob to lead 0-30. But at 5-4, 30-30, Ruud gifted a forehand error on an easy second serve return. Sensing Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tension, Djokovic pounced. He held serve, he forced a tiebreak and then he picked Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaker backhand apart to take the set. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He just steps up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ruud said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Either he plays ridiculous defence or he plays beautiful winners. Just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do any mistakes. He either lets you go for too much or he plays a beautiful winner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd By the second set, the Serb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nerves had evaporated. He dictated from inside the baseline, pulverising his forehand, and he continued to methodically break down Ruud\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s backhand as he neutralised his serve. Djokovic controlled the contest until the end, patiently waiting for his moment to clinch the decisive break late in the third set before closing out one of the greatest successes of his career. After the final point, he collapsed to the ground before climbing up to his player box. In recent years, Djokovic has repeatedly explained that his priorities have changed after so many years of success at all levels. Grand slam tournaments are what motivate him now. The past two weeks have been a comprehensive reflection of that approach. He spent much of the clay court season in poor shape, struggling with form and an elbow injury that forced him to withdraw from the Madrid Open. But with a historic grand slam title on the line he has met every challenge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He has this software in his head that he can switch when a grand slam comes,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Goran Ivanisevic, Djokovic\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s coach. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Grand slam is a different sport comparing to other tournaments. He switch his software. The day we arrived here, he was better, he was more motivated, he was more hungry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd During his speech, Djokovic noted that since he was a young child his goals were always to win Wimbledon and be No 1 in the world. He has surpassed those goals more than 10 times over. While the No 1 ranking and grand slam titles used to be the ultimate goal for all aspiring players, this fading, unforgettable era of greatness with Djokovic, Serena Williams, Nadal and Federer has completely changed how people view success in the sport. When young players state their goals these days, they often want to be the best of all time. That bar, 23 grand slam titles, is now in the stratosphere."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/11/wildfire-near-inverness-daviot-firefighters", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Firefighters tackle mile-long wildfire near Inverness", "lead": "Six fire engines attended the blaze, which broke out on Saturday afternoon in the village of Daviot", "author": "Rachel Hall", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T16:17:45Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764483", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0427dffa500739d75e56010b7e333ce6a89d9c08/0_0_3000_1801/500.jpg", "body": "Firefighters are tackling a wildfire near Inverness that burned throughout the night and reportedly stretches for more than a mile. Six fire engines were sent to the village of Daviot in the Highlands after the fire broke out on Saturday afternoon. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has told people nearby to stay indoors and to close all windows and doors to prevent smoke inhalation. Evacuated residents have been told not to return yet. A spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were alerted at 2.45pm on Saturday 10 June to reports of a fire in the open at Daviot, south of Inverness. Operations control initially mobilised one fire appliance to the scene, increasing to six appliances and specialist resources. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As of Sunday 11 June, three appliances and specialist resources remain on scene to make the area safe. No casualties have been reported.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It is understood that hailstones and torrential rain in Inverness are helping firefighters tackle the blaze. The service has extended a very high wildfire warning to 12 June as a result of a lack of rain, hot weather and little wind, which it said was the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153perfect combination\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for wildfires. People are urged not to light fires in the countryside, to carefully dispose of cigarettes and to avoid leaving glass bottles strewn about, which can focus the sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rays and cause smouldering. People in Inverness reported smelling smoke during the night on social media. Duncan Macpherson, a Highland councillor for Inverness South, tweeted: He also posted images showing a bright blaze and plumes of smoke extending over a long stretch of hillside bordering a lake. The fire started near a caravan park at about 2.45pm on Saturday, which was the hottest day of the year so far in Scotland. Much of the rest of the UK also recorded its hottest day of the year on Saturday, with temperatures reaching 32.2C in Chertsey, Surrey. They were also high on Sunday, although blue skies and sunshinewere interrupted by thundery showers in some places. A hot weather alert is in place for most of south and central England. On Sunday, temperatures in Inverness reached 24C. The Daviot fire follows one near Cannich in the Highlands that lasted for four days after breaking out on 28 May. It is believed to be one of the largest ever in the UK. Firefighters said it had burned across about 30 square miles of land. Another wildfire started on 6 June on the Campsie Fells north of Glasgow. MSPs have urged the Scottish government to look into wildfire prevention beyond awareness campaigns, for example by restoring peatlands and managing the fuel load in vulnerable landscapes."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/11/tunisia-president-kais-saied-migration-europe-border-guard-comments-imf-bailout", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "EU may give Tunisia more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn in aid to help finances and stem migration", "lead": "Ursula von der Leyen says \u00e2\u201a\u00ac900m will be macrofinancial assistance while \u00e2\u201a\u00ac105m will help combat people-smuggling", "author": "Lisa O'Carroll Brussels correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T16:16:28Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764485", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/40cd2170e2a91c8a4a36bd7c5e7df4c8f1868ddc/0_307_4928_2957/500.jpg", "body": "The European Union is considering providing more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn (\u00c2\u00a3850m) in aid for Tunisia to rescue state finances and deal with a migration crisis, the EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday. Speaking in Tunisia, Von der Leyen said \u00e2\u201a\u00ac900m would be macrofinancial assistance while an immediate \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150m would support a reform agenda set by the International Monetary Fund. She said this could be ready \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as soon as the necessary agreement is found\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, without elaborating. As part of the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1bn package, a further \u00e2\u201a\u00ac105m will be funnelled into a new partnership with Tunisia to combat people-smuggling, human trafficking and the continuing tragedies at sea. The EU chief was visiting Tunisia along with the Italian and Dutch prime ministers, Giorgia Meloni and Mark Rutte, who are keen to strike a partnership deal with the north African country to stem migration and people-smuggling to Europe. It is the second time in a week that Meloni has visited the country. The EU, like other major donors to Tunisia, has so far conditioned its support on the country finalising a loan programme with the IMF, but President Kais Saied has rejected key reforms required by that plan. He also pushed back on Saturday at a Turkey-style refugee partnership, saying the country would not act as Europe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s border guard. The EU is concerned that if the economic crisis in Tunisia deepens, Europe will face an even bigger increase of irregular migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean this summer. Saied has said cuts to subsidies and restructuring of state-owned companies, which his own government proposed to the IMF to reassure lenders they would be repaid, risked igniting a social explosion. Any new agreement based on different proposed reforms could take months more to negotiate. Meloni has pressed for the IMF to relax conditions for the loan. She said on Sunday the EU and Tunisia had already signed a joint declaration, which she hailed as an important step \u00e2\u20ac\u0153towards the creation of a real partnership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She said there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an important window of opportunity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to finalise the aid agreement before the European Council at the end of June. It was not clear if Tunisia would still need to finalise its IMF programme to qualify. On Sunday the EU laid out details of a partnership programme that would strengthen economic and trade ties with Tunisia, including a comprehensive air transport agreement that could help tourism and a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150m \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Medusa\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd digital cable link to Europe which it said could support research and education in the country. It also signed a memorandum of understanding on renewable energy. Von der Leyen said the EU would also expand opportunities for young Tunisians to study, work and train in the EU to help them develop skills that could be used to boost the Tunisian economy. The Tunisian pact comes just three days after EU member states agreed radical reforms to its proposed migration laws allowing Italy to deport economic migrants to countries such as Tunisia if a deal with the country enabled such returns."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/jun/11/hot-in-here-review-pigfoot-hetty-hodgson-gate-theatre-london", "primaryCategory": "stage", "title": "Hot in Here review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bike-powered show tells the haunting human stories behind the climate crisis", "lead": "Raw, current and fresh, this three-woman play about the unfair impact of global emissions leaves you fired up and outraged", "author": "Anya Ryan", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T16:05:09Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764487", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a4ad61970407ebdb2cadc4da29ebda9cbc7e58af/889_243_5032_3019/500.jpg", "body": "If we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re judging on ambition alone, then Hot in Here has it all.

Made by Pigfoot, the UK\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first rigorously sustainable theatre company, and directed by Hetty Hodgson, it shows the disproportionate effects of the climate crisis for marginalised communities, those living in poverty and people from the global south.

In the first moment I thought about shooting strong but then I realised there were six or seven players in the goal area and I was like: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcNo, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to put it in the first post.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 The end result was incredible but there was half an hour still to go so it was a big effort from all of us.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kevin De Bruyne was forced off after only 36 minutes because of an ongoing hamstring problem, the Belgian being replaced by Phil Foden. This followed him also being taken off in the 2021 Champions League defeat against Chelsea with a face injury. Rodri said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He can rest now. The moment that Kev was injured again, in another big final, we were like: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOne of our big guys has come out.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 But Phil was amazing. This talked about the team, all of us. Kevin has been excellent. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to talk much about him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a leader. He deserves this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rodri, meanwhile, has been named as the Champions League player of the year by Uefa as seven City players made the team of the season and Haaland took goal of the season honours. Rodri was joined by six City stars in the team of the season as Haaland, De Bruyne, John Stones, R\u00c3\u00baben Dias, Bernardo Silva and Kyle Walker were all included. City also scooped the goal of the season award through Haaland for his acrobatic strike against Borussia Dortmund during the group stages."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/11/trump-indictment-william-barr", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "William Barr says Trump may be \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctoast\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 after \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcvery damning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 indictment ", "lead": "Former attorney general who has largely broken with Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcshocked by the degree of sensitivity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of documents", "author": "Maya Yang", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T15:48:16Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764491", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b0ec7f33a046f62c81cf5af5f8399719a0e21a9b/0_12_3500_2100/500.jpg", "body": "Donald Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former attorney general William Barr believes that the former president may be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153toast\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as he faces a sweeping indictment of 37 federal criminal charges over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Speaking to Fox News on Sunday following the release of the indictment, Barr, who served as the US attorney general under Trump from 2019 to 2020, said that he was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shocked by the degree of sensitivity at these documents and how many there were\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I do think we have to wait and see what the defense says and what proves to be true. But I do think \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 if even half of it is true, then he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toast \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very detailed indictment and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very damning,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Barr. Barr has largely broken with Trump since he left office. His comments stand in stark contrast to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tirade against federal prosecutors who he said are pursuing him as part of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153witch-hunt\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Barr added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s agenda was to \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 protect those documents and get them out and I think it was perfectly appropriate to do that. It was the right thing to do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Barr went on to push back against Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s narrative that he is the victim of a broader government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hoax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Presenting Trump as a victim here, the victim of a witch-hunt, is ridiculous.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a victim in the past. His adversaries have obsessively pursued him with phony claims and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been at his side defending against him when he is a victim, but this is much different. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a victim here,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Barr. According to the indictment unsealed on Friday, Trump stored classified documents in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a ballroom, a bathroom and shower, an office space, his bedroom, and a storage room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. It also added that Trump directed Walt Nauta, his valet and aide, to deliberately move boxes of records to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conceal them from Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney, the FBI, and the grand jury\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Documents possessed by Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153included information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack, and plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said the indictment. Barr said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153. Those documents are among the most sensitive secrets that the country has. They have to be in the custody of the archivist. He had no right to maintain them and retain them. And he kept them in a way at Mar-a-Lago that anyone who really cares about national security, their stomach would churn at it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he added. In addition to being charged with mishandling classified documents, Trump has been charged with several counts of obstruction of justice as well as making false statements to investigators. Trump has repeatedly maintained his innocence. In two fiery addresses on Saturday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c his first public speeches since the federal indictment against him, the GOP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top presidential contender told crowds of supporters in Georgia and North Carolina that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153will never be detained\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He also lashed out against federal officials, saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now the Marxist left is once again using the same corrupt DoJ [justice department] and the same corrupt FBI, and the attorney general and the local district attorneys to interfere \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re cheating. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re crooked. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re corrupt. These criminals cannot be rewarded. They must be defeated.

The three men have received a warm welcome here at the GMB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual congress, where they have shared their story with fellow activists \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and won the support of the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That spaceship, that boat of his: he would have none of that if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for his workers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Westwood\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colleague, Garfield Hylton. Later this week, the GMB will concede defeat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for now \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in its fight for formal union recognition at Amazon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge Coventry warehouse, known as BHX4. But in their black branded T-shirts, the three men \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Westwood and Hylton, both 58, and their 27-year-old colleague Salar Kazim \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are insistent that the momentum remains with them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going away; we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only going to grow,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Westwood. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sooner or later, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have recognition in Coventry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153From the time we started, and we grew like this, it is all the time a pleasure,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Kazim, originally from Kurdistan, in northern Iraq. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The best time was during the strikes: we were together, we were talking, and it is really good being involved.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd With chatting all but impossible on the packing lines, their campaign has built firm bonds \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite the wide range of languages spoken on site. Hylton says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got Polish, Brazilian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Swahili. You need to have a map of the world!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The trio describe a high-pressure working environment inside BHX4, where every move is constantly monitored. Any anomaly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c such as a few minutes without scanning an item \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can bring a laptop-wielding manager to their workstation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They can monitor you, per minute, per task \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s micromanagement,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Hylton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcscanner adherence\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you have to be scanning every minute, to show a constant, rapid scan.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Kazim previously enjoyed his job, known as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153indirect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which saw him moving around the site to perform a range of different tasks, free of minute-by-minute monitoring. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I did love that job actually; it was inspiring,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. But he became disillusioned when he had to switch to less physically demanding work after sustaining a knee injury. All three men talk of how physically demanding the job is: Westwood says he once clocked up 16km on a shift; Kazim says that on one occasion, he walked as far as 32km. Breaks are limited, and some roles involve lifting heavy loads. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When you do a concentrated job, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realise how much your body is being punished,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Kazim. Having worked intensively through the Covid crisis, when at-home shopping soared, staff in Coventry hoped for a generous pay rise when the pandemic abated. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are the ones who worked through the pandemic. We risked our lives,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Kazim. So when managers announced an increase of just 50p an hour last August, taking the basic rate to \u00c2\u00a310.50, some staff felt insulted \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a reaction shared at some other Amazon sites, where spontaneous protests broke out. In Coventry, some workers walked off the packing lines and gathered in the canteen. Later, they arranged to meet and discuss their grievances at an easy-to-find rendezvous point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c outside Primark. Organisers from the GMB\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s West Midlands region had been painstakingly building up a presence at Amazon for more than a decade, mainly focusing on a site in Rugeley, 40 miles away. When they got wind of the protest in Coventry, they sped over. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We got to Primark, we got our hi-vis on, we just started chatting to people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recalls local GMB activist Rachel Fagan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We just listened to what they wanted and what they wanted to do. And they were saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThese workers have had enough, and they want to tell their story.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Westwood says he had previously felt no need for a union \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but he and his colleagues turned to the GMB to help them channel their anger into organising. With Amazon well known worldwide as being sceptical about unions, there followed an intensive period of secretive recruitment. Messages appearing on screens inside the building in recent days and seen by the Guardian told staff: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The union wants you to pay \u00c2\u00a314.57 every month for them to speak for you. We believe having a voice shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cost you anything\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. By word of mouth and WhatsApp, the organisers inside the warehouse built up their numbers from a few dozen to over a hundred \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and by September, were balloting for strike action. That first ballot was lost, by just a handful of votes, but they staged a rerun a few weeks later, as membership continued to build. Just after midnight on 25 January, dozens of workers left the building before the end of their shifts and walked out into the freezing night, kicking off the first ever strike action against Amazon in the UK. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That first walkout was spectacular,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Westwood. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it would work; not because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t trust what we were doing, but because of the pressure. It was only 50 or 60 people, but because they were coming out in dribs and drabs, it just felt awesome.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd They were demanding a pay rise, to \u00c2\u00a315 an hour; but Fagan, from the GMB, is frank about the fact that they were also using the industrial action to give the staff a platform to tell their stories. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the point of having industrial action when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only got 30, 40, 50 members in a workplace?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Well, we used it, we knew that the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eyes would be on it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. They won the support of local Labour MP, Taiwo Owatemi, and US union activists who had recently secured recognition at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island joined an online rally to show solidarity and exchange tips. Amazon awarded its staff another pay rise earlier this year, and has also recently improved conditions for working parents \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something it has trumpeted in slick online ads. Over the course of the dispute, which most recently saw workers involved in two three-day stoppages, membership of the GMB has increased dramatically, to more than 800. The GMB believed that was enough to convince the independent Central Arbitration Committee, which has the power to order a company to recognise a union, that it had more than 50% support at the site. That hope was dashed on Thursday, however, after the committee agreed with Amazon that as many as 2,700 staff are employed at BHX4. The GMB suspects Amazon of going on a hiring spree to scupper its bid for recognition, something the company denies. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It happened at breakneck speed. We don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know where they found all these fresh faces,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Hylton. But the GMB has reluctantly admitted defeat for now, rather than risk losing a recognition ballot, which would bar it from reapplying for three years. A spokesperson for Amazon said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We respect our employees\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rights to join, or not to join, a union. We offer competitive pay, comprehensive benefits, opportunities for career growth, all while working in a safe, modern, work environment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Back in Brighton, Westwood, Kazim and Hylton, fresh from addressing hundreds of delegates about their experiences, say they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already achieved change, by working together. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By talking, you share things; you realise you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in isolation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Hylton. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It makes you feel a bit angry, to be honest. But now they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re standing up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/11/24-hours-of-le-mans-ferrari-lebron-james", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "Ferrari on top with triumphant return at centennial 24 Hours of Le Mans", "lead": "Ferrari returned to the top with victory at the centennial 24 Hours of Le Mans in a monumental feat after not competing in the event since 1973", "author": "Giles Richards at Circuit de la Sarthe", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T15:22:15Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764495", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/e8f08b35ccdabe44259a8bb8f00df89f9da3c264/0_264_5118_3071/500.jpg", "body": "Driving into history with a stone-cold classic race to mark its 100th anniversary, the centennial 24 Hours of Le Mans delivered on every level, not least in an equally historic return to the top for Ferrari. Scriptwriters tasked with pencilling a storyline to honour the occasion would surely have not dared imagine a plot quite as gripping, or as unlikely, as the one that unfolded at the Circuit de la Sarthe. For half a century the Scuderia have not competed in the top class at Le Mans but they came back in style, taking a mighty victory at the first time of asking and after an immense struggle in a vingt-quatre more than worthy of marking the occasion. Le Mans has long been inextricably linked with Ferrari, not least with their six consecutive victories between 1960 and 1965 but the Scuderia last competed here at the top level in 1973 and while they have taken nine wins, the last was back in 1965. The scale of their achievement this year cannot be underestimated. Conventional wisdom has it that it takes three years of competition at the 24 to be in a place to challenge for victory. Given it was at the first attempt after such a long absence and in a field that included hugely competitive entries from Porsche, Toyota Peugeot and Cadillac, this was a monumental feat. This 100th anniversary of the first 24 Heures du Mans held in 1923 heralded the debut of the new hypercar class, and the excitement and expectation for this new era of endurance racing had been building for several years. By the time race weekend arrived it was reaching a crescendo. On the Eurostar out of London on Friday there was a party atmosphere in anticipation of the weekend that was to come, drinks were being taken and new friends being made. Le Mans always has the celebratory air of a reunion but this one felt special, almost as if 30 years had passed since the last. By the time LeBron James waved the tricolour to start the race at 4pm on Saturday, it was long sold out to the tune of 300,000 fans, for the first time in its storied history. There was nary an inch of space in any viewing area around the 8.46-mile track. Beyond the packed grandstands, spectators clung to the chain link fences as they clung to their beers, five and six deep in every possible space and they were not to be disappointed. When the No 51 Ferrari 499P of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Alessandro Pier Guidi, Antonio Giovinazzi and Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s James Calado took the flag, they had come out on top after a blow for blow battle that had lasted for almost all of the full 24 hours over the No 8 Toyota of S\u00c3\u00a9bastian Buemi, Brendon Hartley and Ryo Hirakawa. There had been scant seconds in it for all but the final hour and a half, when a late off for the Toyota proved costly. By the time the clock counted out the final moments Ferrari had completed 342 laps and still only had 1 minute and 21 seconds on their rival. The tone had been set from the off, a frenetic opening six hours interrupted by sudden and intense downpours that disappeared almost as soon as they had arrived. Climactic interjections as if of the hand of an unseen director, inexplicably of the opinion an already gripping spectacle needed further inspiration. Ferrari, Toyota, Porsche, Cadillac and Peugeot, the lead changed hands between them all as they raced into the night. Peugeot were the first to fall down the field, with an off at the first chicane. Mechanical issues as always played their part but Porsche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main challenge fell away when K\u00c3\u00a9vin Estre crashed after a tangle with an LMP2 car. Cadillac gamely stayed in the hunt but by mid morning it was a two-way fight between the last men standing at Ferrari and Toyota. Both ran at relentless pace and repeatedly exchanged the lead until the Toyota\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s late off. Ferrari being Ferrari, there was of course a last, impossibly tense, twist as on the final pit stop the car sat in its box, unable to restart. The seconds ticked away, the car stood shock still as blood drained from faces across the garage. Yet there was no panic, nerves held, Pier Guidi gave his reluctant prancing horse the requisite sugar lump, and off it went for him to guide the Scuderia home. Ferrari\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Formula One driver Charles Leclerc was at the race to support his teammates and it should be noted that the team\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s return to top-level sports car racing was partly born out of its need to reallocate resources away from their F1 team because of the limitations imposed on staffing by the budget cap. As the Scuderia struggle in F1, the irony of them delivering such an impressive car, bulletproof on reliability, with fearsome straight line speed that was the differentiator in a highly competitive field and a consummate operational execution, will probably not be missed at Maranello. Leclerc could perhaps only observe wistfully as the team proved just how good it can be. Calado is twice a GT class winner at Le Mans and for the 33-year-old from Cropthorne his first overall win in his first shot at the top level was a moment he will not forget. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great for the team, for Ferrari after so long,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insane, there were a lot of doubters because we are known as GT drivers but we proved a point today.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It was a win for the ages that must be added to the pantheon of some of Le Mans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 greatest meetings, a race proving itself to be in rude health despite having already put 100 years on the clock. The special event was also marked by another equally memorable achievement of historical significance, with the all-female Iron Dames team claiming fourth in the GTE-AM class in their Porsche, the highest in class for an all-female team since Lella Lombardi and Christine Beckers were fourth in 1977. The Cadillac of Earl Bamber, Alex Lynn and Richard Westbrook was in third place. The LMP2 class was won by the Inter Europol Competition team of Fabio Scherer, Albert Costa and Jakub Smiechowski.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly obvious territory for opera, but this 75-minute opener to the year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Aldeburgh festival held the attention in a compelling, albeit sometimes uneasy way, the music\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eerie metallic edge as transfixing as the moral ambiguities of the 18th-century story. The steep rake of the Britten Studio became a lecture theatre where anatomy students watched grisly dissection processes, with cadavers \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before the Anatomy Act of 1832 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all too often provided by bodysnatchers. Hunter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s insatiable curiosity in investigating the nature of disease and death led him to preserve and exhibit his collection of anatomical specimens, still on view at the Royal College of Surgeons\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Hunterian Museum. His conviction that Byrne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s body would yield vital secrets led to unseemly bartering with the young man, who was genetically destined to die young. But Hunter would ultimately be proved right as DNA testing recently revealed the rare genetic mutation causing the gigantism. Hunter, however, only got Byrne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s corpse by illicitly, unethically intercepting it before its burial at sea. Byrne died in 1783 at just 22. Known as the Irish Giant, he became a celebrity in the years before his death, a freak show in a Haymarket show (Gweneth Ann Rand is the strong impresario figure, Mr Rooker, here). Hilary Mantel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1998 novel The Giant, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Brien told his story and the history has emerged again as Byrne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skeleton, exhibited over centuries at the Hunterian, has now been withdrawn from public view. Part of Angliss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s skill is precisely in eliciting sympathy for both Byrne and Hunter, their sung phrases vividly suggesting dimensions of their characters. Hunter, occasionally uncouth in his zeal, also understood the lived anguish of Byrne: his offer to ease his final months with money and laudanum carried compassion, reflected well by baritone Jonathan Gunthorpe. Yet Byrne would not give in. This tender-hearted giant, perceived to be nearer heaven, was used by mothers as a means of intercession with their dead children; yet in reality he was isolated and suffering, a fate tenor Karim Sulayman \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a properly towering figure thanks to platform boots and raised staging \u00e2\u20ac\u201c expresses poignantly. Befitting the period, Angliss\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s score combines baroque sounds with percussion instruments of her own creation, notably bells, with violins and viola, all subtly manipulated electronically, the folk-like inflections invoking the Irish mountains of home and the implicit sense that Byrne should be returned there.

Dodd, a former Matildas vice-captain and trail-blazing sports administrator, represented Australia at the 1988 Fifa Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Invitation Tournament. The event in southern China was a test-run for the first Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s World Cup in 1991. Next month, Australia will co-host the the 2023 World Cup; with 1m tickets already sold, it is expected to be the most-attended women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sporting event in history. Women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football has come a long way since the Matildas walked out for their opening match of the 1988 tournament, beating Brazil in the summer heat in Jiangmen. But Dodd says even then they had no doubts about the sport\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trajectory. The \u00e2\u20ac\u015388ers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd gathered on Zoom earlier this month to reflect on that match 35 years on. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There were a lot of people at that game,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dodd says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For me, it was the first time I had played in front of a crowd of 15,000 or so. That, for us, was the moment we felt the game was getting the spotlight it deserved. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We always knew the sport is fantastic to play and watch, and I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t figure out why the rest of the world didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dodd acknowledges the lengthy bans on women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football in the early 1900s played a big part in that. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Most of us grew up watching football, seeing men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crowds, and imagining that as the game that we could play,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to say \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI told you so,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but I think that those childhood visions are now coming through for the generation playing now. And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fabulous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just so, so happy to see it unfold.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dodd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the rapid growth of women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football, as a member of the 88ers and a leading global football administrator, was recognised this week with her appointment as an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in King Charles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday honours list. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great tribute to how far football has come and how far women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sport has come in Australia,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dodd says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And I think it is a tribute to the communities that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m part of, that are also very much part of [the upcoming] World Cup: the LGBTQ+ community and the Asian Australian community.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The honour recognises an incredible career, from suburban Adelaide to the heights of international sport. Since ending her playing days and becoming a lawyer, Dodd has served on the governing boards of Football Australia, the Asian Football Confederation and Fifa (she was one of the first women to ever join the body\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s executive committee), plus a host of sporting NGOs and charities. Even Dodd, who prefers driving change to being in the spotlight and tries to deflect attention, pauses to concede pride in this recognition. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am proud \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and am proud of the Australia it reflects,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And it reflects football\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experience too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c football was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcothered\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for many decades.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dodd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s father was a firefighter, her mother a Chinese Seventh-Day Adventist and a vegetarian \u00e2\u20ac\u0153before it was popular\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was conscious that we were different; people like us didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t belong to the mainstream, to the establishment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dodd says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Thanks to free university education, and thanks to an Australia that is prepared to embrace people with different experiences and backgrounds, it is a country where someone like me can win an award like this.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But she expresses concern about the current rise of populism and inequality, adding: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s make sure Australia continues to be the land of the fair go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dodd says her honour is a tribute to all those who came before her, and the many people and organisations she has worked with to effect change (such as embedding gender equality in Fifa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governing framework). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a recognition of all the pioneers who made women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football what it is today,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. Dodd highlights the 100-year-plus history of women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s football in Australia. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At least the first 50 or 60 years was done without any international recognition whatsoever. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the shoulders of all of those pioneers we stand.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On 20 July the Matildas will walk into Stadium Australia to an anticipated record-breaking crowd for their first World Cup match. Three and a half decades since Dodd and her teammates took part in the Fifa Invitational, the scene will underscore how far the game has come. Dodd will be in the stands \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cheering loudly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Every time the Matildas play, I think the Matildas alumni feel a sense of being out there with them,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Certainly I do. All the pre-match feelings you had as a player come back. It is a massive moment for Australia. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s this sense of the unknown when you play in such a big game, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like climbing a mountain, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how you are going to perform at altitude until you go out there and have a go.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But Dodd has always had a pretty good sense of where the game is heading, and she is prepared to suggest that we have not reached the mountain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s peak just yet. I have always felt that I knew how this was going to end,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And let me tell you, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even better stuff to come.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jun/12/the-ominous-allure-of-the-teddy-bear-in-art-we-all-just-want-to-be-babies", "primaryCategory": "culture", "title": "The ominous allure of the teddy bear in art: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe all just want to be babies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122", "lead": "Two works at this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dark Mofo festival recast children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toys in a menacing light \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a tradition that has a long history in pop culture", "author": "Michael Sun", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T15:00:56Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764500", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5e7151b8f47c8c606a936b711fcc4ed7cfe3f6d4/405_331_793_476/500.jpg", "body": "In Harrington Lane in Hobart, Tasmania, a monstrous teddy bear towers seven metres above the pavement in a vacant lot.

This is Giant Teddy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an aptly named work by the Korean-Australian artist EJ Son that looms above this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dark Mofo festival. Its previous iteration was a quarter of the size: a human-sized bear shown at an independent Sydney gallery that danced and swayed. Giant Teddy, meanwhile, stands ominously still with a military stoicism. Embedded in its nose is a camera surveilling the revellers before it, streaming to a TV screen a few streets over and an ongoing feed on the festival website. Giant Teddy is always watching. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Teddy has lasers shooting out of its eyes too,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Son laughs. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re hit in the eyes with this laser, you will be blind.

By making them cute, we make them non-threatening,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they say. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like that for me as well, because someone would see me and they would never find me threatening.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pop culture has long been fascinated with the horror potential of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s toys \u00e2\u20ac\u201c extracting their innate creepiness by remaking them into nightmarish, demonic objects. It was happening as early as 1929 with the musical film The Great Gabbo, in which an unblinking, wide-eyed puppet drives its ventriloquist to madness; in the intervening decades, killer dolls and bloodthirsty plushies have made appearances in everything from The Twilight Zone to YouTube sensation Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Hug Me I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Scared. A few, such as Chucky, have become household names. Others \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Squid Game\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s baby-faced animatronic, or M3gan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have ascended to viral fame. Sometimes they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not so murderous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c think Ted, the bellicose, profanity-prone bear voiced by Seth MacFarlane. Toys, in all their glory and gore, also feature in another work at this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dark Mofo: Jason Phu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operatic tragedy Without Us You Would Have Never Learnt About Love, performed by a sprawling chorus of repurposed figurines and stuffed animals. Among the throng is a smaller, decapitated prototype of Son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s teddy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c alongside multiple Duracell bunnies, Winnie the Pooh and friends and makeshift companions constructed from cardboard and Mi Goreng packets. Under the vaulting rafters of Hobart\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Baha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122i Centre of Learning, the toys spin and quiver as one, luminous under stage light. For 14 minutes, they sing their doleful ditty: a sample-built composition featuring Rihanna, Jimi Hendrix and a soundbite from a video titled Crazy Donkey Sound Top 5 Donkey Sounds. It feels strangely numinous. Phu sees it as a shrine. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve probably all been to a cemetery and placed flowers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the acclaimed Sydney artist says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We might have photos of friends or lovers on our mantelpiece \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 or you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a little bowl of trinkets your friends have given you. To me, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little shrine, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little space of remembrance. And remembrance doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to be sad or tragic.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The opera, then, is a shrine to childhood nostalgia, even if the work is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bit horror-esque,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Phu admits. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a collision between the past \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the halcyon days of juvenescence \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the brain-wormed language of the present internet, where legions of online hobbyists \u00e2\u20ac\u0153jailbreak toys or remodel them to sing songs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The weirdest example might be the trend of Frankenstein Furbies: creations with names such as Sexy Furby and Long Furby where the hapless creatures have been modified with six-packs and endlessly noodly torsos, equal parts unsettling and alluring. Phu says they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a direct analogy to his work, though he does consider them akin to outsider art: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You know, I got a lot of respect for people just making shit in their spare time because they love it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Toys, for Phu, have earned their place in adult culture. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same as art, [which] sometimes people see as a kid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thing. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why they stop doing it, [when actually] it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a basic life skill to make art.

The concept of Rising festival\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 10,000 Kazoos event was as absurd as it was strangely appealing, so of course I jumped at the chance to attend with Jo and my friend Lauren.

Also, that we were going for the world record of the biggest mass kazooing event. Finally, I thought, finally I will make my parents proud. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Standing in the square waiting for this moment, spontaneous kazooing broke out. We kazooed to Rick Astley (Cursed). We kazooed to Pachelbel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Canon (as a longsuffering wedding cellist, this healed something deep inside me). We kazooed to Billie Eilish. I started to become pretty good at it. Then a stranger walked up to Lauren, Jo and me. He introduced himself as Ciaran \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the kazoo king himself \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and asked if we wanted to go up on to the stage. My god, I thought. My talent has been recognised. My big break has arrived. On stage, we danced with Betty Grumble, who led aerobics routines and encouraged a kazoo tribute to Tina Turner. I stood behind Sammy J, the leader of the kazoo orchestra, as he commanded the people down below. I looked out on to the sea of kazoos and I noticed that some of them were shiny \u00e2\u20ac\u201c people had BYO-ed theirs \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and some enterprising young children had stacked kazoos on to the ends of one another to make large kazoo horns. Here with my bird\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eye view of my fellow Melburnians who were as unhinged as me to show up to this event, I saw the best of humanity. Strangely, the actual performance \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which turned out to be an accompaniment to a story of a lonely flying kazoo in Melbourne, searching for community \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was kind of an anticlimax. We simply kazooed our interpretations of emojis on the screen to add to this tale. But after humming (not blowing) into this little plastic instrument for over an hour, and saying the word kazoo so many times that it lost all meaning, I felt something inside of me release. This was the dumbest thing I had ever done and yet I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ever felt so joyful or free. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care how silly it was, or whether so many people publicly and aggressively breathing for an hour was going to be a super-spreader event. My inner child was beaming at what was, in Sammy J\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s words, a sweet, beautiful, absurd moment. Here I was, 34 years old, standing on a stage in front of thousands of people, playing the kazoo. Only in Melbourne. And then after the kazooing was done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after we had broken the world record \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we looked up, and there was a goddamn rainbow over Fed Square, like the lord himself was smiling down on this wacky congregation of freaks. It was annoying. It was funny. It was stupid and delightful. Just like life.

The cancellation of Sunday mass at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh came at the request of the diocese after protesting emails and calls, some of them threatening, officials said. While the exact nature of the protest messages is unclear, they come at a time when major brands like Target, Bud Light and Starbucks have faced rightwing backlash for using the Pride labeling.

The report by the Council to Homeless Persons compared data from the 2021 census with the previous survey in 2016. It found the electorate of South Barwon, which takes in parts of greater Geelong, had the biggest rise in people experiencing homelessness in that period \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a jump of 465%. South Barwon has also seen a tenfold increase in people living in boarding houses since 2016. The rise is not only due to an increase in the number of homeless people, but also more accurate data collection that properly counts people in a broader range of situations, particularly those living in rooming and boarding houses. The electorate of Melton, on Melbourne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s western fringe, also had a large increase over the five years to 2021, with the total number of homeless people rising by 134%. The rate of homelessness in Victoria increased by five points over that period, from 42 to 47 people per 10,000. There were 122,494 people estimated to be homeless around Australia on census night in 2021. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The report comes days after Guardian Australia revealed new data that shows where people were living immediately prior to seeking housing support, with local government areas on the outer ring of Melbourne, including Brimbank, Casey and Wyndham, emerging as hotspots for people falling into homelessness. Deborah Di Natale, the chief executive of the Council to Homeless Persons, said the Victorian government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent commitments to building social housing were welcome, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but that is not enough in terms of the decades of neglect we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had here in homelessness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we need is a long-term plan,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool of social housing has grown by just 74 units in four years despite the government embarking on a multibillion-dollar \u00e2\u20ac\u0153big housing build\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while the social housing waitlist has grown by about 45%, with 67,985 households on the register in March. Di Natale called on the state and federal governments to act further on housing support, including bringing in inclusionary zoning, which can include social housing quotas for new developments as well as developer taxes to pay for the construction of social and affordable homes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We would like the Victorian government to be having a discussion with the construction industry about inclusionary zoning, so that some income is coming in, in terms of the housing build across decades,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Di Natale said. In March last year, the Andrews government announced but then abruptly scrapped plans to impose a 1.75% levy on new developments of more than three dwellings to pay for the construction of thousands of social and affordable homes. The plans were dumped after two weeks following public backlash from the building and property sectors. This was despite the government claiming they had reached a deal on the reforms, with the treasurer, Tim Pallas, attributing the plans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 demise to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negative\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd industry response and the spread of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153misinformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as part of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mischievous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scare campaign. Victoria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deputy premier and planning minister have since begun work on a planning package aimed at boosting housing supply, which is set to be announced in coming months. The premier, Daniel Andrews, has said this package could include incentives for developers to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153embed affordable housing in each of the new developments that they make\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. However, such a move will likely face opposition from the powerful Property Council of Australia, which also opposed the dumped social housing levy. Cath Evans, the Property Council of Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Victorian executive director, said mandatory inclusionary zoning was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a tax on at-market dwellings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often countering the policy objectives of providing more affordable housing\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The property industry stands ready to work productively with governments in bringing our capabilities to bear to build more social housing stock, but mandatory inclusionary zoning is not the way to do it,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Guardian Australia understands the government is also considering stripping councils of their planning powers in an effort to fast-track developments, as well as increasing ground lease arrangements, which involve handing over public land to a consortium of developers and community housing providers on long-term leases."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/12/calls-for-comprehensive-ban-on-sports-gambling-ads-in-australia-as-inquirys-report-looms", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "Calls for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccomprehensive ban\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 on sports gambling ads in Australia as inquiry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s report looms", "lead": "Tim Costello hopeful of bipartisanship on issue to \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbreak the grip\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 of saturation advertising", "author": "Henry Belot", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T15:00:55Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764508", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a40921a24bb7712154b8c2585924b9a0494b2a45/0_156_3260_1957/500.jpg", "body": "The Australian government has been urged to seize a once-in-a-generation opportunity to clamp down on gambling advertising, as anti-gambling advocates and public health experts await the outcome of a parliamentary inquiry that is expected to issue policy recommendations this week. The head of the inquiry, Labor MP Peta Murphy, has already cited powerful evidence of community harm, and the recommendations are expected to call for further restrictions to gambling advertisements before and after live sport broadcasts. That idea now has bipartisan support. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, used his budget reply speech to lobby for change and the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has expressed his personal dislike of the ads. While few will miss the ads, which have led to children being able to identify companies by their brand colours, pushback from some in the industry is likely. Peak bodies have already warned of cuts to grassroots sport or to free coverage of sport if advertising revenue drops. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But community opposition to the ads has hardened since the inquiry was launched days before the 2022 AFL grand final. A recent survey of 3,000 AFL fans found gambling ads were their most common concern, with a majority supporting an outright ban. That is unlikely to happen, despite some support from some MPs across all sides of politics. Tim Costello, a prominent anti-gambling campaigner, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a chance of bipartisanship is possible to break the grip of the saturation gambling advertising\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Like tobacco advertising, which is now banned, a prohibition on gambling advertising should be the goal,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Costello said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just as it is unacceptable for children to know the brands Peter Stuyvesant and Marlboro cigarettes, why should they know Sportsbet or Bet365? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is a terrible policy failure and Australia has per capita 20% higher online losses than others because of the tsunami of sports betting advertising.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Charles Livingstone, a gambling researcher who appeared before the inquiry, said advertising should be phased out over time and the government could offer support to codes and broadcasters to ease their financial concerns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The overwhelming tone of submissions has been that we need to act on gambling advertising at the very least,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Livingston said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Another thing that could be done quickly is require anyone who gambles to set a limit, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voluntary at this stage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Samantha Thomas, a gambling and health researcher at Deakin University, urged the government to consider wagering as a public health issue and increase the health department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anything less than a comprehensive ban on all forms of marketing will leave us with measures that still give the gambling industry scope to expose young people to its promotions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Thomas said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Just like we did with tobacco, we must ensure that gambling harm prevention policies are protected from the vested interests of the gambling industry and those who profit from it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shane Lucas, who leads the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation, said the federal government should have no doubt what many Australians want. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The community clearly wants the commonwealth government to do more to protect children and young adults especially from constant exposure to gambling promotions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lucas said. Some gambling companies accept public sentiment has shifted. Tabcorp, one of the biggest bookies that is expanding its online presence, has vowed to restrict ads even if regulation is not tightened. Others acknowledge community concern. Campaigners believe restricting ads is one of the easiest reforms available to government. More difficult changes include the creation of a national online gambling regulator with more resources and power than state and territory alternatives. Most online gambling companies are registered in the Northern Territory, where they receive favourable tax treatment. Many campaigners have criticised the fines imposed by this body as too low to force compliance from gambling companies. The Albanese government has already introduced two changes in its first term: a ban on credit card use for online gambling and updated warning slogans to replace the much-criticised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gamble responsibly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd catchphrase at the end of adverts. When pressed to take further action in response to community concerns, ministers have routinely said they will wait to see what the gambling harm inquiry recommends."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/12/wild-west-australias-would-be-tenants-asked-about-tattoos-and-social-media-as-calls-grow-for-regulation", "primaryCategory": "australia-news", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWild west\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s would-be tenants asked about tattoos and social media as calls grow for regulation", "lead": "Another renter was told to provide a year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth of bank statements, with NSW minister saying applicants \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrightly feel uneasy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 about data collection", "author": "Cait Kelly", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T15:00:54Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764512", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/148a2be2bcf60e7245ca42983ae60b83320f3893/0_66_4134_2481/500.jpg", "body": "There are growing calls to regulate the personal information real estate agents can request from potential tenants, with renters asked to hand over 12 months\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of bank statements, their personal social media profiles and in one case, whether they had prominent tattoos.

In 2020 Ness, who did not want her last name used, was applying for a property in Kirrawee in Sydney, when the agent rang to ask if her husband, who is a tattooist, had neck tattoos. Ness lied and said he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and 20 minutes later her rental application was approved. For the year the couple lived in the property , he waited outside during inspections or rugged up to cover his tattoos. The couple had to share their social media profiles in their rental application, and Ness believed the agents checked them before they approved their lease. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It annoyed me a lot and made me concerned to bring him to look at new houses when we moved,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Rental agents are allowed to ask for whatever information they deem fit, in every state except Victoria, where they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask if tenants have taken legal action with a provider, to see daily transactions, a bond history, or about personal attributes such as race, gender and disability. In New South Wales, the better regulation and fair trading minister, Anoulack Chanthivong, said the amount of data potentially being collected was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extraordinary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.The government was working on developing regulations for what information can be asked for and kept on file. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the most part, the collection and use of renters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 data hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been regulated. Renters rightly feel uneasy and this is a big risk in a world of increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Chanthivong said. The Real Estate Institute of Australia president, Hayden Groves, said asking for six months of bank statements if the tenant was self-employed was acceptable. But any more, or asking for social media accounts or if they had tattoos, was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153irrelevant\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unnecessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Agents should be looking for information on if a tenant can service their rent and any other information was irrelevant, he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are no specific legal guidelines around the information requested by managing agents: there are code-of-conduct provisions that insist an agent must act \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcethically and honestly\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in their dealings,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Groves said. The Tenants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Union of NSW chief executive, Leo Patterson Ross, likened the application process to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wild west\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Patterson Ross said there needed to be a standardised form and a clear guide on how to assess the capacity to pay rent as some agents used 30% of income, while others used 40%. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It all comes down to agents having no real kind of structure to how they assess the application,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They assess everyone in a group, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a competitive process, rather than assessing people on their own merits.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Patterson Ross said a fair system would have agents assess applications one by one. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only relevant question is, is this person able to sustain the tenancy,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Other renters across the country said they had to provide a lot of references, sometimes up to six per person, and their social media accounts. In one case in Melbourne, the agent rang their boss, despite the would-be tenants submitting payslips. Anthony Ziebell, an administrator of Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Rent Me, a Facebook group set up to help tenants, said some applications even asked if the tenants posted about rental issues on social media. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Prospective renters are being asked for their bank and savings account balances, whether they post about rental issues on social media, and if they have ever breached a landlord or property agent,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Applicants for mortgages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c who represent a significantly larger financial risk to banks than tenants do to landlords \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often do not undergo anywhere near the same level of scrutiny,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/12/three-things-with-natalie-tran-i-dont-know-how-people-dont-have-rice-cookers-it-should-be", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "title": "Three things with Natalie Tran: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have rice cookers \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it should be illegal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122", "lead": "The YouTube comedian, actor and co-host of The Great Australian Bake Off on her mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clandestine kitchen-appliance network and a lonely sock", "author": "As told to Katie Cunningham", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T15:00:54Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764514", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/88c8e15615d9fbdaed861de8e248ed114eb9e9de/0_528_1707_1024/500.jpg", "body": "Natalie Tran first found fame on YouTube, where she posted funny videos about important topics like Taylor Swift\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s height or the stress of having your umbrella stolen.

But I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be upset if I looked in my pocket and found an old hair clip. My father discovered it lost on the side of the road one day and brought it home. It was a bit weathered with some of its stones missing, but when my father gifts something it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s because he genuinely believes it has your name etched on its surface. He means his gifts and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a wonderful thing to experience. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning So the hairpin is really just a flattering thing to have \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an affirmation that someone I love held me in their thoughts. It reminds me of a time when life felt good and safe, and my biggest responsibilities were to be a good kid and an annoying sister. My most useful object This is very cliched but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d live without the humble rice cooker that lives on our kitchen bench. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my culinary ride or die, my faithful companion, and often my only source of sustenance. Even though eating has been rumoured to be vital to staying alive, my laziness dominates and sometimes night-time will arrive before I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve eaten anything. Thankfully the rice cooker comes to my rescue, providing a meal with zero judgment and minimal effort. When the timer counts down to five minutes, I might toss in some greens and an egg, to prove my cooking prowess. I suspect this is how I landed on a cooking show. My mother once gifted me a mini, one-person rice cooker when I was about to be on the road for a few months. She knew it would be the only way I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d eat. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have rice cookers. Quite frankly, I think it should be illegal. Some people have complained to me that their rice cooker companions don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and all I can say is find a rice cooker that loves you enough to work. Rice relationships should be easy. Before you run out to find just any old rice cooker though, I should disclose that Mum acquires these from some secretive network and all cookers have arrived with a power adapter and no instructions. So if you need one, call me and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll call Mum. The item I most regret losing I think the heaviness attributed to lost objects is more guilt than regret \u00e2\u20ac\u201c guilt for not looking after something better. I can almost hear my parents gently reminding me that ownership is an illusion anyway. Dad always jokes that lost things will visit again if they want. If that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the case, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be pretty delighted if visited again by a sock that disappeared many years ago. Only because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve kept its partner just in case. They look like happy dogs and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s silly, but they make me smile. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d just be delighted if it showed up again. No relief, no guilt appeased, no regret. Just delighted.

Guardian Australia found comments by Di Farmer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c made during 2019 state parliament estimates hearings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c bluntly criticising the sorts of measures that have since been championed by the Labor government, resulting in record numbers of children in prison and soaring reoffending rates. These include comments that building new youth detention centres \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now a key element of Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law and order pitch in Queensland \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would represent a failure of government \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leadership\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to address the causes of children offending and reoffending in the community. Farmer was Queensland youth justice minister from 2017 to 2020, and had been leading a progressive evidence-based reform of the sector until mid-2020, when the state passed bail laws designed keep more children in custody on remand. She returned to the post in 2023 to address what the state has termed an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153exceptional crisis situation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, mainly related to a cohort of about 400 repeat offenders who have been in and out of detention centres, where many have been held in solitary confinement and received little or no support or rehabilitation. In 2019, Farmer said policies that focused on incarceration would guarantee reoffending. Sign up for Guardian Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we persist with a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclock them up and throw away the key\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approach with our young people, [reoffending] is exactly what will happen. There is an almost 100% chance that young people will reoffend,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. On Sunday, Farmer said her comment about a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lock them up and throw away the key\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach was targeted at the LNP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s policies. But the numbers of young people in custody have increased markedly since the LNP was in power in Queensland. In 2014-15, there were 169 children (aged 16 and under) on an average day in youth detention. On 15 March this year, the state was holding 337 young people (aged 17 and under) in custody at detention centres and police adult watch houses. Queensland now imprisons more children than any other state or territory. Reoffending rates, particularly among a cohort of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153serious repeat offenders\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, have also increased in recent years. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we do in youth justice will be based on evidence,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Farmer also told parliament in 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The community expects us to sort this and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what we will do.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Experts say the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recent policy changes shun clear and overwhelming evidence, in favour of political drum-beating in regional communities; and that punitive policies, including efforts to keep more and more children on remand, are the primary driver behind escalating recidivism. To address the explosion in the youth prison population, Queensland is building two new youth detention centres. The centres are needed, the government says, as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153population continues to grow, existing infrastructure ages and tough new laws \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to target young offenders take effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In 2019, Farmer firmly criticised the idea as a last-ditch approach. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we do not address the causes of offending and reoffending then all we will be able to promise Queenslanders is that we will build more and more detention centres now and into the future and we will never break the cycle. This requires leadership and bipartisan leadership,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Farmer sent a lengthy statement that referred to 12 government programs and $100m spending \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to tackle the complex factors that can contribute to offending, including disengagement from schooling, behavioural disorders, and drug and substance misuse\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are sorting it and addressing the causes of offending and reoffending,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Farmer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have always maintained that there is no single solution to youth crime. All stakeholders agree that it is a complex and serious issue that requires a multi-faceted approach over the long term. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Communities across Australia have witnessed a change in the nature of youth crime in recent years, and the community rightly expects us to hold serious repeat offenders to account for the harm they cause.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Labor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s management of youth justice has attracted fierce criticism from both left and right. The Greens spokesperson for youth justice, Michael Berkman, said it was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153disgraceful that we have regressed so far in just a few short years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For the minister to persist with the failed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclock them up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 response is unbelievably reckless, cynical and cruel,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Berkman said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s said herself that it will only harm children and lead to more reoffending.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The shadow attorney general, Tim Nicholls, said the government was failing children in the system and the community. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By her own measure this reheated minister has failed the test of leadership she set for herself and this government,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Nicholls said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actions have created a generation of repeat offenders, instead of intervening effectively to turn lives around.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The LNP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposals include even more punitive measures, such as removing the international law principle of detention as a last resort from the Youth Justice Act.

For Rachel Yerbury, the promise she exchanged with her husband, Justin, back in 1995 has tested her in ways most couples cannot imagine. Shortly after they married, motor neurone disease started cutting a swathe through his family. His uncle. Cousin. His grandmother, mother and sister. Justin was determined to research the disease, and set about becoming a leading molecular biologist. His work brought him to New York in 2016, a lecture hall filled with the top minds in MND research. As he stood at the lectern to give a speech on his work, his thumb stopped working. The realisation that this was the first sign of MND in his own body hit him like a punch in the face. He thought immediately, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fuck. How will I tell Rachel?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And then he continued his speech. With that, Justin became not only MND\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most high-profile crusading researcher \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but one of its sufferers. MND is a rare condition that progressively damages the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness. While the body becomes gradually paralysed, leaving only the eyes and the heart unaffected, the mind remains sharp. The inherited form of the illness that Justin has is the rarest, affecting one in 10 sufferers. There is no cure but the biologist has made significant breakthroughs in understanding the causes of the disease (mutant or damaged proteins in neurons), which last year earned him Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prestigious prize for science. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Justin and Rachel met at a New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve party in 1991 when they were both just 17. He was a tall, socially awkward athlete and she was hoping to become a school psychologist. They shared a love of being in nature, bushwalking and mountain biking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It felt just right,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Justin writes in Fighting Fate, his memoir, completed despite total paralysis, using eye tracking software. Today the barely detectable movement of one eye is the only means of communication between Rachel and Justin. And yet from this Rachel manages to include him in conversation as if it were the most normal of partner exchanges, with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you remember that, Justin?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd here and a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can I show \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 ?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd there, as if we were looking at holiday photo albums together. They have been a team for 31 years, during which Rachel says they have never had a fight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Annoyance, yes, disagreement yes, but never more than that,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says, laughing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Justin does not fight, he sees the bigger picture. When I met him I thought he was a mummy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boy and needed to toughen up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One bone of contention is that she thinks her name should be alongside Justin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on his book, as he could not have written it without her. She has a point. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I suggested that he include some of his dreams from his diary, and stories he had written for the family. And then I helped with the editing, which was very hard because when it came to all the science content, by then he could only say yes or no to my questions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The result, Fighting Fate, is an at times harrowing read, as Justin recounts death by death the numbing toll MND wreaks on his family, and the weight of responsibility he puts on his shoulders to find a cure. There is the dread of waiting for MND, the terror of wondering if his own decline was imminent, and there is the love that sustains him through it. He writes: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have lost count of all the times when Rachel has advocated for me, fought for me, protected me, comforted me and saved my life in both a physical and emotional sense. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rachel is the hero of my story in so many ways. I wish I could be there for her in the same way. It breaks my heart that I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rachel has written her own memoir, as yet unpublished \u00e2\u20ac\u201c her version of a remarkable partnership. As well as revealing her own mounting dread and increasingly frequent nightmares that everyone around her would die of MND, it expands on her personal understanding of how immersion in nature \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in her case, preferably swimming with dolphins, a motif that recurs throughout the house and its ocean blue-painted walls \u00e2\u20ac\u201c can bring about a unique kind of solace and healing. She has had a long time to prepare for the inevitable. *** At 195cm in height, Justin Yerbury is a big presence in his wheelchair. He reclines between us, staring ahead, mouth open, on a ventilator, with Sunny, a toy poodle curled on his lap, chosen because he is light enough not to cause Justin discomfort while helping with temperature regulation. We are in the lounge room of their suburban home on the outskirts of Wollongong, not far from where Justin was born, went to school and fulfilled his dream of playing professional basketball for the Illawarra Hawks. It is within what used to be easy reach of the department of molecular biology at the University of Wollongong, where he ran a team of 17 doing world-leading, pioneering research into a cure for the disease which has ravaged generations of his family. It first took the lives of his uncle and cousin, then, in 2002, in the space of six weeks, his mother, aunt and grandmother. His sister Sarah died of it a few years later. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We all had a sense that MND had rounded us up and was picking us off one by one,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he writes. Rachel apologises that the room needs to be kept dark and cool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c dark, because light strains Justin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already damaged eyes painfully (having lost the ability to close them naturally, he had surgery to insert weights into his eyelids to help him sleep); cool, because the machines on which he depends require it for peak efficiency. There are 10 of them in all, sighing and blinking and puffing and emitting purified air and delivering drugs and doing all the things a healthy body should do on its own but this one, at not yet 50, no longer can. A carer sits in another room watching his heart monitor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He has to have eyes on him 24 hours a day,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Rachel, who has had to get used to sharing the family home with a permanent roster of a dozen helpers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We have a team leader who coordinates and manages all Justin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tests, interventions, allied health visitors and admin. In the early days I tried to do it all, when staff from agencies let us down or cancelled, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do it now. It takes four hours to get Justin up, washed and dressed.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After a couple of potentially fatal near-misses, local energy providers know that this house cannot afford a power cut under any circumstances and have a bypass arrangement in place. There is also a back-up generator on site for emergencies. Nothing is left to chance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We used to listen to music but now I need the house to be quiet so I can hear the slightest gurgle or alarm from his heart monitor,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Rachel, whose two daughters and their partners live nearby. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are always on edge, hyper-vigilant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Some of the equipment Justin depends on is beginning to fail, and is hard to replace. The Yerburys had to fight hard for his electric wheelchair, valued at $30,000, because \u00e2\u20ac\u0153initially the NDIS did not believe he would live long enough to justify the cost\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. (The average life span after an MND diagnosis is 27 months. Stephen Hawking, whom the Yerburys met while Justin was doing research in Cambridge, lived for more than five decades with the disease.) Justin has lived for seven years since being diagnosed. Rachel was not always the stoic she is today. When Justin had his suspicions and fears confirmed by diagnosis, Rachel says she \u00e2\u20ac\u0153howled like an animal. I keened. That lasted two years. Then I learned to compartmentalise. I could keep it together at work.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd There have been counsellors to assist, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153but actually writing my memoir is what has helped me the most, which is why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m calling it Accepting Fate,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says, laughing at the bitter irony of their contrasting titles. Somehow, amid all this, she managed to complete a PhD in psychology. Meanwhile, Justin was awarded Australian science\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest award, the Eureka prize, last yar. After Justin was diagnosed, the family travelled a lot to build up a memory bank of special places and shared adventures \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a safari in Africa, seeing the northern lights in Scandinavia, swimming with whales. Justin continued to ride his mountain bike, defying doctors orders for as long as possible. The couple have been watching Tim Winton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s series on Ningaloo on ABC TV. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we watch shows like Back to Nature\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Justin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heart rate would drop,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rachel says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It has the same effect as meditation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made peace with the situation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Rachel, looking directly at Justin as she speaks. Everything the couple have needed to say to each other has been said. There will be no launch event for the book, no public celebration of its publication, but the consolation that Justin knows that Fighting Fate is out in the world, spreading his message that a cure is within reach, even if not in time for him. Fighting Fate by Justin Yerbury is out on 13 June 2023 through Affirm Press.

He also dismissed the possibility of pardoning himself, telling the outlet: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do anything wrong.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd US law does not bar Trump from running while under indictment, nor would it block him if he was convicted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These are thugs and degenerates who are after me,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, continuing his use of inflammatory language to describe his opponents and extensive legal troubles. The defiant comments from Trump came two days after the US Department of Justice charged him with 37 criminal counts related to his mishandling of classified documents and obstructing the department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investigation into the matter. Trump, who is the leading contender in the Republican field aiming to snag the party nomination to fight Joe Biden for the White House, is the first former US president to face federal charges \u00e2\u20ac\u201c an extraordinary moment in American history. Trump has already started seizing on the charges to try an appeal to Republicans for support, holding them up as yet another example of the way that political rivals are trying to persecute him. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ridiculous and baseless indictment by the Biden administration\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weaponized department of injustice will go down as among the most horrific abuses of power in the history of our country,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said during a speech at the Georgia Republican party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s convention. He received an enthusiastic welcome at the event from supporters, the Associated Press reported. About 48% of Americans believe Trump should have been indicted over his handling of classified documents, according to a new ABC/Ipsos study, while 35% believe he should not have been. There is a significant partisan split in responses reflecting the US\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep divides: 86% of self-identified Democrats say he should have been indicted, while 67% of self-identified Republicans say he should not have. Trump leads a wide Republican presidential field fairly easily and most of his rivals have not used the indictment to attack him, a signal of the sway the former president still has over the Republican party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The weaponization of federal law enforcement represents a mortal threat to a free society.

Why so zealous in pursuing Trump yet so passive about Hillary or Hunter?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rightwing governor, Ron DeSantis, tweeted on Thursday. A day later, in a speech in North Carolina, DeSantis, who is seen as Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most serious rival, seemed a bit more willing to needle Trump, saying he would have been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153court-martialed in a New York minute\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if he had mishandled classified documents when he was a navy lawyer. DeSantis, who sits a distant second in the polls to Trump, was also endorsed by Oklahoma\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s governor, Kevin Stitt, this week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c his first gubernatorial endorsement in the race. Mike Pence, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former vice-president and another 2024 rival, said the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, should have to publicly explain the charges. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stop hiding behind the special counsel and stand before the American people and explain why this indictment went forward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said in a North Carolina speech on Saturday. Garland appointed a special counsel, Jack Smith, to oversee the case in November to ensure independence due to the political sensitivity of the matter. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I had hoped the Department of Justice would see its way clear to resolve these issues with the former president without moving forward with charges, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m deeply troubled to see this indictment move forward,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Pence said on Friday. Other 2024 candidates echoed those sentiments. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, also suggested the prosecution was political. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The American people are exhausted by the prosecutorial overreach, double standards, and vendetta politics,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she tweeted. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to move beyond the endless drama and distractions.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153scales are weighted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the US justice system and pledged to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153purge all of the injustices and impurities in our system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor who is running for president and has willingly criticized Trump, called the indictment \u00e2\u20ac\u0153devastating\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153evidence filled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on CNN on Friday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The bigger issue for our country is: is this the type of conduct that we want from someone who wants to be president of the United States?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson, also a sometimes vocal Trump critic running for president, called on Trump to drop out. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we see in the facts thus far is that he treated [the documents] like entertainment tools,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Staying in the race does a disservice to the office of presidency and to the country and to the important decision that we have to make.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump is expected to appear on Tuesday at 3pm at the federal courthouse in Miami for an arraignment. The Secret Service is reportedly determining a plan for transporting Trump to the courthouse for the appearance, which is likely to be a spectacle. The case will at least initially be overseen by Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who was rebuked by an appeals court for rulings favorable to the ex-president at an earlier point in the case. Trump already faces separate criminal charges in Manhattan over hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. More criminal charges could come this year from both the justice department and prosecutors in Atlanta related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Even Trump, who survived two impeachments while president and has avoided accountability nearly his entire career, seemed to acknowledge his mounting legal woes. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nobody wants to be indicted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he told Politico. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care that my poll numbers went up by a lot. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be indicted. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve never been indicted. I went through my whole life, now I get indicted every two months. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been political.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jun/11/world-test-championship-australia-india-ashes-england", "primaryCategory": "sport", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAshes define eras\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: Australia switch focus after easy India win in WTC final", "lead": "Pat Cummins has said he is preparing for an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcera-defining\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 few weeks after leading Australia to victory in the World Test Championship final", "author": "Simon Burnton at the Kia Oval", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T14:38:01Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764521", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/896e02c5fa14e600152e121fb30aaf8c32de78cb/0_170_4460_2676/500.jpg", "body": "Pat Cummins said he was preparing for an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153era-defining\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd few weeks after leading his Australia side to victory in the World Test Championship final just five days before the Ashes get under way at Edgbaston. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen it as one big tour with two huge titles to play for,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good to tick the first one off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This match featured the best teams of the past two years of Test cricket, Australia ultimately overwhelming India by 209 runs, with a fresh cycle about to get under way in Birmingham. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say whether we like it or not Ashes tend to define eras and teams,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cummins said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think the great thing about this final is we feel like we played awesome cricket for the last two years, so to be there at the end holding the trophy feels really well deserved.

That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the big question. But in a big event like this you need to have fair opportunities to both teams. You work hard for two years and then you only have one shot at it.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sport.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Intriguingly, Sharma hinted that he was ready to adopt a full Bazball approach to Test cricket. Asked if too many of India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s batters had been guilty of lapses of concentration in this game, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We told the boys to play freely, and if the ball is there to be hit then hit it. There were no lapses of concentration, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just that we want to play a different way. We want to do something different.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Asked if this was the end of a road for an ageing team, he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There will be some talks about what brand of cricket we want to play in the next two years, and who are the guys who can do it for us.

Having started the Covid-delayed autumn clay-court season with lofty hopes in her first year since graduating from high school, expectations were high. But in her final warmup event, the Italian Open, she endured a desperate, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traumatic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd defeat against Arantxa Rus, the world No 71, in the first round. Swiatek retreated back to Poland with her small team, where they held talks about her direction and progress. Doubt festered in her mind. When she arrived at Roland Garros, the then 18-year-old struggled through practice, unable to escape her negative spiral. Her mood was so low that she made a bet with her sports psychologist, Daria Abramowicz, to see if she could just get through one training session without any drama. Swiatek spent the days before the tournament questioning her future. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I remember just being on the Jean Bouin [Roland Garros practice courts] before the tournament, practising there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Swiatek said last month. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I literally had the talk with Daria if it makes sense to continue everything because I felt so bad. I felt like, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know, my expectations were just pretty high. I felt really bad on court. Always tense and stressed, even when I was practising.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Two weeks later Swiatek won the French Open aged 19, and ranked No 54. It was both her first grand slam title and her first tour level title, which she clinched by demolishing the field, losing only 28 games in seven matches and not coming close to conceding a set. As joyful as her first grand slam title was, Swiatek also struggled to wrap her mind around her transformation. It had taken place in the early days of the Covid pandemic, with just 1,000 spectators allowed on the grounds each day. The whole scenario felt strange. In the years since she has often described feeling that aspects of her first win were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coincidental\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She felt she needed to win the French Open again in order to confirm the victory. After recovering from a break down in the deciding set to defeat Karolina Muchova 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 in the final on Saturday, Swiatek is now a three-time champion in Paris and a four-time grand slam title winner at 22 years old. There are no remaining doubts about her greatness. While there are no guarantees for the future, the early years indicate she is on the path to a generational career. Her 28-2 (93%) Roland Garros record alone is astounding. Her career win-loss record is 248-61 (80%). An 80% win rate is the marker of sustained excellence. The manner of her win felt even more meaningful because of the fortitude required. Beyond Serena Williams, there have been few frontrunners as accomplished as Swiatek in recent years. She has mastered the art of tearing through draws and smothering opponents with her skills in attack and defence. Learning to become similarly effective when things turn against her and she finds herself in a dogfight has been a work in progress. Against Muchova, the way in which Swiatek locked down her game and struck her return of serve while trailing 4-3 in the third set was as spectacular as the many times she has crushed opponents with her vicious, heavy topspin forehand. The circumstances around each of Swiatek\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Roland Garros triumphs have been starkly different. After her teenage breakthrough in 2020, in 2022 she arrived under the intense pressure of her historic 37-match winning run, desperate to ensure it was not a slamless streak. This year she faced the challenge of following up her superb season and maintaining her spot at the top of her sport. Had Aryna Sabalenka merely matched her performance in Paris, she would have lost her No 1 ranking. A few hours after her latest victory, Swiatek sat down amongt a small circle of journalists for what may well become an annual casual post-victory chat. Even after her toughest grand slam final yet, she seemed far less drained by her achievement than in previous years, perhaps more prepared for what is to come next. After a short break she will begin her preparations for the grass-court season as she looks to become more comfortable on her worst surface, and to move closer to greatness by winning Wimbledon for the first time."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/11/nicola-sturgeon-arrestedquestioned-in-snp-finances-inquiry", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Nicola Sturgeon arrested in SNP finances inquiry", "lead": "Former Scottish first minister being interviewed \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcas a suspect\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as part of investigation into claims party misspent \u00c2\u00a3600,000 of donations", "author": "Severin Carrell and Libby Brooks", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T14:23:47Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764524", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/b5f19ae39f20503fcad08ddff40e15734d63bfc1/927_244_1692_1015/500.jpg", "body": "Nicola Sturgeon has been arrested and questioned by detectives investigating allegations of financial misconduct by the Scottish National party.

The force said that Police Scotland detectives were interviewing Sturgeon \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as a suspect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A spokesperson for Sturgeon said she had met the police by arrangement, in the knowledge that she would be arrested and interviewed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nicola Sturgeon has today, Sunday 11 June, by arrangement with Police Scotland, attended an interview where she was to be arrested and questioned in relation to Operation Branchform,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the spokesperson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Nicola has consistently said she would cooperate with the investigation if asked, and continues to do so.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her husband, Peter Murrell, the former chief executive of the SNP, was arrested at their home in Uddingston near Glasgow on 5 April after plainclothes officers arrived without warning. He was interviewed under caution for nearly 12 hours before being released without charge. The police searched their home and back garden, and also the SNP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s headquarters, under warrant, taking out boxes of documents and computers. A luxury motorhome parked outside Murrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s house in Fife was also seized and impounded by police, as part of their investigation. Colin Beattie MSP, then the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s treasurer, was arrested and questioned as part of the same inquiry on 18 April and also released later without charge, pending further investigation. In a statement issued at 2.28pm on Sunday, Police Scotland said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A 52-year-old woman has today, Sunday 11 June 2023, been arrested as a suspect in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the Scottish National party. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The woman is in custody and is being questioned by Police Scotland detectives. A report will be sent to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The matter is active for the purposes of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and the public are therefore advised to exercise caution if discussing it on social media. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As the investigation is ongoing we are unable to comment further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Sturgeon has repeatedly said she did not know of any wrongdoing with the SNP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s finances and has insisted that the \u00c2\u00a3600,000 in donations it received for a future independence referendum were dealt with correctly. Speaking to reporters at Holyrood in late April, Sturgeon also denied that the police inquiry had played a part in her decision to step down in February, after eight years as SNP leader and first minister. Describing her husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traumatic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153very difficult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I understand the view that some people might have, that I knew this was all about to unfold and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why I walked away. Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not have anticipated in my worst nightmares what would have unfolded over the past few weeks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Speaking earlier on Sunday morning on BBC One\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Humza Yousaf, Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s successor as first minister and SNP leader, said he could not comment on the police inquiry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I understand why you ask the question, [but] as first minister I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a really important duty not to be seen to prejudice or interfere in the live police investigation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Opposition leaders and an SNP MP, Angus MacNeil, the MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar, said Yousaf should now follow previous precedent by suspending Sturgeon from the party. Yousaf refused to suspend Murrell and Beattie after they were arrested, on the grounds that neither had been charged or convicted. MacNeil, an ally of Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s predecessor, Alex Salmond, tweeted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This soap opera has gone far enough, Nicola Sturgeon suspended others from the SNP for an awful lot less! Time for political distance until the investigation ends either way.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Craig Hoy, the chair of the Scottish Conservatives, said the SNP had suspended other MPs under police investigation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The SNP continue to be engulfed in murkiness and chaos. Humza Yousaf must now show some leadership and suspend his predecessor from the SNP,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hoy said. Earlier this month, Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief constable, Sir Iain Livingstone, defended the police investigation after Sturgeon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allies attacked the force for erecting large forensic tents outside the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home after Murrell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s arrest. Murray Foote, the SNP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former head of communications at Holyrood, told the Daily Record in early May the use of tents was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153grotesque circus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Livingstone said they were erected partly to protect the couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s privacy. He said the use of search warrants was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153proportionate and necessary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and that the arrest warrants had been cleared by a judge. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When we carry out the search, we will put processes in place that are proportionate and necessary to the action being carried out, and to the inquiry and its terms, and I am satisfied that the steps we have taken are proportionate and necessary,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Livingstone told the Sunday Times. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stating opinion or speculation without having the knowledge and information that exists is damaging \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 because it infringes the rights of individuals. Operation Branchform has integrity, it is expected to have rigour. If the operation had not been pursued, I would rightly have been accused of neglect of duty.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Senior police sources had earlier told the BBC that the force had consulted the National Crime Agency, a UK-wide agency in charge of investigating serious and organised crime, about its investigation as a form of external peer review of its lines of inquiry. According to one senior police source, such external reviews are generally carried out \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to check on the status, strategy and direction of an investigation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The source added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The review checks that the lines of inquiry are correct, that nothing has been missed, and that the rationale is proportionate and necessary.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/11/the-weeknd-review-etihad-stadium-manchester-after-hours-til-dawn", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "The Weeknd review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c spectacular voyage through post-apocalyptic pop", "lead": "With a fire-belching, robot-enhanced stage show and 33 songs dispatched in two hours, Abel Tesfaye turns his jaded libertine image inside out with good old-fashioned thrills", "author": "Alexis Petridis", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T14:18:23Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764526", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ccbbb3e6bdc74a0d14b1cb1e3d4ec00158f60945/0_205_4283_2568/500.jpg", "body": "The Weeknd\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2023 stadium tour \u00e2\u20ac\u201c postponed so many times that its title features not just the name of his most recent album, Dawn FM, but its 2020 predecessor, After Hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is nothing if not spectacular. The set is a vast metallic cityscape, filled with ruined landmarks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c St Paul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cathedral, Toronto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CN Tower and the Empire State Building among them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which belch out fire or shoot violet-coloured lasers above the crowd at strategic moments. But most of the action takes place on a runway that stretches nearly the full length of the Etihad Stadium\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pitch, which also belches out fire at strategic moments, and comes illuminated by dozens of spotlights that either point skywards or focus on the audience, illuminating huge sections of the stands, which are already illuminated by the crowd themselves, equipped with Coldplay-inspired flashing wristbands on arrival. The walkway is decorated with an immense moon dangling over its far end and an even more immense model of the Hajime Sorayama-designed robot featured in the video for 2011\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Echoes of Silence. The song doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feature in the setlist, but no matter: the model slowly rotates, shoots coloured lights from its eyes, and provides a focal point around which dancers, clad in white robes and veils that look not unlike Tuareg tagelmusts, move in slow concentric circles. All this is intended to represent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a journey through a cosmic cataclysm that has erupted and plagued the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Coupled with the speed at which the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tracks are dispatched \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they are truncated and segue into each other, which enables the Weeknd to cram a staggering 33 songs into just under two hours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot to take in, although apparently not enough to distract at least one fan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attention from what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in the Ataturk Stadium. He spends virtually the entire gig glued to coverage of the Champions League final on his mobile, blind to any cosmic cataclysm that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t involve City failing to win the treble. He obviously goes home happy, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard not to feel that he has missed out. The concept is pretty opaque \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a clue what was supposed to be going on up there unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d read the advance publicity \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the relentlessness of its visual and aural bombardment is impressively beguiling. On stage, Abel Tesfaye is a noticeably sweeter but less charismatic figure than you might expect. He spends the show\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first half performing with his face concealed by an MF Doom-style metallic mask, but proves surprisingly big on the kind of old-fashioned rabble-rousing that involves claiming that one half of the audience is his favourite, then changing his mind when the other half cheers louder and asking them if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re ready to go home yet when the show is barely halfway through. Mask or not, the air of darkly brooding mystery projected by his videos is punctured slightly by the sight of him enthusiastically playing air guitar, and at one point air keyboards, during solos. For a man who has spent the past 13 years inhabiting the persona of a creepily decadent but conflicted libertine, big on auto-erotic asphyxiation, punishing cocaine binges, abusive relationships and wilfully hollow materialism (The Morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chorus of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the money is the motive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is an impressively cynical line with which to provoke a heartfelt audience singalong), he cuts a surprisingly cuddly figure on stage. But perhaps that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a persona he is tiring of. Tesfaye has been making noises about this being his final tour, at least as the Weeknd. He has said stuff like that before, but if it is the end of an era, the show acts both as a perfect summation and an impressive way to bow out. The setlist is expansive enough to reach back to his earliest work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Siouxsie and the Banshees-fuelled lurch of House of Balloons sounds fantastic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even pay a passing visit to 2013\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Kiss Land, the relative flop that nearly derailed his career entirely. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re struck by how varied his work has been: the woozy, weary balladry of Often is dramatically different to the neon-hued pop of Blinding Lights and Less Than Zero, the latter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chorus sounding positively Abba-esque as it booms around the stadium. But you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re also struck by how well it fits when crammed together cheek-by-jowl. The segues feel seamless, the shifts in temperature never jar \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all held together by a sharp melodic sense that means even the cloudiest tracks never feel as if they are they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re rambling. If this is a kind of retirement party for said persona, then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a euphorically celebratory one: even those punters whose enjoyment of the evening isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t predicated on City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance in Turkey leave looking thrilled. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 At London Stadium on 7 and 8 July, and Wembley on 18 August."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/11/inter-champions-league-final-manchester-city", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Proud Inter see Champions League final defeat as start of a journey | Nicky Bandini", "lead": "Reaching the Champions League final has strengthened Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing and their performance hints at a bright future despite summer obstacles", "author": "Nicky Bandini", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T14:10:05Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764528", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0d602c7ff0f8e55140d2491f95451f1379ecbae4/0_249_6000_3600/500.jpg", "body": "As Internazionale waited to collect their Champions League runners-up medals at the Ataturk Stadium on Saturday night, Andr\u00c3\u00a9 Onana hurled down his gloves and grabbed Lautaro Mart\u00c3\u00adnez by the face. It was not immediately clear if the goalkeeper was consoling his teammate or chastising him, the forceful body language reflecting all at once Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s despair at chances missed against Manchester City and their pride for having earned them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I told him football is like this, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard and unfair,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Onana said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But we played a great game, and we will be back. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to swallow, but working like this we will get back to another final.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd All around them, teammates were struggling to process the emotions. Inter played the game they had intended to, standing toe\u00e2\u20ac\u2018to\u00e2\u20ac\u2018toe with a City team who entered as heavy favourites, ceding possession but not position as they pressed and disrupted up the pitch. They carved out the better chances as well. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The ball just wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go in,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Federico Dimarco, who saw one header come back off the crossbar and another off the shin of his teammate Romelu Lukaku. A point-blank effort from the Belgian was kept out by Ederson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s knee. The penultimate touch of the game belonged to the City goalkeeper, making a brilliant save to deny Robin Gosens at a corner. Winning finals requires good fortune and better timing to combine with talent and hard work. Pep Guardiola was not bluffing when he told the Italian broadcaster Mediaset that the truest achievement was not to win this competition but to make a habit of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153always being there at the end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Inter want to believe this is only a starting point. The midfielder Nicol\u00c3\u00b2 Barella said last week that the path to Istanbul had begun with defeat by Sevilla in the 2020 Europa League final and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153from that pain we started to win trophies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They secured a Serie A title the next season under Antonio Conte. They have since claimed the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana twice each with Simone Inzaghi. The sense of momentum is real. Inter had not reached the Champions League knockout stage in a decade before Inzaghi took charge, and he pointed to the last-16 defeat by Liverpool last year as another crucial step in their development, a 1-0 win in the second leg at Anfield representing a moment when his team began to understand what was required. How high can you build, though, on uncertain foundations? Inter are facing up to another summer of difficult decisions as they attempt to balance the books. The club posted losses of more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac245m (\u00c2\u00a3209m) in 2021, then \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140m in 2022. From 2024 they will enter into a three\u00e2\u20ac\u2018year monitoring period of their financial fair play settlement agreement with Uefa, during which their aggregate football earnings deficit must not exceed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60m. Reaching the Champions League final this season has strengthened their position, bringing in close to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100m in prize money as well as additional gate receipts and a last\u00e2\u20ac\u2018minute shirt sponsorship deal with Paramount. Yet Inter, who are due in 2024 to repay a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac275m emergency loan from Oaktree Capital taken out to cover post\u00e2\u20ac\u2018pandemic operating costs, still need further steps to break even. At least one high earner can be subtracted from the wage bill, with Milan Skriniar out of contract and headed for Paris Saint-Germain, but others whose deals expire this month present the club with dilemmas. Edin Dzeko is 37 years old and wanted by Fenerbahce, but he played a central role in Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s run to this final. If he leaves, then who starts up front with Mart\u00c3\u00adnez next season? Inter would love to extend Lukaku\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loan from Chelsea, and the player wants to stay, but once again the financial realities are complicated. It is only two years since the Premier League club paid \u00c2\u00a397.5m to sign him from Inter in the first place. Inter may need to consider another high-profile sale. The most obvious candidate is Onana, who joined on a free transfer from Ajax last summer and who raised his profile with an impressive performance in Istanbul. He already kept five clean sheets in six knockout games to get there. That would be a painful sale, though, for a club striving to build on their success. Onana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s introduction to the starting lineup this season was a turning point, after a shaky start with Samir Handanovic in goal. He hardly sounded like a man rushing for the exit on Saturday when he said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am at Inter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disposal. I will do what Inter tell me to do but I am happy at Inter.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The club president, Steven Zhang, was struggling to contain his emotions at full time on Saturday, heaping praise on his team and insisting \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the players who had a good season with us will continue with us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Inzaghi, who has one year left on his contract, said he would take a few days before getting together with club leadership to discuss the next steps. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With this spirit, organisation and edge to our game I am sure we will be back to play another Champions League final,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the manager said, echoing the sentiments of Onana and others besides. Inter believe they are still at the start of a journey, not the end of one. There are major obstacles to be navigated, though, on the road ahead."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/jun/11/modernisation-creeps-on-as-london-gentlemens-clubs-open-to-women", "primaryCategory": "uk-news", "title": "Modernisation creeps on as London gentlemen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clubs open to women", "lead": "Pratt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is the latest establishment haunt to allow female members but others are still resistant to change", "author": "Amelia Gentleman", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T14:02:48Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764530", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/ee3d329bb59c569e11b587d5332787dc372de73f/0_342_7952_4774/500.jpg", "body": "Mild signs of a potential willingness to modernise have been observed in some of central London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s establishment clubs in the past few weeks, led by the announcement that, after a wait of 166 years, women will finally be allowed to become members of Pratt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. The decision by the owner of Pratt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s has been met mostly with resigned acceptance by the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership, which includes at least a dozen MPs, and has triggered renewed discussion of possible reform at the remaining hardcore handful of gentlemen\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clubs that refuse to admit women. Members of the Beefsteak, another men-only dining club joined by MPs, actors and judges, believe it is now likely it will also be obliged to change its rules to admit women. A renewed drive by female campaigners was launched last week to persuade members of the Garrick, including Michael Gove and the actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Hugh Bonneville, to allow women to join. Meanwhile, at the Athenaeum (which has allowed women as members since 2002) an organised movement by about 70 members to block further modernising changes was rejected at last Monday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s annual general meeting, with an intervention from Theresa May, who shut down discussion of a series of motions aimed at preserving the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153traditional ethos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The need for reform is being felt at many of London\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Pall Mall clubs, despite their reputation as outposts of an unchanging Britain frozen somewhere in the 1950s, partly because rising food and energy prices have brought cost of living issues to the attention of members of clubs located in old, draughty buildings with high overheads. Changes at Pratt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u201c where the current and former Conservative MPs Kwasi Kwarteng, Nicholas Soames and Hugo Swire are members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c were brought in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153with immediate effect\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owner, the Earl of Burlington, William Cavendish, without consultation in late May. However, there will probably not be any perceptible change to membership in the near future, because the process of proposing and seconding new members takes considerable time, requiring 25 people to support a nomination by writing their names in a book in the club and later committee approval. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There has been chuntering, people saying, hmm we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like this, complaining that they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consulted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a Pratt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s member said, but he added that younger members were beginning to feel belatedly that the status quo was indefensible. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a feeling that the legal grounds for these places to be all male is quite shaky.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Emily Bendell, the founder of a clothes business who has been campaigning for the Garrick to change its rules to admit women, wrote last week to a handful of the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most prominent members, noting that eight years had passed since 50.5% of the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s membership voted in favour of women members, a vote that fell short of the required two-thirds majority needed for rule change. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A second vote is long overdue,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she wrote. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you would not be a member of a club that excluded members on the basis of race, religion or sexuality, so we urge you to call for a new vote to allow female members at the Garrick.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her campaign has been met with bemusement by some (mostly male) commentators who question the need to fight for equality at a tiny group of elite institutions, but she argues that the existence of men-only clubs that have senior male lawyers and politicians as members \u00e2\u20ac\u0153negatively impacts women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s professional advancement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Last week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s failed attempt by a splinter faction of Athenaeum members to resist modernising changes to the club centred on a desire to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153restore quiet harmony\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Its failure suggested most members recognised that reform was necessary. A new sub-group within the club, named the 1824 group (the year the club was founded), sent a letter to fellow members protesting that: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We sense that the traditional ethos of our club is step by step being eroded and moving towards something which appears more like a corporate run facilities-based hotel/restaurant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The former prime minister Theresa May, who like her husband, Philip May, is an Athenaeum member, intervened with a procedural motion, blocking discussion of all motions proposed by the 1824 group, according to the historian Felipe Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez-Armesto, who was one of the 1824 group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s organisers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was literally shouted down,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We were trying to enshrine the perception of the club not as a business, but as a meeting place of intellectuals. A lot of us have become very dissatisfied very recently because the club is being driven at a furious pace towards incorporation as a business. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a commercialisation happening across clubland,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Fern\u00c3\u00a1ndez-Armesto added. The Travellers Club (which has diplomats among its members), White\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (which has never allowed women inside the building, with the occasional exception of the late Queen Elizabeth II), Brooks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Boodle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all remain resistant to admitting women. Even at clubs that chose to let women in decades ago, the proportion of female members remains low. Although the Athenaeum began admitting women 21 years only, its membership remains overwhelmingly male; only 28% of the club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 147 new members were women in 2022-23, only 7% were under 40 and only two new members were under 30."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/jun/11/the-marvels-of-marrakech-15-tips-for-a-perfect-break-in-the-moroccan-city", "primaryCategory": "travel", "title": "Marvellous Marrakech: finding your way around the maze of Morocco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gem", "lead": "Famous for its vibrant colour and intoxicating culture, this ancient city has something for all the senses.

For a hidden oasis\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The secret garden A remarkable newly restored garden, Le Jardin Secret was the site of one of the largest riads in the medina, belonging to the chancellor of Sultan Moulay Abd al-Hafid, the last sultan of Morocco before the French protectorate. By 1934 it had fallen into disrepair. It reopened in 2016 with gardens designed by the British gardening architect Tom Stuart-Smith. Split into an exotic garden and an Islamic garden (laid out according to strict geometrical rules), it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a place of sublime beauty and peace.

After the Second World War the palace doors were closed and for 60 years it was shuttered. In 2017, it came back to life as the Museum of Cultural Confluences, where visitors can explore Morocco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rich cultural heritage. Once the residence of the Marrakech pasha, Thami El Glaoui, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s awash with zellige (colourful geometric tilework) and the central courtyard is filled with fountains and orange trees.

There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an opulent pink-marbled spa with a plunge pool and hammam, while the bedrooms are equally fabulous; some have an internal balcony with idyllic views of the turquoise pool below, framed with palms and pretty white sunbeds.

For museum chic\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Mus\u00c3\u00a9e Yves St Laurent Yves Saint Laurent visited Marrakech in 1966 and the Red City was undoubtedly a primary influence on his designs for the next 40 years.

For stunning interiors\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 El Fenn hotel The magic starts as you step from the dusty street through a giant wooden door into El Fenn, a stunning hotel in the heart of Marrakech. Cats snooze on velvet chairs near the reception, and in winter a fire blazes. Each room is individually designed, some have stained glass, others have rolltop baths beside the fireplace. Breakfast on the roof terrace is not to be rushed: feast on Moroccan crumpets with honey, creamy eggs, shakshuka and pastries as you gaze over the city to the Koutoubia mosque. By day, laze next to one of the pools on a day bed or striped lounger. The rooftop bar and restaurant is a chilled place to hang out (and is open to non-residents). In the tiled downstairs patio, you can get mint tea and cake. Around every corner is an artwork to gaze at, and a luxurious nook or hammock to curl up in. After all that exertion, you may like to relax at night, sipping cocktails by candlelight to a cool music beat.

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all aware that we probably should be re-applying the factor 50 more often than we do, especially after swimming, but does the state of the ozone layer make things worse? Is the sun somehow \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 hotter now? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The most fundamental thing to understand is that sun exposure without use of high-factor sunscreen or protective clothing is a health hazard,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Dr Derrick Phillips, consultant dermatologist and spokesperson for the British Skin Foundation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Cumulative sun exposure over a lifetime damages skin proteins and cellular DNA, causing mutations and increasing the risk of developing skin cancers. Also, the skin becomes less effective at repairing damaged DNA over time. There is currently no way of reversing cumulative DNA damage, and so past sun exposure determines your present risk of skin cancer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re exposed to two forms of ultraviolet radiation from the sun: UVA and UVB. UVA can penetrate clouds and window glass, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still a concern if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in the office, or there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a brief break in the direct glare on a scorching day. UVB peaks during the summer months, and is especially dangerous when the sun is high in the sky around midday, or in areas where the ozone layer is thin, like Australia. It can directly damage the DNA of skin cells, causing mutations and leading to cell death and inflammation. UVA is present all year round, penetrates deeper into the skin and damages the collagen and elastin that keep it looking springy and youthful. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153UVA is responsible for 80% of the signs of skin ageing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fine lines, wrinkles and pigmentation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Phillips. Both are carcinogenic, but UVB is worse. Short exposure can cause mutations that lead to the development of melanoma, while long-term cumulative exposure is associated with non-melanoma skin cancers that tend to occur later on in life. Oh, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not just the carcinogenic effects you need to worry about. Scientists are starting to understand that excess UV exposure can lead to a raft of other negative effects, including a weakened immune system. So far, so depressing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also worth noting that fair skin, red hair and freckles do increase your susceptibility to the sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s radiation, as does a family history of skin cancer. So what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the solution? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sunscreen protects the skin from the harmful effects of UV radiation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Phillips. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It should really be applied to exposed sites all year round, but particularly during the summer months and on sunny holidays. Studies have shown that most people do not apply enough sunscreen to get the level of protection on the label. To keep your family safe, we recommend using a sunscreen with at least SPF30 and 5-star UVA protection. It should be applied every two hours and more frequently if you are swimming, or performing any activities that will cause you to sweat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In other words, follow the instructions on the bottle, and do it before you go out, as it can take 15 minutes to be absorbed into the skin. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re relying on your clothes to protect you, consider what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re wearing: tight weaves like cotton offer excellent protection, while loose weaves are more easily penetrated. The Skin Cancer Foundation advises that more intensely coloured clothes offer better protection as they prevent more rays from getting to you. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re caught without your factor 50 in the beer garden, consider having a fruity mocktail: one small-scale study suggests that alcohol actually increases the risk of sunburn while vitamins C and E together seem to offer a slight protective effect. Finally, there really is one good reason to stuff an old airport paperback in your suitcase, rather than bringing a tablet to read on holiday: the latter can actually reflect the sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s UV rays back into you, giving you a higher dose than normal. Oh, and you probably shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be using a sunbed under any circumstances. But the Divine Comedy never wrote a song about those anyway."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/11/amaarae-fountain-baby-review-sexy-sparkling-dream-pop", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "Amaarae: Fountain Baby review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c sexy, sparkling dream pop", "lead": "Drawing on a whole world of sounds, the Ghanaian American\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second album proper is a summery delight", "author": "Tara Joshi", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T14:00:53Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764535", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/d25976a184d9ebca9706fd40e790aafccc0a95cb/0_1054_4000_2400/500.jpg", "body": "While the potential of a truly global post-internet pop is something that has felt increasingly realised of late, few artists are doing it like Amaarae.

The family-owned Timpson Group includes Snappy Snaps, Johnsons dry cleaners and a small group of pubs alongside its namesake shoe-repair and key-cutting business. It doubled comparable profits to \u00c2\u00a336.5m in the year to 1 October 2022 and sales rose to \u00c2\u00a3297.4m, up about 40%. Sir John Timpson, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair, who took the business from shoe shops into services, said sales of key cutting, watch repair and photo processing had all bounced back after being hit during lockdowns when \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no one was going to work, parties or getting married.

Car-key cutting is one of the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fastest-growing businesses. However, Timpson bemoaned the fact that shoe repairs had not seen a similar revival because of the surge in popularity of trainers during the pandemic. The service has been in long-term decline because of competition from cheap footwear and the switch to more casual dressing.

Timpson Group is also expanding into vending machines that offer simple key-cutting and photo ID.

Both sides are pointing the finger of blame at the other for the confusion that has led to two byelections being triggered by those who lost out on being elevated to the Lords. What was Johnson pushing for? In an attempt to reward those who helped him in Downing Street, Johnson put forward at least 16 aides, colleagues and friends for peerages. He was entitled to do this, and the resignation honours list is something other outgoing prime ministers have previously used to decorate those who remained with them until the bitter end. It had been widely reported for months that among those to be rewarded were four sitting Conservative MPs: the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack; the former Cop26 president Alok Sharma; Nigel Adams, a backroom operator who held a roving Cabinet Office brief; and the ex-culture secretary Nadine Dorries. But there was a curious delay to the list being approved. Why the hold-up? Initially, the delay was attributed to the large size of Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s honours list. The peerages were dealt with in tandem with other titles Johnson wanted to bestow on his close friends and confidantes. It took time for the government to whittle down Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initial controversial proposals, a process that reportedly included the removal of a knighthood for his father, Stanley. Meanwhile, the House of Lords Appointments Commission began vetting the names of the people to whom Johnson wanted to hand peerages and the lifetime lawmaking powers that go with the position. The commission ruled that it would not be possible for the four Tory MPs nominated to hold on to their seats and move to parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upper house at the next election. They either had to commit to standing down from the Commons and joining the Lords within six months, or face being left off the list. Jack confirmed he would not step down early, ruling him out. How did Johnson try to break the deadlock? Johnson pushed for a rare face-to-face meeting with the prime minister to discuss peerages, which was granted on 2 June. Wary about the impending findings of an inquiry by the Commons privileges committee into claims he misled MPs over Partygate, which could have resulted in a byelection he was at risk of losing, he urged Sunak to act quickly. There were only three people in the room and accounts of what happened vary. It appears that Johnson came away from the meeting believing he had been given assurances his list of proposed peerages would be approved. But Downing Street insiders have suggested Sunak gave no such cast iron guarantee, and instead merely signalled his intention to simply sign off on the approved list that came back from the appointments commission. Why did the final list trigger such chaos? In the end, only eight peerages were accepted by the commission, and the names of those who had been cleared to join the Lords was published on Friday. In a highly unusual move, No 10 declassified the list it got back from the commission in February. This was to show that Sunak had not removed any names and that any omissions were not his doing. As well as the seven names announced, there was an eighth \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although it was redacted. No 10 said the person withdrew for personal reasons. So what happened to the missing names? The commission decided during vetting not to approve some of the people on the list. Its role, after all, is not to wave every request through but to evaluate nominations for life peers to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ensure the highest standards of propriety\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It appears that Dorries, Adams and Sharma had been under the impression for months they would be on the final list. But it has become clear now that in order to join the Lords, they were meant to have either quit the Commons already or informed the commission they were planning to do so. There may also have been further propriety concerns. For instance, some argued Dorries should not be given a peerage after \u00e2\u20ac\u0153showing a contempt for parliamentary process\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by repeatedly disparaging the privileges committee. Additional claims have been raised by Johnson allies that Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team may have quietly watered down the list before it was sent to the commission. Grant Shapps, the energy secretary, said on Sunday: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As far as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m aware, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The row threatens to further erode relations in what is an already acrimonious Conservative party. Dorries and Adams have quit the Commons, triggering the very byelections Sunak was keen not to cause by giving them peerages in the first place. Hannah White, the director of the Institute for Government, said the revelation that about 50% of those proposed for peerages were rejected by the commission \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well above the previous average of about 10% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153further cement [Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s] reputation for constitutional recklessness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/11/boris-johnson-britain-donald-trump-parliament-democracy", "primaryCategory": "commentisfree", "title": "Farewell, Boris Johnson: Britain will not miss your attempts to play Trump  | Simon Jenkins", "lead": "His era in power was marked by squalor and self-promotion.

Again. Ducking and swerving, crashing and picking himself up, Boris Johnson is a political wrecker. He smashed David Cameron\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leadership with his mendacious Brexit campaign, and then retuned it to smash Theresa May. When he won and reached Downing Street, he made it a music-hall turn. The government was reduced to a shambles over Partygate, and was found to have broken the law during lockdown. Like any talented comedian, Johnson can well command a public stage. His is a likable personality whose performances are amusing to those who find most politicians tedious and the spectacle of politics dull. But out of sight, Johnson is a mess quite unsuited to high office. He brought discredit to Downing Street in the eyes of the world, and those who worked with him and knew him best told him a year ago that he had to stand down. Johnson is in a line of populist mavericks who have found themselves at odds with the core institution of British democracy and parliament. He has now resigned his seat, murmuring that this is only \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for now\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. His resignation statement was issued over the heads of his fellow MPs in a grievance trope that portrayed himself as victim of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153political hit job \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a witch-hunt \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a kangaroo court\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The tactic works for Trump because Americans love to hate Washington. It is far less clear that the adoring shires, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153red wall\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and floating voters will join Johnson in his march on Westminster. Will they really smash the windows and send Mr Speaker quivering under his chair? There was no ounce of contrition in Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statement. Even by his own reckless standards, it read like a late-night rant which should have carried a Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Press Send warning. The language was mean-spirited, chippy and mendacious. At a time of acute delicacy in the Tory party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standing, it was deeply disloyal to its leadership \u00e2\u20ac\u201c precisely the accusation he levelled at Rishi Sunak for resigning as his chancellor. For Johnson to accuse anyone of disloyalty is monumental hypocrisy, given how he treated Cameron and May. The privileges committee judgment appears from first reports to be unequivocal, even if its preparation was far too dilatory. At the start, Johnson had professed himself content with its hearing. Now that it has presumably found he misled parliament, his depiction of it as a Labour-dominated, anti-Brexit conspiracy is ridiculous. Its seven members have a Tory majority, two of whom are Brexiteer Tories, Sir Bernard Jenkin and Sir Charles Walker. Johnson accuses them of being \u00e2\u20ac\u0153undemocratic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but their verdict goes to parliament, and it was for parliament to decide what should happen next. Johnson could have appealed to his fellow MPs, a majority of them Tories. If they in turn suspended him, he could have appealed to his constituents for reselection and re-election. The process is laboriously democratic. The truth is that Johnson was afraid of democracy. He feared his constituents, not parliament. He cut and ran. Even in doing so, Johnson confirmed the worst suspicions of his critics and those who feel his era in politics has been seized by a corrupt and ritualised squalor. He scattered in his wake a trail of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honours\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to scores of his most loyal courtiers, irrespective of their merits. All of them \u00e2\u20ac\u201c from Priti Patel to Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s former hairdresser \u00e2\u20ac\u201c apparently deserved the thanks of the nation. Seven will be given life membership of parliament as peers, with a corresponding income to match. This is a parody of politics. Will it never stop? A possible early return for Johnson appears to have been plotted between him and his chief supporter, Nadine Dorries. She resigned her Mid Bedfordshire seat in an obscure deal surrounding her failure to get a peerage. This would involve Rishi Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team having to decide whether Johnson merits Tory sponsorship. This would be bizarre, with his current behaviour so clearly aimed at undermining the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances at the next election. Sunak\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s authority could not survive granting Johnson this opportunity. At the very least, a two-election expulsion would seem appropriate. This is the moment when egocentric politicians toy with the idea of going independent, even founding their own party. Johnson could finance it from his grievance memoirs and, like Enoch Powell and Nigel Farage, become a nagging wound on the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s political fringe. But such ventures always end in ignominy. Johnson is by now a Marmite attraction. Besides, Powell and Farage had serious policies to champion. Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only policy is self-promotion. Britain is not a populist democracy, but a parliamentary one. These are quite different concepts. Parliament is in place to discipline the popular will to the realities and necessities of power. Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most publicised faults were committed in Downing Street, resulting from what his biographer Anthony Seldon called in the Sunday Times an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inner emptiness \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 a total absence of moral compass\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The faults for which he has fallen were not in power but in his handling of parliament. He may have survived the breaking of lockdown law. He may have apologised to the public and the monarch. But lying to parliament was tantamount to lying to the people in the one place where their representatives should hold power to account. The content of the lie is not the issue. The issue is the fact of its existence. From the moment Johnson came to power, his attitude to parliament was orchestrated by ethically neutered aides imported by him into Downing Street. He sacked the abler half of the existing cabinet on suspicion of disloyalty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a contempt for his parliamentary party Margaret Thatcher never showed. In 2019, he tried to suspend parliament and had to be called to order by the supreme court. He defied parliament\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regulation of ministerial conduct in the Priti Patel and Owen Paterson affairs. Partygate was merely the last straw. Johnson failed what the historian Lord Hennessy calls the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153good chaps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd test of constitutional behaviour. This holds that Britain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unwritten constitution is underpinned by unspoken protocols of honesty, courtesy and compromise. Compared with other world assemblies, these conventions have guided parliament down the ages, steering clear of revolutions, anarchies and mob rule. The constitution has been sorely tested in recent years, but it has contrived to eject three poor leaders from Downing Street in just three. It took the US constitution four years to dispose of just one, and he may yet return. Johnson insulted parliament. Its members are most unlikely to forgive him. He is surely best advised to do what he does best: retire profitably, and entertain the world from the sidelines.

The singer-songwriter hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t headlined a concert in more than a decade when, in 2015, she survived a brain aneurysm and lost the ability to walk and talk. But seven years later \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after what her friend Brandi Carlile called a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153magical transformation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she took the stage again in a surprise performance at the Newport folk festival, joined by Carlile and other musicians. Afterwards, according to Carlile, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Joni said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI want to do another show.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd And so, on Saturday evening in rural Washington state, Mitchell played her first headline show in 23 years. The venue was the Gorge Amphitheatre, a stunning venue whose stage is set against a backdrop of dramatic cliffs overlooking the Columbia River. For the Joni devotees in attendance, reaching this natural cathedral \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nearly three hours\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 drive from Seattle \u00e2\u20ac\u201c required a pilgrimage of sorts. But that was no obstacle. Among the younger attenders in a crowd that spanned the generations was Sasha Wachtel, who had come from Los Angeles. Mitchell \u00e2\u20ac\u0153has been my main and pretty much only musical hero for many, many years\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just remember listening to Hejira when I was driving across the country when I was 21 and realising what the songs were about, the incredible depth of the songwriting and the layers of meaning \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and just thinking: the woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fucking genius.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dennis Brice travelled from Philadelphia for the show, where he was joined by his brother, Paul, who had flown from London. Brice, a priest, had seen Mitchell before \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at the Newport folk festival in 1969 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and now he was celebrating his 75th birthday. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Joni was often in our sermons, because of the way she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interfaced with culture and thinking and life: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve looked at life from both sides now, win or lose, I still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know anything,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said, paraphrasing her 1969 song Both Sides, Now. Barbara Olson, 61, had travelled from Florida. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When I think about what she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been through \u00e2\u20ac\u201c she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s learned to walk three times in her life,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Olson said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If she sings \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve looked at life from both sides now\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 tonight, I am going to lay on the ground, and then I can die.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Given the lofty place she occupies in the minds of her listeners, this comeback performance might have been a stately and solemn affair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but Mitchell herself, who beams as she takes the stage and appears slightly tickled by the admiration, ensured that it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. The concert is part of Carlile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s weekend festival at the Gorge. Mitchell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance, as Carlile explained, is modelled after the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Joni Jams\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Mitchell hosts at her LA home, where musicians from Paul McCartney to Chaka Khan to Harry Styles routinely gather. The intent on Saturday, Carlile told the audience of 27,000, is to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153invite you into the living room\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Thus the stage is set with a bottle of pinot grigio, a table topped with framed pet photos, and an array of couches and chairs occupied by a band full of musical luminaries, including Annie Lennox, Sarah McLachlan and Marcus Mumford. Carlile acts as a sort of informal MC while Mitchell, seated at the front and carrying a cane adorned with a small bear\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head, plays the role of storyteller during a remarkable three-hour performance. With her vocal range far more limited than it once was, her singing feels conversational, as though she is relaying wisdom gained from her 79 years. Though the stories her songs told were all true, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not all my stories,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she says. She also tells tales from her career. The last time she was at the Gorge, she said, she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been touring with Bob Dylan and Van Morrison and forgotten the words to a verse of Dylan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, so she made one up. Morrison thought that was rude, but Mitchell disagreed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Dylan loved it, she says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing he likes better than to see me fuck up.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While Mitchell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s range is smaller, her voice hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lost its power \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nor her familiar slow vibrato. This is on particular display in songs like Both Sides, Now and Gershwin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Summertime, which she sings mostly solo, with instrumental accompaniment. Other songs feature Mitchell and fellow performers sharing the lead vocals, sometimes in unison, sometimes crossing over each other, slightly out of sync. This brings an improvisational liveliness to songs including A Case of You, which receives a standing ovation from the audience and the performers alike. Her own performances are interspersed with covers of Mitchell songs by others on stage, often prefaced by short speeches describing what her music meant to them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re such a visionary, such a legend, such an inspiration to all of us on the stage and everyone out there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lennox says before singing Ladies of the Canyon, which she describes as the song that inspired her career. Another is a potent rendition of Help Me, performed by the singer and guitarist Celisse, whom Mitchell calls \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the lady Jimi Hendrix\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Despite the heavy praise back and forth, Mitchell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance feels ego-free. She laughs and cracks jokes between songs and further extols the virtues of her fellow performers, never seeming to take the evening too seriously. That sets the tone for a joyful show, though the momentousness of the occasion leaves more than a few audience members \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and even some on stage \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tearful. For the encore, Mitchell picks up a guitar. It is surreal to see a legend who had barely been able to speak a few years earlier perform virtually solo, accompanying herself as she sang her song If, which she describes as one of her favourites. The lyrics offer hope to the listener, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153if you can draw a crowd and keep your virtue.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd As tens of thousands celebrate her, Mitchell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c whose wide appeal over the decades has never inhibited her consummate artistry \u00e2\u20ac\u201c might have been singing about herself."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/11/syracuse-multiple-people-shot-stabbed-hit-by-cars", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Syracuse incident leaves 13 people either shot, stabbed or hit by cars", "lead": "Shooting victims were three women and a man, while five women and one man had been stabbed, after gunfire erupts at gathering", "author": "Guardian staff", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T13:08:15Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764546", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/eaf70ca42983b5c08eef285f4fbbbd931e425378/0_361_5616_3370/500.jpg", "body": "A serious violent incident in Syracuse, New York, has left 13 people either shot, stabbed or hit by vehicles, police have said.

Women, individuals who are not white, and less educated people were most likely to report a change in their sexual identity. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We carried out this research because although we knew that sexual identity is fluid, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know just how fluid it is,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lead author, Prof Yang Hu of Lancaster University. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We also wanted to know how this fluidity varies across different demographic groups.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Almost 23,000 individuals were observed twice over six years by researchers from Lancaster University, using data from the United Kingdom household longitudinal study. Researchers found that a significant minority (6.6%) of the cohort had changed their reported sexual identity over that period. The study\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main findings show: Sexual identity mobility is higher among young people aged 16\u00e2\u20ac\u201c24 (7.9%) and older adults aged 65 and over (7.4%), compared with those aged 25\u00e2\u20ac\u201c64 (5.0%\u00e2\u20ac\u201c6.2%). Sexual identity mobility is 10% less likely among men (5.7%) than women (6.3%). Sexual identity mobility is three times more likely among non-white minority ethnic individuals (15.5%) than among white people (5.0%). Sexual identity mobility is more likely among less educated people. The rates of moving into and out of heterosexual identities are comparable. The research is published this week in Demography, the journal of the Population Association of America. Nicole Denier, of the University of Alberta in Canada and co-author of the report was particularly intrigued by the finding that sexual identity does not stabiliseover the life course. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That assumption has given rise to much research focusing on adolescence as a critical stage of sexual identity development,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But our findings suggest that changes in sexual identity represent an equally worthy research topic among the elderly and indeed across the full life span.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The research does not explore the reasons behind the changes in sexual identity but Hu hypothesised that people in middle life may be less likely to change their sexual identity because of pressure from the work environment and other social institutions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Existing theories suggest that rigid norms around \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmasculinity\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 may mean that men may be less flexible and fluid in their sexual identity expressions,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ethnic and racial minorities, and the less socioeconomically advantaged may be more susceptible to multiple forms of social pressure and minority stress, which may sway their identification and identity reports.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The research was welcomed by the LGBT Foundation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We hope that this research can challenge several societal assumptions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c [and raises awareness] that people can come out more than once, that this is common, and that this should be respected as part of someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s journey,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ibtisam Ahmed, head of policy and research. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This research also challenges one of the assumptions that is prevalent in mainstream media/society at the moment that LGBTQ+ people tend to be younger or that it is seen as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in young people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ahmed added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This research clearly highlights that coming out can and does happen at any stage of life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/11/readers-reply-if-shakespeare-wrote-for-the-masses-why-is-his-work-now-an-intellectual-preserve", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "title": "Readers reply: if Shakespeare wrote for the masses, why is his work now an intellectual preserve?

John Silvester, Sleaford Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Readers reply Shakespearean \u00e2\u20ac\u0153masses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were theatregoers. Nowadays, people are inundated with choices of sights to see and entertainments to hear: TV, billboards, movies, the internet, radio. Insofar as Shakespeare is studied as texts, his works require attentive readers who can concentrate; such readers are fewer than masses. Diane Hunter The masses did not read Shakespeare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plays, but enjoyed them in the theatre, which was affordable. Even today, the best view of the action at the Globe is from the courtyard, which has the cheapest seats. Unfortunately, Shakespeare has been sucked into an examination system in which pupils are graded according to what they write and are rarely taken to see an examination text on stage. In most schools, the only plays that they encounter are exam set texts and teachers stick to the same plays year after year. It used to be the practice to encounter a different play in each school year. Now, to know three plays is the experience of only those studying literature exams to A-level. Viv Graver Shakespeare wrote for the Elizabethan masses, who spoke the language he wrote and would have understood his plays in a linguistic and cultural context without need for explanations or endless footnotes. People nowadays are highly unlikely to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153get it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd first time round and are, understandably, often loathe to try again. couldBworse I cannot agree with the notion that he is now for an intellectual preserve. Many, many years ago, at four, I was taken to see A Midsummer Night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dream in an outdoors performance in Bury St Edmunds, in the rain, and laughed and laughed more than anything has made me laugh since. My younger daughter was brought up in a community on the Hudson Valley in New York, which had Shakespeare performances in a beautiful park, with the result that for every year of her childhood her eyes glistened with delight when she heard it was Shakespeare again. We were both enraptured by what we experienced; no intellectual thoughts here. As a young teen, my daughter came to the UK and said on coming back from her new school one day: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get these kids. They don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know Shakespeare.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I should say no more. Hector McDonnell It isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t; the works of Shakespeare continue to be widely popular, but the form has changed. Theatre is no longer the space in which popular entertainment takes place \u00e2\u20ac\u201c now it is on the big or small screen. As such, Shakespeare has moved to those media: a notable example is the film Romeo + Juliet, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, which was a phenomenal success \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and a direct adaptation of a work of Shakespeare on the big screen. But beyond direct adaptations are new works based on his material \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The Lion King, West Side Story, 10 Things I Hate About You and The King are all adaptations of Shakespeare plays created for a modern, popular audience. These new works allow audiences to appreciate these works in the popular media of today and in the language and context that is relevant or interesting to them. Why is the study of the texts an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153intellectual preserve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? To the extent that it is, it is only because studying any kind of literature is an intellectual preserve \u00e2\u20ac\u201c most people just want to appreciate, not study, and they want to appreciate it in a medium that they enjoy. Matt1200 I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe in the difference between high and low brow, between aristocracy and working class, between fine art and fine engineering I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m pretty much of Ian Nairn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s view, confirmed when I took my then seven-year-old to A Midsummer Night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dream. He laughed all through it and loved Pyramus and Thisbe more than anyone should really. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you get it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I asked. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The language is a bit strange isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Yeah, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funny. That lion \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. Fifteen years into reviewing Shakey and Chekhov and Lorca and pantos, I still apply his metric: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is it funny/moving/entertaining?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd If schools must teach Shakespeare (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure they should \u00e2\u20ac\u201c teach narrative, character and language through more accessible stuff, pace Nairn above), then treat it as entertainment. Get that and the poetry, psychology and drama will follow. And never give the phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u0153iambic pentameter\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd house room. MouthoftheMersey I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not certain that it is solely an intellectual pursuit. Only last week we saw a matinee performance of Julius Caesar. Sitting behind us was a party of junior schoolchildren. They seemed to enjoy the show. MrCassandra Yes, but would they have chosen to come of their own accord? Bluegum Depends if it was Class 2B, or not 2B \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Micktrick The language was different when he wrote. You have to learn that language \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all the little tricks, like what \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wherefore\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd actually means. It takes a good teacher. Most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have access to a good teacher or are too lazy to learn. Gloria Johnson Shakespeare didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak modern English, but a mixture of late Middle English and modern English. Which, by the way, he pronounced totally differently from that of English speakers today, because he lived during the Great Vowel Shift, when a vast number of words changed their pronunciation. A more relevant question is: why is it that the English-speaking world has yet to produce a better playwright than Shakespeare in more than four centuries? Surely someone must have been able to improve on his achievements. But, according to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153experts\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in such matters, no, they cannot. Perhaps there is some problem with the way we teach English. Allan Doodes Shakespeare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plays were for the masses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and so are good productions of Shakespeare today. Because the language has changed over 400 years, his words are perhaps not as accessible as in the 16th century. Shakespeare appears not to have been interested in the written texts of his plays; the scripts were tools for working actors. It is only the written Shakespeare that has become the intellectuals\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 playground. On the stage, Shakespeare still works! Ted Witham I suggest Lilian Winstanley (1875-1960) had it right. In her works on Shakespeare, she posited these plays as media, specifically the communication of news. She wrote this in 1921-23, when news was communicated via newspapers and radio. Three hundred years before TV and radio, plays could get around star chamber censorship by using symbolic mythology. A 16th-century author would not want to lose one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s head for performing current events. Sander Fredman Modern scholarship suggests that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shakespeare writing for the masses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has been overstated in the past, probably because we like to think of the Bard and his culture as being inclusive and democratic. It really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true that entry to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of a public theatre cost a penny, but given that an artisan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wage was perhaps 6s, this was still a significant outlay. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probable that the public theatres\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 audience went down as far as the middling sort, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not really \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the masses\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In addition, there were private theatres such as Blackfriars, entry to which cost a great deal more, and of course Shakespeare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company (Lord Chamberlain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s/King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Men) played many times at court. Macbeth even has a dumbshow featuring a mirror to show the king\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s face, who was present at the first performance. Readers have often wrongly thought that the bawdy bits of his plays were for the lower classes, which is ridiculous when you think about it; posh people like smut as much as poor people. Sorry if all this is disappointing, but Shakespeare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s society was riven with class divides and conflicts, as reflected in his plays. Dr Peter Howell Shakespeare wrote for audiences encompassing a wide range of people: intellectuals, uneducated, educated and all. He played with the ambiguities of language, and his many, many themes can generate endless meaning, stimulating much thought \u00e2\u20ac\u201c funny, scurrilous and also serious \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which appeals to our human minds simply because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting. He also generates powerful dramatic emotions, of pathos and of tragedy. Shakespeare included allusions to contemporary and classical texts, so more than one intertextual discussion is going on at once. The issues this raised are of timeless human interest, eg \u00e2\u20ac\u0153necessity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in King Lear: what do we really need to survive? What is a necessity and what can we do without? Thus issues of poverty and luxury were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153played\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with in his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plays\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while simultaneously invoking such texts as Boethius\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 On the Consolation of Philosophy, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153making a virtue of necessity\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, along with biblical allusions, eg naked we enter this world: Thou art the thing itself: unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton here. (King Lear, Act 3, Scene 4) Answering your question requires the volumes of material on Shakespeare (and more) which can be found in any university library. Shakespeare is one of the joys of life. Mary Davies Shakespeare\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vocabulary, idioms and language construction are endlessly inventive and fascinating: difficult to deconstruct, sometimes shocking, sometimes hilarious. However, it is beyond question that many speeches in the plays are incomprehensible for a modern audience. The key to answering this question, though, is whether we are meant to read Shakespeare at all. I have been an English teacher for more than 30 years and it constantly surprises me when teachers introduce a play by reading it, when the first port of call should always be a good production. This is really what Shakespeare is about: the visual spectacle, the emotional inner thoughts, the funny asides, the action! With a thoughtful director and good actors, anyone can access the stories that he tells, even if they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t decipher every single word or scene. Nowadays, we approach Shakespeare as something to analyse; in his own time, he was revered as a master storyteller. The truth is that Shakespeare wrote for the general public and the intellectual elite; we need to adjust our approach to him in secondary education and reclaim him for the masses. Dave Fouracre The fundamental concern of literature is in creating a greater understanding of the human condition. From this, we can evolve. The trouble is, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need for evolution if you are born to be a cog in a machine: the proles need not concern themselves with efforts of such thoughtfulness! For as long as the elite dictate cultural opportunity, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to keep the best bits for themselves.

If you have been worrying about bigger things \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Kakhovka dam, the demise of summer polar ice by 2030 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you may not know that UPFs are ultra-processed foods, engineered to be as hard to resist as the TikTok algorithm: nutritionally empty, stuffed with texture and flavour enhancers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not nourishment,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dr Chris Van Tulleken, whose book, Ultra-Processed People, explores their pervasiveness and impact, told the Guardian Science Weekly podcast. I am in thrall to Big Hoops: my obsession with reconstituted crispy potato is one of my main personality traits. But otherwise, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not especially chill about what I eat; I love food but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not simple. It is a long, dreary hangover, I suppose, from my early 20s when I would avidly read women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s health magazines while on the train to see a lovely psychiatrist who was treating me for bulimia, bringing along a neat food diary, proudly tracking how many healthy fruit and vegetables I had eaten. Compared with the #nutrition TikToks I get served \u00e2\u20ac\u201c carefully contoured girls in Lululemon leggings weighing blueberries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m an amateur neurotic. I have just had to look up what \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tracking macros\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd means (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I did in my 90s food diary, but fancier). I go whole years letting greed and joy win over rigidity. But when something in my life, or the world at large, feels dangerously out of control, that is my maladaptive way of coping. This last year of a world teetering on the edge of multiple catastrophes has sent me weird again: it started with that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eat 30 plants a week\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd recommendation from Prof Tim Spector, which had me self-soothing by totting up my intake and fretting about my microbiome. Now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m scanning packaging for emulsifiers and humectants too. If this annoys and bores you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c God, me too. The self-absorption; the misdirected energy. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my unease about UPFs, really. I can afford good food and choice in my life; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fine (or I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be run over by a bus, faculties weakened by tediously contemplating my antioxidant intake). As Van Tulleken says: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We know that rich people eat far less ultra-processed food than poor people; if you simply give people money, they stop eating it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd People rely on UPFs for convenience, cost and little or large hits of comfort, and avoiding them takes time and cash. In a study on the impact of UPF consumption on calorie intake and weight, researchers in Maryland spent 40% more money buying the food for trial participants\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 unprocessed diet. It is the same set of problems with eating the optimal 30 plants a week \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how expensive is that, especially in our stupid post-Brexit food economy? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beyond the reach of a vast swathe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps most \u00e2\u20ac\u201c of the population. So those who can apply their resources and energy to getting healthier do so and the gulf grows. It seems grindingly unfair. We have known health outcomes are income-correlated since at least the 19th century, but the insidious ubiquity of UPFs rigs an already unfair game to a scandalous degree. We have an ever more sophisticated understanding of how to be healthier. It is brilliant that research is furthering our knowledge of how diet affects health and, crucially, how food manufacturing makes us unhealthier. But so far, it feels as if that mainly benefits a lucky few: there are better and more important uses for this data than giving the affluent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worried well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd extra stuff to optimise. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how that happens. There is industry-wide irresponsibility, and without regulation it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change; there is so much else that needs to change too, it feels overwhelming. I want to soak some linseeds just thinking about it. But we have to think radically about food, how we access it and how it is produced. Change isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impossible: in Li\u00c3\u00a8ge in Belgium, which is by no means a rich city, they are working towards 100% organic, locally produced school food by 2024; 5,000 children in the poorest areas get free soup or fruit at breaktime. There are initiatives like that across the world. They are infinitesimally small, and maybe they are not even part of the bigger answer in the long term. But they sure as hell are a better answer than me tracking my macros.

Bitar, who lives in Olympia, Washington, told CNN the book may have been left by someone while visiting his family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now-closed store in Hoquiam, Washington.

I thought that spell this morning from Scott Boland was outstanding. To take the edge and for the catch to sit safely in the hands was a nice one. And to get Jadeja in the same over set us up nicely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Will India accept that the better side won?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd asks John Holthouse. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153A few inflated egos in the Indian dressing room, and an awful lot of pathetic whining from their supporters yesterday. Will be looking for signs of graciousness in defeat.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think anyone could argue that the better team won. Now Scott Boland on his first game in England: It was good fun. Nice to come over here. Our bowling group was brilliant to take 20 wickets. Just had to hit similar areas all the time. It was nice [to get Kohli]. Smith took another great catch and Green took some blinders. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been playing state cricket for Victoria for 12 years, done some hard work and now nice to play international cricket. Imperious is right. Up next, Mitchell Starc: We had to be patient to get the breakthroughs. We needed that little rub of the green [he says, mentioning the stunning grab from Smith to get Kohli]. The way [Rahane] played in the first innings, we knew we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the foot off the gas. If we stuck to our areas we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d get chances and we took them quickly. Thjis group has been fantastic for a long time. We set ourselves some goals that didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go our way, but the way this group has played for the past two years, this is a testament to them. Coming off that Test series [against India] the guys know each other quite well. Two fantastic sides, fantastic cricket to watch, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to enjoy this as a group. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the deserving player of the match, Travis Head: It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s amazing. A lot of hard work over two years so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been nice. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had this approach for two years. I want to be proactive and be good enough to stay out there for a period of time. It was nice to be out there with Smudge. It was an amazing week. Hopefully this will be a couple of big months for [Steve Smith]. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always had the confidence. Just about going out there and expressing it. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always been open to change and open to learning. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve bedded down somewhat of a blueprint. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about being consistent on and off the field. We doubled down on them and were able to reap the rewards. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wonder how many times this summer we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to read that : \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcAustralia have been immense this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already got it saved, Jeremy Boyce. From start to finish, Australia have led this Test and are rightly crowned the best red ball team in the world. A glut of runs in the first dig, ruthless with the ball when they got their hands on it, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll take some beating. Good luck Ben and Baz. After two years Australia are World Test Championship winners. A reverse sweep from Shami loops towards the man at point and he goes for 13 as India are bowled out for 235. This is Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ninth ICC trophy. Lyon collects his fourth for this innings. 63rd over: India 234-9 (Shami 13, Siraj 1) After getting smacked for two fours \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one a sweetly timed lofted on-drive, the other a fine swivelled pull \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Starc thought he had Shami caught behind. It was given out but the review showed it clipped the thigh pad. Shami is given out, caught behind down the leg side, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s off the thigh pad. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wait continues. 62nd over: India 224-9 (Shami 4, Siraj 0) Lyon has another. Australia just one wicket from victory. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been immense this morning. Bharat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slog across the line catches a top edge and Lyon pouches a simple up and under. It was the second last ball and the field was up. Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame Bharat for taking a swipe at it. Bharat survives! He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done really well to get back in. Beaten in the flight by Lyon as he went searching for a drive. Carey was sharp but not sharp enough. Outstanding bowling though from Lyon. Hold tight. I reckon Carey has just stumped Bharat. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going upstairs. 61st over: India 224-8 (Bharat 23, Shami 4) More success for Starc. I know I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve left him out of my team for the first Ashes Test but he remains an expert in mopping up the tail. Shami fights back with an uppercut to a rising ball outside the off stump but this is just gravy now. Australia two away from securing another ICC trophy. Nasty bouncer from Starc. Yadav is expecting the full and straight one so is in no position to handle this well placed bumper. He gets a glove on it and it ricochets off his helmet. Carey has to stretch to pluck it with one hand. The Aussie keeper is having a great game and he made that look easier than it was. 60th over: India 220-7 (Bharat 23, Yadav 1) Bharat unfurls an aggressive slog sweep against Lyon but only gets a single in the deep. He thought about keeping the strike as it was off the first ball of the over. Yadav squirts one off the inside edge that has short leg interested but does get off strike with a thick edge into the gully region. Bharat can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find a single so Yadav must face up to Starc. 59th over: India 218-7 (Bharat 22, Yadav 0) Starc sees the funny side as Green\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wild chuck at the stumps misses by some distance and skips away for four overthrows, gifting Bharat five runs. Yadav safely navigates the rest of the over despite showing Starc all three stumps. Any Indian fans out there with an interest in tennis? Robert F Speed has a silver lining for you: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is good as the\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Roland Garros final is on a bit later and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather not to have to watch the two screens.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd 58th over: India 213-7 (Bharat 17, Yadav 0) Delicious from Lyon. Drift and turn, he beats Thakur on the inside edge to trap him lbw then whizzes one past Yadav\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outside edge with a flighted teaser. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get that many Test wickets without knowing what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing. Thakur reviews but this looks plumb. Lyon from round the wicket, pitches that on off stump and spins it back into the right hander. Hits him on the knee roll but there isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a huge stride. Three reds and India are seven down. 57th over: India 212-6 (Bharat 16, Thakir 0) Starc joins the party as the bells of doom sound in the distance for India. Another poor shot from a batter who should know better. Starc does deserve credit though for hammering a good length from round the wicket, tricking Rahane into believing he could simply chuck his hands at the lifting ball. Rahane can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help himself as he throws his hands at a wider one and nicks off. Starc roars with delight as Australia inch nearer. A poor shot really. That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t full enough for the stroke given the lack of foot movement towards the bounce of the ball. Perhaps a little nibble away off the seam. Certainly extra bounce and the outside edge and safely snaffled by Carey behind the stumps. 56th over: India 212-5 (Rahane 46, Bharat 16) Lyon into the attack. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s round the wicket to the right handers in search of the rough outside leg stump. One drag down is deposited towards the cover boundary as Rahane leans back and punches with precision. A single for each batter means it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s six off that set. Ha! I promise I hit send before Lyon was tossed the ball. Here comes Gary the Goat. 55th over: India 206-5 (Rahane 41, Bharat 15) Another lovely stroke from Rahane though that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy pickings from a Starc half volley which is sent back down the ground. Solid for the rest of the set as a fourth stump line is defended with a broad bat held by soft hands. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to see some spin introduced. 54th over: India 202-5 (Rahane 37, Bharat 15) Just a single as Rahane moves forward and clips Green towards the on side where Boland has to slide to keep it to one. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m liking this length from Green. File that under \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbowls a heavy ball\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Morning Dan/all, Gervase Greene here. If Wisden ever get around to listing the top-100 players who convince colleagues into stupid reviews, surely Marnus Labuschagne would need to buy up every copy of the Yellow Bible - and shred them too? Great batsman, excellent team-man, atrocious judgement otherwise. Infectious enthusiasm is not a reliable barometer for anything.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just Langer was saying just that on the Sky comms. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d put Quinton de Kock on that list. Would love to read that, just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask me to put that list together. 53rd over: India 201-5 (Rahane 36, Bharat 15) Starc is round the wicket looking to work the angle into the right handers. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wayward first up, splaying one wide down the leg. He adjusts but not enough so Bharat can whip him for a single down to a wide fine leg. He adjusts to Rahane but the Indian batter simply presses forward and unfurls a gorgeous straight check-drive down the ground for four. Lovely balance. Rahane clips a single off his pads as Starc coughs up six from that over. Drinks. Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hour for sure. India 31-2 from 11 overs. Australia now five wickets away from hoisting the Mace. 52nd over: India 195-5 (Rahane 31, Bharat 14) Bharat gets a big stride to Green and leans into a drive. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a half volley but because of his footwork he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ab;e to hit through the line. He meets it with the outside half of his blade but gets enough on it to see it race towards the deep point boundary for four. Shot of the day. He keeps the strike with a pushed single past mid-on. Agree with all of this. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Neser. Need his batting if Starc goes.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from David Meiklejohn, referencing Michael Neser who has been called up to the Australian squad. Guessing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re thinking Neser should play only if Hazlewood isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit? 51st over: India 190-5 (Rahane 31, Bharat 9) Mitch Starc on for a spell that could determine his spot in the Ashes team. His natural length is fuller than the other Aussies and on this pitch, under this heat, with a ball that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s over 50 overs old, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot easier for the batters to handle. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s now bowled eight overs in this innings and registered 0-48. Can see why. Bharat takes three, first with a couple through square leg and then a single dabbed down to deep third. Now that you mention it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 (pedants, direct your ire at Jarrod, not me) 50th over: India 187-5 (Rahane 31, Bharat 6) Cam Green \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all seven metres of him \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is into the attack and he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hammering a good length after a loose bouncer to start. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spitting and making things uncomfortable for Bharat who happily gets down the other end with an awkward inside edge to a lifter into his ribs. Rahane leaves his only delivery of the over from the back foot. 49th over: India 186-5 (Rahane 31, Bharat 5) Two off that Boland over \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a single apiece for each batter. Boland has it on a string. Moving it both ways off the seam at will. Could watch him all day. The question is, who misses out if Hazlewood is fit? Starc for me. Any thoughts? Australia review again. Surely sliding down leg. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s see. Boland is confident. Just as I thought. Australia burn another one. 48th over: India 184-5 (Rahane 30, Bharat 4) A maiden for Cummins (the one leg bye off Rahane\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pad doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count against the bowler). Bharat is hit but soldiers on. Australia moving in for the kill. Cummins has sconned Bharat. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s short and the Indian \u00e2\u20ac\u02dckeeper ducks while averting his eyes. That means he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s at the mercy of the bounce but luck is not with him. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crunched on the back of his head and now the physios are out conducting a concussion test. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Scott Boland\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is simply the most devastating bowler I have ever seen in international cricket.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s from Robert Speed and honestly, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not going to argue. Reminds me of a peak Vernon Philander when the Saffa was unplayable. Not quick, not menacing, doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hoop it round corners. Just routinely hits an uncomfortable area and tests the batter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technique with every ball. Remarkable. 47th over: India 183-5 (Rahane 30, Bharat 4) Talk about one of the great overs of this WTC cycle. Set up Kohli by dangling the bait before working over Jadeja. Then, with the final ball, Boland gets one to spit off a good length and it flies off Bharat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s edge, up and over a leaping Warner to run away for four. Stunning stuff. He wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t supposed to play in this game. Now he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surely inked on the team sheet for the first Ashes Test. Scotty Boland is on fire! Round the wicket angled into the left hander, he gets one to hold its line and the new batter nibbles at the good length. Perhaps he could have left it but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the angle that convinces him to play at it. He can only manage a thin edge and Carey is smiling even before he pouches it. Two in the over for the Australian cult hero. Is that the game!? An absolute stunner from Steve Smith at second slip. The first bit of width from Boland and Kohli takes the bait, driving away from his body. It catches a thick edge and flies to the cordon where Smudge gets both hands around a rocket to his right. Clings on and the Aussies have the big fish. Not sure what Labuschagne heard. Clear daylight between Kohli\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bat on the forward press and Boland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s full ball. Ooooh. Now then. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve gone upstairs for a caught behind review. Seems that Marnus at extra cover heard something and has convinced Cummins to have a look. 46th over: India 179-3 (Kohli 49, Rahane 30) Kohli leans forward and steals a single in the covers. One more for Rahane down to deep third. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve already lost count \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is that the sixth time this morning? Kohli closes this Cummins over with a nudge wide of mid-on. Spot on! 45th over: India 176-3 (Kohli 47, Rahane 29) A better set from Boland. His first ball rises from a shortish length but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wide enough to let go. Another jags back into Kohli as he shoulders arms. But there it is again, back of a length at an innocuous pace around the fifth stump and Kohli steers a single to deep third. India are eating this whale one bite at a time. 44th over: India 175-3 (Kohli 46, Rahane 29) Too easy for the Indians. First Rahane and then Kohli open the face to Cummins and have enough time before dinking a single down to deep third. Not sure how they solve that problem. Cummins has moved his cover squarer of the wicket which opens up a gap on the off side. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good bumper to end the over and Rahane tries to duck under it but leaves his bat dangling like a periscope. The ball catches the top edge and flies down to fine leg for four. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Morning Daniel,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Good morning Tony White, thanks for dropping by. This could be quite a stressful, red winey sort of forenoon, I trust you will be holding our hands tightly throughout. And clapping later as India push it over the line!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Red wine in this heat?! Someone check on Tony in a few hours. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be passed out after my second glass. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got you mate. Sounds like you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got an excellent day planned. 43rd over: India 169-3 (Kohli 45, Rahane 24) Rahane opens the face and runs another single down to deep third. I might as well copy that sentence and have it on standby. Kohli is standing about half a foot outside of his crease to Boland. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an appeal for lbw but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sliding down leg. 42nd over: India 168-3 (Kohli 45, Rahane 23) It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cummins to Kohli but the prince of Indian cricket nudges a rising ball towards midwicket and gets down the other end with ease. A little soft as far as the Aussies are concerned. Rahane dabs a couple down to deep third and then keeps the strike with a single off the last ball. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s perfected that shot over this Test. The pitch looks as flat as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been over the past five days. Simply hitting a good length won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do for Australia. 41st over: India 164-3 (Kohli 44, Rahane 20) Scott Boland is on it straight away. Probing on a fourth stump line around a good length. Rahane is on the front foot and meeting the ball with the middle of his bat. He looks solid as he plays a mini game with the man at cover and sees out a maiden. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dan I presume Geoff is unavailable because he needs a day to recover from this morning\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s episode of Bluey, simply titled Cricket, which is the best encapsulation of cricket\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in growing up in Australia you will ever see, and is probably the television highlight of the year. It is utterly unmissable and everyone reading should seek it out at lunch if they have not already had the unalloyed pleasure.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Geoff is saving all his best words for the final report so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re stuck with me, Eamonn Maloney. But as the father of a two-year-old, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll absolutely be making a note of that. What do you make of this from Shubman Gill? Just #Bantz or a line crossed from a pro player? Ten minutes to go. Time enough to pick at the bones of yesterday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s controversial grab from Cam Green. Did the ball touch the ground? Well, yes. Does that mean it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a legitimate catch? Not exactly. Confused? Not to worry. Geoff Lemon explains all: While you wait I highly recommend this brilliant interview with Usman Khawaja, penned by Andy Bull. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re one of the seven cricket fans who didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t already love the Australian batter, read this and get on board. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a proper gem. If India pull this off it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be one of the truly great Test performances. To put their task in context, targets of 400 or more are rarely hauled in. In fact, only four teams have managed it in 252 attempts. Don Bradman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Australians notched 404-3 in the fourth Test of the 1948 Ashes thanks to Arthur Morris\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 182 and an unbeaten 173 from the Don. 28 years later, hundreds from Sanil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath saw India reach 406-4 against the West Indies. In 2003 the West Indies\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lower order got them over the line with 418-7 against an Australian attack of Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Brett Lee. And the Aussies were on the wrong side of another historic chase when a century from AB de Villiers steered South Africa to 414-4 in Perth in 2008. Folks, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a belter on our hands here. Modern Tests whiz along at such a frenetic pace that day five humdingers are rare, but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s exactly what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forming over the heat hazed horizon in south London. In case you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re just catching up, this is how it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shaped up over four undulating days: India won the toss under cloud cover and nabbed two wickets with the new ball. Then Travis Head and Steve Smith starred as the Aussies piled on 469 before Pat Cummins and co skittled the Indian top order. Ajinkya Rahane helped avoid the follow on and Australia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s middle order gave their bowlers 470 to defend. That looked like plenty when Cheteshwar Pujara was bounced out to leave India on 93-3, a whopping 377 runs adrift. But Rahane and Virat Kohli rallied and will resume their 71 run stand on a pitch that has shown some variable bounce but is still decent to bat on. An Australian win is the most likely outcome. One or two scalps in this first session should all but seal it but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t count out a blockbuster chase. My name is Daniel/Dan and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m genuinely thrilled to be here. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re as jazzed as I am drop an email or hit me up on Twitter.

Australia secured the first and biggest (physically) of the two trophies they hope to bring home with them from England by wrapping up victory against India in the World Test Championship final, winning by an emphatic 209 runs after a performance that, for all the penultimate-day catch-related micro-controversy, demonstrated unarguable superiority. India arrived for the final day in search of a miracle. To pull off what would have been a world-record run chase, or even to cling on for the draw that would have led to them sharing the trophy, they needed Virat Kohli to pull a rabbit out of the hat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and to do it extremely slowly. He lasted just half an hour. Scott Boland looks an unlikely sporting hero. He has the build of a farmyard labourer, as if he might be as good at shifting bales of hay as he turns out to be at shifting batters. After each delivery he walks back to his mark in the manner of someone who is not at all keen on actually getting there. There is not so much a spring in his step as a winter, deep and dark and foreboding. He bowled the first over of the day, a crowd still full of optimism cheering even the dot balls, and there were six of them. Pat Cummins took the second, as India slowly felt their way into their work. Ajinkya Rahane hit to point for a couple, Kohli running forwards for the first and jogging backwards for the second, eye always on the ball. If he wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wearing spikes he would probably have been moonwalking. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kohli, Kohli, Kohli,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they chanted. And then they fell quiet. The decisive over started oddly, Kohli on strike, the ball beating the bat, Alex Carey collecting, nobody really appealing but Australia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c urged on, it seemed, by Marnus Labuschagne at point \u00e2\u20ac\u201c deciding to review anyway and finding that UltraEdge also thought it was not out. Two balls later, however, Kohli was gone, Steve Smith taking an excellent catch at second slip, diving to his right to collect it two-handed. Never mind their batting and bowling: Smith at slip and Cameron Green at gully are spectacular assets. Two balls later Ravindra Jadeja followed, nicking through to Carey, and from there it was a matter of time. Rahane produced a measure of resistance and a few lovely shots, including two immaculately timed straight drives in successive Mitchell Starc overs. But in Starc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next over he too was gone, the ball kissing the edge on its way to Carey. He scored 46, three fewer than Kohli, and left India\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tail fully exposed. Nathan Lyon did the rest, taking three of the four remaining wickets including an excellent delivery to dismiss Shardul Thakur lbw, drifting across the batter before turning back in. Soon enough Australia stood one wicket from glory and they took it twice, Mohammed Shami saved on review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ball having clipped pocket rather than bat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c before, just five balls later, Mohammed Siraj reverse-swept straight to backward point where Boland waited, the most fitting of matchwinners, to take the catch. India went into the last day needing to score 280 across three sessions without losing all their wickets. In the end they did lose all their wickets, in just one session, while scoring only 70. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I thought we started well, winning the toss and putting them into bat,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rohit Sharma said.

About two months later, Crosby now has more than 21,000. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a lot of joy and gratitude over the fact that sharing my experience has been able to help other women with the same struggles that I have\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in trying to lose weight, said Crosby, a 34-year-old who lives in San Antonio and works for a property management company. Crosby\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s popularity is part of a larger trend. People have nicknamed the supplement, which can be purchased online and at convenience stores, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ozempic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, referring to the prescription weight loss drug that has also received significant attention because of its effectiveness at helping people shed pounds. Since Ozempic is expensive and can be difficult to obtain, it appears some consumers have instead turned to berberine. On TikTok, videos about the supplement have generated more than 92 million views. But physicians and dietitians caution that there is little evidence that berberine can actually help people lose weight and that the long-term effects of using it are unclear. In short, they say, berberine may just be the latest weight loss fad. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153People see a little bullet, something that\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd they think \u00e2\u20ac\u0153might help, and it catches on, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s huge for a short period of time, and then it kind of goes away\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Deborah Cohen, a registered dietician and associate professor in the Rutgers University Department of Clinical and Preventive Nutrition Sciences. Berberine comes from the root and bark of several plants and has been used in China as a medicinal herb since ancient times, according to a study in the Frontiers in Physiology journal. Weight loss is, of course, always a big topic of discussion in the United States because 41.9% of the population is obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Crosby found an article about berberine while conducting research to determine whether insulin resistance might have been why she was eating healthy but not losing weight. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That signaled to me that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something going on with my body,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Crosby said of the lack of results. A report in the journal Clinical Nutrition Espen states that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153obesity-induced inflammation can exacerbate insulin resistance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153berberine has anti-inflammatory effects\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Crosby said she would have asked her doctor for Ozempic but she had dropped her health insurance because of its cost. Even if she had coverage, many insurers won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay for the drug, which can cost more than $900 a month, according to GoodRx. Instead, Crosby paid $24 for a three-month supply of berberine. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not comparable, in any way, shape or form\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to Ozempic, said Dr Pieter Cohen, a Harvard Medical School associate professor who studies supplements. There is significant evidence that Ozempic not only leads to weight loss but that it reduces the risk of health issues like diabetes, heart disease or strokes, Cohen said. A New England Journal Medicine study featured almost 2,000 people with obesity and found that those who took Ozempic and made lifestyle changes lost 15% of their body weight in 68 weeks. Studies of berberine have generally only lasted one to three months, feature less than 70 participants, and typically do not measure its effects on body weight, according to a review published in the journal Clinical Nutrition Espen. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Obesity is a chronic disease, and three months is a very short amount of time. In order to know if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really any lasting effects, the studies need to be much, much longer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Deborah Cohen. Even if studies did have a bigger sample size and longer duration, people would not necessarily be able to purchase the same berberine used in the research because it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a supplement rather than a pharmaceutical drug, said Cohen. While the Food and Drug Administration closely monitors prescription drugs, the agency provides little scrutiny over dietary supplements, so \u00e2\u20ac\u0153companies put whatever amount\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of berberine \u00e2\u20ac\u0153they want into the products, and no one is checking to make sure that the amount is accurately listed on the label\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Pieter Cohen said. People on TikTok are also discussing the comparisons between berberine and metformin, a drug used to treat high blood sugar in people with diabetes. Like metformin, berberine reduced insulin resistance when it was tested in obese rats; though further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of berberine on people with type 2 diabetes, according to a study in the journal Metabolism. Renee Carthan, a high school Spanish teacher in Lake Charles, Louisiana, turned to berberine in October 2022 after gaining \u00e2\u20ac\u0153about 65lbs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in one year. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to take Ozempic because she had tried a different prescription weight loss medication that ultimately wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t effective and she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like how it made her feel. She also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to worsen an earlier shortage of Ozempic, which is also a diabetes medication, and potentially make it more difficult for people like her father, who has type 2 diabetes, to obtain the medicine. (There is no longer a shortage of the drug, Reuters reported in March.) Her doctor told her about vitamins and supplements that could help her lose weight. In October, she started taking vitamin D, magnesium and berberine supplements and continued to exercise. She weighed 212lbs; now she weighs 184, she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I feel great,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a full-circle thing. I have more energy, which makes me want to work out more. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s helped my confidence.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Despite such stories of weight loss, physicians and dieticians remain concerned because they say they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know the long-term effects of using berberine. Scientists still don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if the weight loss will last or if the weight loss from berberine is safe, Cohen said. Crosby, the TikTok influencer, has lost 8lbs in eight weeks, she said. Her clothes fit her differently and she has less of an appetite. She has received comments from people on social media who also have seen the scale finally moving. Others have said they experienced headaches, bloating and vomiting on the supplement. For anyone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interested in berberine, Crosby advises people to talk with their doctor. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just start taking things because they become very popular,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wish [berberine] could help everybody, but obviously we have to be careful and remind ourselves that it might not.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/11/christine-and-the-queens-paranoia-angels-true-love-review-heavy-emotions-and-heavenly-longing-madonna", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "Christine and the Queens Parano\u00c3\u00afa, Angels, True Love \u00e2\u20ac\u201c heavy emotions and heavenly longing", "lead": "Processing his mother\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death, the French artist holds nothing back on a heady fourth album that rewards repeated listens", "author": "Michael Cragg", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T12:00:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764567", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/f0d7b966df1d497b12e6dc763c522dad62aa3709/0_46_1488_893/500.jpg", "body": "Released last November, Redcar les adorables \u00c3\u00a9toiles, the confounding third album by Redcar, AKA Chris, AKA Christine and the Queens, was overshadowed by talk of a less oblique follow-up waiting in the wings.

Prior to Signal, Whittaker worked at Google, co-founded NYU\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AI Now Institute and was an adviser to the Federal Trade Commission. After 10 years at Google you organised the walkout over the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attitude to sexual harassment accusations, after which in 2019 you were forced out. How did you feel about that? Let me go back into some of the details, because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a kind of broad story, and it matters for this moment. I was running a research group looking at the social implications of AI. I was pretty well known in the company and outside as somebody who discussed these issues in ways that were counter to Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s public messaging. I was an internal dissenter, an academic. Toward late 2017 I had a colleague flag me that there was a secret contract [known as Maven] between Google and the Department of Defense [DOD] to build AI systems for drone targeting. That for me was when my organising started, because I realised I had been presenting very clear arguments that people agreed with \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really matter. This was not an issue of force of argument. This was an issue of the ultimate goals of this company are profit and growth and DOD contracts were always going to sort of trump these intellectual and moral considerations. So that was when you began organising a walkout? What do you do if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the power to change it, even if you win the debate? That was where the organising started for me. I wrote the Maven letter [which gathered 3,000 employee signatures] and we got the Maven contract cancelled. The walkout was a big spectacle. There was a news story about Andy Rubin getting a $90m (\u00c2\u00a372m) payout after an accusation of sexual misconduct [which he denies]. What came to a head was deep concerns about the moral and ethical direction of Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s business practices and an understanding that those moral and ethical lapses were also reflected in the workplace culture. How did I feel about that? I am very happy. I did not stand by and let my integrity get eaten away by making excuses for being complicit. Would you say Google is pretty typical of big tech companies, that they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re only really bothered about moral and ethical concerns if they affect their bottom line? Ultimately every quarter the executives at Google meet the board and they need to be reporting up into the right projections on growth and revenue. Those are the key objectives of shareholder capitalism. If Sundar [Pichai, Google CEO] went to the board and said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Morally we need to leave $10bn on the table. Let Microsoft have this contract,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be fired in an instant. It is not a form or a set of goals that is going to be amenable with putting the social good first. Isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there a business case for stamping out sexual harassment, and having a diverse workforce, and fixing biases in algorithms and so on? There is no Cartesian window of neutrality that you can put an algorithm behind and be like, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is outside our present and history.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd These algorithms are trained on data that reflects not the world, but the internet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is worse, arguably. That is going to encode the historical and present-day histories of marginalisation, inequality etc. There isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a way to get out of that and then be like, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is a pristine, unbiased algorithm,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because data is authored by people. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always going to be a recycling of the past and then spitting that out, projecting that on to the present. We can say there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a business case, but let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s be real about it. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to see a workforce transformed in the name of equality there are many powerful people who will have to lose their position, or their status, or their salary. We live in a world where people are misogynist and racist. Where there is behaviour from some that assumes women or non-white men shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be in the room. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re making billions of dollars now. We can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave this up to a business case, I think, is the argument I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m making. So in 2020-21 when Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell from Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s AI ethics unit were ousted after warning about the inequalities perpetuated by AI, did you feel, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Oh, here we go again\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? Timnit and her team were doing work that was showing the environmental and social harm potential of these large language models \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which are the fuel of the AI hype at this moment. What you saw there was a very clear case of how much Google would tolerate in terms of people critiquing these systems. It didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter that the issues that she and her co-authors pointed out were extraordinarily valid and real. It was that Google was like: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hey, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to metabolise this right now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Is it interesting to you how their warnings were received compared with the fears of existential risk expressed by ex-Google \u00e2\u20ac\u0153godfather of AI\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Geoffrey Hinton recently? If you were to heed Timnit\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings you would have to significantly change the business and the structure of these companies. If you heed Geoff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings, you sit around a table at Davos and feel scared. Geoff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s warnings are much more convenient, because they project everything into the far future so they leave the status quo untouched. And if the status quo is untouched you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to see these companies and their systems further entrench their dominance such that it becomes impossible to regulate. This is not an inconvenient narrative at all. After Google you were appointed senior adviser on AI at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Did you find the process of trying to regulate disillusioning? I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come in with rose-coloured glasses. I had been speaking with folks in Congress, folks in the FTC and various federal agencies for years and at one point I testified in front of Congress. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t new, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t coming to DC with a suitcase and a dream, but it did give me a sense of how fierce the opposition was. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll say the minute it was announced that I was getting the FTC role, far-right news articles dropped. The bat-signal went out. Of course, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not the only one. Lina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office [Khan, FTC chair] was inundated with this. But within an agency where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a vision, where there is an analysis that is not grounded in sci-fi but in an understanding of these systems and this industry, there was a huge amount of opposition. That was coming from tech lobbyists, that was coming from the Chamber of Commerce, that was coming from some folks within the FTC who would like to go get a nice little general counsel job at a firm and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want their name on something that might be seen as anti-business. There was great vision there, but the machinery is difficult to operate under those conditions. Unlike many other tech entrepreneurs and academics you didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sign either of the two recent petitions, the Future of Life institute \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pause AI\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd letter or last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Center for AI Safety \u00e2\u20ac\u0153existential threat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd letter. No. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re good faith. These are the people who could actually pause it if they wanted to. They could unplug the data centres. They could whistleblow. These are some of the most powerful people when it comes to having the levers to actually change this, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit like the president issuing a statement saying somebody needs to issue an executive order. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s disingenuous. What appealed to you about taking the position at Signal? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been on their board for a number of years. Signal plays an important harm-reduction role in providing a mechanism for truly private communications in a world where in the past 30 years large corporations have made the decisions for us that all of our communications, our activity etc should be surveilled. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve threatened to pull Signal from the UK if the online safety bill currently making its way through parliament is passed. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll repeat what I said, which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite the headline. We will never undermine our privacy promises. We will never adulterate our encryption, we will never participate in any regime that would enforce breaking those promises. The bill proposes that users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 messages are scanned \u00e2\u20ac\u0153client side\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ie on the phone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the messages would be encrypted when sent\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The claims being made around client-side scanning, that it can protect privacy while also conducting mass surveillance, is magical thinking. It is cynically weaponising a meaningless semantic distinction between mass surveillance that happens before encryption takes effect and breaking encryption. You have politicians out there saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break encryption, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t worry.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd That is extraordinarily dishonest. And moderation in other spheres doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work particularly well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c software AI scanning messages and then difficult cases being referred to humans\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This system could never work without massive amounts of human intervention. What you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at is an unthinkably expensive system that would need constant human labour, constant updating. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking at hundreds of thousands of people being locked out of their accounts with no recourse, grinding people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s daily lives, employment, and the economy. This is a fantasy made up by people who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand how these systems actually work, how expensive they are, and how fallible they are. What is helping drive this, helping this seem plausible, is the AI hype. That is painting these systems as superhuman, as super capable, which leads to a sense in the public, and even among some politicians, that tech can do anything."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/11/ayo-akingbade-show-me-the-world-mister-john-hansard-gallery-southampton-billie-zangewa-a-quiet-fire-brighton-centre-for-contemporary-art-cca-closure-university-of-brighton", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "title": "Ayo Akingbade: Show Me the World Mister; Billie Zangewa: A Quiet Fire \u00e2\u20ac\u201c review", "lead": "Akingbade captures a day in the strange life of Lagos\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Guinness brewery; the medium is the message in<strong> </strong>Zangewa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ingenious hand-stitched silk collages.

The Fist (2022) follows a working day in a 1960s-built factory 60s factory 20 miles from Lagos. The first Guinness brewery built outside the British Isles, it was designed as a modernist icon. But Akingbade, tellingly, does not linger on the exterior, her camera focusing instead on the strange life inside. Workers sign in, incredibly slowly because the form is too long (one anxiously checks his watch, queueing behind another). Conveyor belts begin to thrum. Morning prayers are held in front of gargantuan machines: the last time you will actually hear human voices. Battalions of brown bottles rattle away to the far horizon. Crates circle round and round in industrial carousels. Walls of cans rise like monumental cliffs. The camera widens to show the workers tiny against the equipment, or passing along walkways like ghosts. Do Not Drink, warns a sign. No food or drink is ever visible. Lunchtime involves plastic bags. The separation between people and regimented capitalist order grows ever more apparent. The Super 16mm film occasionally flashes and flares, as if rising up against what it shows. This is a very subtle tension between contemporary documentary and quasi-abstract modernist film. You watch The Fist \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the title a reference to solidarity, or oppression? \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on one side of an industrial partition. On the other is a much shorter film, Faluyi (2022), that nevertheless reverses the proposition by showing a life in one day. It follows a schoolgirl, Ife, coming of age with the terrible news of her father\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sudden death in the beautiful hills of Idanre in southwestern Nigeria. Myth and mysticism, messages woven into tablecloths and songs sung by kindergarten children, a visit to a fortune teller, ceremonial singing and ecstatic dancing on the top of hill: everything fleets by without explanation, but with a fascinating picaresque grace. And a silver dress, rapidly seen on a sewing machine at the start, reappears at the end, worn by Ife as she disappears into the dusk on the back of a motorbike. The future is good, at least on this side of the partition, and in this irreducibly mysterious film. Fabric is not just Billie Zangewa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s medium, but in some senses her message. Born in 1973 to a mother who worked with textiles, and now based in Johannesburg, Zangewa has been stitching tiny fragments of off-cut silk into collaged scenes for many years. Some are botanical: the lush green landscapes of her childhood in Botswana; others are domestic or familial (her young son asleep, tenderly portrayed by his watchful mother). All are political in the sense that they elevate the place of Black women in the world. Just as one pores over a painting, the manner in which it is made as well as what is depicted, so Zangewa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s art entices mind and eye. Her stitches are barely perceptible, her scissored fragments perpetually surprising: water and air shining in the radiance of distinctive silks, faces rendered complex in their every expressive nuance. It is almost impossible to see how she manages to represent a checked shirt as seen through a beer glass. In one sardonic piece, a rich woman is at a fitting for a Dior dress. The tailor is male. Her costume is uniform, constricting, the exact opposite of what you are looking at \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is a vision of fluttering silk ingeniously imagined, and very freely worked. Zangewa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s art has moved about 60 miles along the south coast from its showing at Brighton\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) last month. It followed exhibitions at CCA by the design collective Resolve and the great American painter Bill Lynch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of the momentous events of 2022 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c more or less single-handedly rediscovered in this country by CCA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director, Ben Roberts. Now CCA has been summarily axed by the University of Brighton. They can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close the space, because it was only ever a frugal adaptation of an existing property. The staff costs were meagre, three people mounting museum-class shows since 2019. Yet the university has just spent \u00c2\u00a317m acquiring a gym on its campus for redevelopment, and speaks of focusing instead on its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153core business\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, as if education was a matter of commerce. The decision is disgraceful, and outrageous from a university that still maintains a school of art (and still boasts about the gallery on its website). Do students no longer matter, or citizens, art, or indeed artists (Helen Cammock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s forthcoming show has been cancelled)? What we see of art by chance or design, at leisure or in passing, goes to our knowledge and experience of human existence. Why should not future generations have these experiences too? Reason not the need.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a US coming-of-age tale, and may or may not be based on Maxine Clair\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own life, set as it is in the mid-50s in her native Kansas, when she herself was coming of age. It tells the story of Irene Wilson, a young girl growing up in Rattlebone, the Black part of town. Like Harper Lee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Scout, Irene is a watchful child, and when new teacher October Brown arrives in town, quickly making an impact both inside the classroom and out, Irene detects that a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no-name invisible something\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd has come to rupture her parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 marriage. Her feckless father always did have a wandering eye, and October enjoys turning heads. From here, the book fans out to tell the stories of other townsfolk, each trying diligently to make their way in a racially divided America. But this is a novel that focuses on the small things, and so while elections and race riots are taking place elsewhere, those in Rattlebone are more intimately concerned with homework, friends, the opening of a new dry-cleaning store. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only when October comes back into Irene\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life several years later, as the latter is applying for college, that Irene begins to glimpse a horizon that lies beyond home. Clair is an exquisitely empathic writer, and imbues every page with poetry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He touched me as if, slowly and gently, he were shaping my body into a woman. I found the steps awkward, but he was a born dancer.

The factchecking organisation Full Fact has obtained new freedom of information data that shows that between 1 January and 7 November 2022 only about 1% of all males arriving on small boats at Western Jet Foil claimed to be under 18 but were later found to be over 18. Full Fact has written to Robert Jenrick asking him to correct the parliamentary record or to provide data which supports his claim. Last November, Jenrick said in parliament: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153At times, up to 20% of the adult males who arrive at Western Jet Foil claim to be under 18, when clearly the number is substantially less than that.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd An initial request Full Fact made to Jenrick last November to provide evidence to support the 20% claim or to correct the parliamentary record in accordance with the ministerial code went unanswered. The organisation then submitted a freedom of information request and received the data after several months of delay by the Home Office. It is not the first time Full Fact has raised concerns about the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s use of immigration statistics. On 7 March 2023, the home secretary, Suella Braverman, accused Labour of leaving a far bigger asylum backlog than the government is currently dealing with. However, when Labour left power in 2010 the backlog was 18,954 and at the end of December 2022 it stood at 161,000. Full Fact raised concerns with the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) about ministers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 use of unpublished data and on 21 November the OSR\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s director general, Ed Humpherson, wrote to Matthew Rycroft, the permanent secretary for the Home Office, to highlight the importance of transparency of statistics. In the letter Humpherson wrote: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Given the continued public interest in and use of immigration statistics, I urge the Home Office to review ways of working to ensure that the transparent release and use of Home Office data and statistics is the default in future.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The interim chief executive at Full Fact, Andrew Dudfield, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Successive ministers have made claims about asylum and immigration which are not backed up by published data. It is the job of the prime minister, the home secretary, and the minister for immigration to communicate accurately and responsibly with the public on important issues. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Repeated failure to be transparent makes proper democratic scrutiny impossible. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vital we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all given access to the information behind the claims made by ministers when they make them, and that any data quoted publicly is freely available.

Kawczynski said the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mongolian friend\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a personal contact, and was separate to my role as an envoy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

He told the commission he did \u00e2\u20ac\u0153not understand why British passport holders should be treated differently from foreign passport holders when it comes to political parties\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and requested a meeting at the House of Commons with the watchdog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chief executive, Shaun McNally, to discuss his \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concerns\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the longstanding political finance rules banning donations from overseas donors. Kawczynski claimed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153many jurisdictions around the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd permitted political donations from foreign passport holders. Research by the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, a UN observer, suggests 70% of countries ban foreign donations to political parties. The letter was sent from Kawczynski\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parliamentary email address. The members\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 handbook on the use of the taxpayer-funded accounts say they should not be used \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for activities that could be considered party political campaigning or fundraising\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

The email was copied to the chair of the 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, the chief whip, Simon Hart, and to another member of the whips\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 office, Jo Churchill. Kawczynski said he included them in his email to the watchdog as part of his attempts to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153understand, ask and challenge, collectively, with colleagues\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the rules on electoral finance. This thirst for knowledge came as he had a potential \u00c2\u00a310,000 donation offered to his local association.

The imbalance of power, death of idealism and creeping paranoia that characterise their relationship is a study of geopolitics in miniature. What begins as fate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the pair get on the same bus and build a mythology around this chance encounter and other apparent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153signs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c becomes an agreement of sorts. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make each other miserable,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hans, a serial adulterer, says on their first night together. But ultimately, they will. Stylishly translated by Michael Hofmann, this is a finely calibrated book, the fourth by the German novelist Jenny Erpenbeck, who was born in East Berlin in 1967. Her clever treatment of the relationship as an allegory never hinders the depiction of Hans and Katharina\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day-to-day reality, or their slide from bliss to misery. The subterfuge involved in their early meetings adds to the allure for both participants, who are absorbing, flawed and, in Hans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case at least, nauseating. Katharina is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcillegal\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, we are told, who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t talk about Hans or appear with him in public. At one point she is not allowed to answer the phone in his apartment and experiences a sort of erasure, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pretending not to exist\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Erpenbeck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subtle use of mirroring reflects the unbreakable links that remained between East and West Germany, even when divided by the Wall, and the idea of Hans and Katharina as doubles, almost twins (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153they lie so close that when one turns, the other turns too\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The increasingly controlling Hans, Katharina thinks, only wants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a more attractive mirror for himself in her young flesh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Later, after she sleeps with a colleague her own age, Hans subjects her to endless recriminations, claiming that her betrayal \u00e2\u20ac\u0153made two of me. One who believes, and one who doubts.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Observation, too, is a recurring theme, whether with regard to pleasure or control. In a late plot twist it is revealed that even the watchers are being watched in the last days of the GDR, while Katharina notes that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in museums\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only those things are put on show that can find no safe place in reality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Hans, meanwhile, a product of his times, colours the thinking of his much younger lover, and their shared existence turns illusory. As the dreams of a socialist utopia crumble (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Coca-Cola\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 succeeded where Marxist philosophy has failed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), the pair find themselves in a new world, Katharina feeling like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a bad copy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of West Berliners, while Hans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s livelihood disappears. She is young enough to rebuild her life, but one of her pronouncements (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Only after a comprehensive destruction is it possible to think about a resurrection\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd), spoken at the start of the novel, proves true. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Kairos by Jenny Erpenbeck (translated by Michael Hofmann) is published by Granta (\u00c2\u00a316.99).

So on Thursday, after the court, which has a conservative supermajority, ruled that Alabama discriminated against Black voters by redrawing its congressional districts, those advocates saw a brief glint of hope. For some of the legal experts I spoke to, this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s surprise ruling, which reinforced the Voting Rights Act\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power to protect voters from racial discrimination, represented a promising omen for the preservation of race consciousness in other arenas. Of particular note is the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upcoming decision on whether to end race-related affirmative action in colleges and universities. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, for many, served as an affirmation from the court that protections such as these can and should exist in American law. The Alabama case focused on the state legislature\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153colorblind\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd approach to redistricting, which resulted in just one majority-Black district in a state where 27% of the population is Black. Now, as a result of this ruling, the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newly redrawn map could make two of the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s seven congressional districts majority-Black, which could help Democrats. In the majority opinion, the conservative chief justice, John Roberts, acknowledged concerns that the Voting Rights Act \u00e2\u20ac\u0153may impermissibly elevate race in the allocation of political power\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Yet that was not enough for Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who broke with the conservative majority, to justify overturning decades of previous court rulings. Roberts wrote, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153... the Court simply holds that a faithful application of precedent and a fair reading of the record do not bear those concerns out here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Some legal experts argue that Roberts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 reliance on precedent and trial record in this case could bode well for the court\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling on race-consciousness in college admissions, which is expected sometime this month. Similar to the protections enacted under the Voting Rights Act, colleges and universities have taken race into account during their intake processes. The practice has helped generations of Black and brown students gain access to institutions of higher education. Of policies like these, Damon Hewitt, the executive director of the Lawyers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, told me over email: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153[The Alabama decision] validated what we in the civil-rights community have been saying all along: race matters.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Affirmative action in higher education met its first challenge in 1978, in a case involving Allan Bakke, a white man who was denied admission to the University of California at Davis medical school. Bakke argued that he was twice denied entry to the medical program, which reserved 16 slots each year for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153qualified\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd applicants of color, because he was white. In an 8-1 decision, the court concluded that race could be factored in the admissions process but stopped colleges from setting racial quotas. That laid the groundwork for future efforts by white applicants to object to race-conscious admissions. But in a precedent-setting case in 2003, Grutter v Bollinger, the court ruled that higher education institutions can factor in race as a means of achieving diversity at colleges and universities because it represented a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153compelling governmental interest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now the Grutter case is under attack thanks in part to a yearslong campaign by the conservative activist Edward Blum and by legal groups focused on curtailing race-specific civil rights protections in American society. Blum has been successful in his efforts before: in 2013, for instance, he sponsored a case that overturned a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. Roberts wrote the majority opinion, effectively killing the federal government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to stop states and other jurisdictions with a sordid history of racial discrimination from imposing changes to voting laws without their permission. But the Alabama case indicates that, when it comes to race-consciousness, the perceived fixed conservative supermajority may be flexible. Deborah Archer, the co-faculty director of New York University\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Center on Race, Inequality and the Law, told me that she had noticed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shift, where it felt like the government was going to lose all of its ability to be responsive to deep racial inequalities that have persisted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s majority opinion, though, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was really kind of a push back to the sense that we have to have a colorblind, race-neutral approach in everything that the government does\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Archer, who is also the president of the American Civil Liberties Union, added the court upheld the validity of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153effects test\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is used to determine how much of a discriminatory impact a policy has on communities of color \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a practice, she said, that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you always feel is on the chopping block\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Still, it was difficult for legal experts to unpack what changed in the last decade for Roberts between the two cases in Alabama \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the 2013 Shelby county ruling and today \u00e2\u20ac\u201c let alone for his fellow conservative Kavanaugh. In 2021, Roberts and Kavanaugh joined the conservative majority in upholding voting restrictions in Arizona in Brnovich v Democratic National Committee. And in 2022, during the midterms, Roberts and Kavanaugh sided with conservative justices in allowing an election map in Louisiana that lower courts also found to be illegally gerrymandered. Archer pointed to a possible influencing factor: Kavanaugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history of hiring Black law clerks. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having a diverse group of clerks influences discussions in the way that it does in the classroom and the workplace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just having a more diverse group of people who bring different lived experiences to these questions will be helpful,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Archer said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He would hopefully then be able to argue that it is possible to be conscious of diversity and value diversity without engaging in unfair practices, to value diversity without discriminating against any other applicant.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She was cautious, however. Kavanaugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s legal record before this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ruling indicates that he is more likely to embrace race-neutrality. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It would be a mistake to assume that [Kavanaugh] will be a vote who will regularly support affirmative action or diversity programs,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Shaw said. Still, she added, based on Thursday\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision, his vote may be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gettable\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Roberts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Kavanaugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voting histories show that any prediction about the impending affirmative action decision is difficult to make. And even though Roberts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s majority opinion was incisive, and Kavanaugh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support was stunning, experts believe they should be considered cautiously. Having largely rejected race-conscious policies until this week, these two justices hold ideas about the practice that remain uncertain."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jun/11/dialogues-des-carmelites-glyndebourne-barrie-kosky-ticciati-review-poulenc", "primaryCategory": "music", "title": "Dialogues des Carm\u00c3\u00a9lites review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c jeggings not wimples but Poulenc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opera grips and haunts still", "lead": "Barrie Kosky\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerful new contemporary-set production is brought to life by a remarkable cast, led by Sally Matthews, and, in the pit, the LPO and Robin Ticciati bring heartbreaking delicacy and energy", "author": "Flora Willson", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T11:56:35Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764583", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/87fc0f59fac440daee2372bfa2ad1b1066d7fb0d/266_437_4475_2687/500.jpg", "body": "Heavy, pained breathing. Voices of unseen figures, whispering. The brisk clicks of a potato peeler. It has taken almost 50 years for Poulenc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doomed Carmelite nuns to reach Glyndebourne and their first appearance there, in a new production by Australian director Barrie Kosky, is full of noises. Some are beguiling, some mundane. Many overspill the limits of Poulenc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s score, creating unexpected moments of stasis between the opera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rapidly cross-cut scenes. These can be uncomfortable. In the most terrifyingly effective, the snips of scissors hacking at the nuns\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 hair pre-empt the guillotine strokes of the ending. In the strangest, a garden slides on to the stage, rustling in from the peeling concrete walls of Katrin Lea Tag\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s single, underpass-chic set. There are, perhaps, too many sluggish fade-outs for an opera with such inexorable momentum: Poulenc\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s score sounds the steady tramp of a French Revolution that cannot be stopped, retaining the swift transitions of the screenplay that inspired it. Those who associate Kosky with exuberant choreography or gorilla suits in Carmen may be surprised by the production\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s visual spareness. The opening references to late 18th-century costume disappear once Blanche enters the convent; there the aesthetic is timeless frumpiness, the appliances modern, the potatoes real. The revolutionary mob wear denim, hoodies and riot helmets. After fleeing the convent, Blanche\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s showdown with Marie, the nun designated as her protector, is unbearably naturalistic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and all the more upsetting \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as an encounter between two women now clad in jeggings and anoraks. They fight, they weep, a saucepan is thrown in frustration. Only the final scene, as the nuns go one by one to their deaths, threatens hyperbole. The amplified guillotine is jaw-achingly loud and each execution accompanied by a pair of shoes then fired across the stage. What haunts me is instead the tiny gesture of Blanche reaching for the hand of her fellow novice, Constance. The power of such scenes is testament to the remarkable performances of the cast and ever-excellent Glyndebourne Chorus. Karen Cargill\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Mother Marie is vocally ferocious, Golda Schultz\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s New Prioress her opposite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c warm and almost girlish. Katarina Dalayman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Old Prioress is utterly compelling, the seeming erotic undertones of her death truly disturbing, while Florie Valiquette\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Constance is sympathetic and crystal-toned. As Blanche, Sally Matthews convinces equally as wide-eyed aristocrat and religious martyr, her voice at times gritty with fury, elsewhere gleamingly beautiful. Crucially, such intense vocal declamation is offset by cool orchestral detachment. From the neat energy of the opening, the London Philharmonic Orchestra is exquisitely controlled by Robin Ticciati, the onstage violence framed by woodwind solos of heartbreaking delicacy and juste-milieu sensuality from the strings. Only the periodic snarls of brass and percussion hint at aggression suppressed and this ultra-stylised opera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s firm grip on reality. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Until 29 July."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/11/kevin-de-bruyne-savours-sweat-and-sacrifice-as-treble-dream-comes-true", "primaryCategory": "football", "title": "Kevin De Bruyne savours sweat and sacrifice as treble dream comes true | David Hytner", "lead": "While midfielder was forced off with injury in first half against Inter, he still epitomised Manchester City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fighting spirit", "author": "David Hytner in Istanbul", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T11:31:51Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764585", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/497246f4c6248f9b550f7a5ffe86da3617840926/147_0_3225_1935/500.jpg", "body": "Kevin De Bruyne\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wife, Mich\u00c3\u00a8le Lacroix, was not worried. She knew that Manchester City would beat Internazionale on Saturday night to win their first Champions League title. She was convinced it was their destiny. She has been all season. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know why my wife said in August: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to win the Champions League,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but she always maintained I would,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd De Bruyne said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She said before the game: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcYou\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be fine, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll win it.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 In the end, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little bit of a shame because I have to tell her she was right. So that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not the best.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It did not go as De Bruyne had dreamed it on a personal level. The midfielder has managed a hamstring problem since the quarter-final second leg at Bayern Munich on 19 April. In the red zone with minor tears, he was told there was a danger it could go completely, which it did, forcing him off in the 36th minute. De Bruyne had been strong\u00e2\u20ac\u2018armed out of City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only previous Champions League final against Chelsea in 2021, Antonio R\u00c3\u00bcdiger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s notorious upper body check leaving him with a broken nose, fractured eye socket and concussion. So a treble of sorts. De Bruyne will have a scan but he knows that grade three hamstring tears mean up to three months out. This is what can happen when you push your body through 57 games for club and country over a punishing season. As heads cleared after City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1-0 win, Inter broken by Rodri\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 68th-minute goal and Ederson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resistance at the end, it felt as though there was something in the notion of destiny. An hour or so after the final whistle, as Pep Guardiola waited for a lift in the bowels of the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in between media commitments, gold winners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 medal around his neck, he could not help but stare at a nearby TV. It was showing the replays of Romelu Lukaku\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 89th-minute header, the one that the Inter substitute had met unmarked at close range. And he still put it too close to Ederson, who blocked with his legs, R\u00c3\u00baben Dias completing the clearance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Can you believe Lukaku has not scored that?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guardiola was asked. It was unclear whether he heard the question. The City manager simply blew out his cheeks and turned towards the lift, a posse of luminous-bibbed stewards holding up their camera phones for selfies, Guardiola in the background as the doors closed. The excellent Federico Dimarco looped a header against the crossbar on 71 minutes and Ederson tipped over another header, this one from the substitute Robin Gosens, at the very last. But Lukaku\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s header felt like the moment for Inter. On another day, it goes in. Or maybe it rebounds off Dias and goes in. Not this time. City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s triumph felt like the counterpoint to their undeserved semi-final defeat to Real Madrid last season. Or the agony of the VAR-dictated exit against Tottenham in the 2019 quarter-final. The 2021 final was a part of it, too. City were not their usual selves against Inter, especially in the first half when they lacked aggression and Rodri could get nothing going. Their opponents played above themselves, Simone Inzaghi getting his tactics spot on. City had gears to move up and into but they did not really do so. Then again, Champions League finals that clinch trebles are not to be played, they are to be won, as some other mob could tell them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was written in the stars,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Guardiola said or, certainly, in City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s muscle memory. There were colourful scenes afterwards, in the dressing room and into the mixed zone, the area through which players and staff walk in front of the media before boarding the team bus. You heard Jack Grealish before you saw him, the winger striding through with Fleetwood Mac\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Everywhere blaring from a boom box. Erling Haaland pretended to snore as he waited for Rodri to finish an interview; the centre-forward was next and then he was not because he did not want to wait any longer. John Stones wandered through with a Heineken. Would he stop for a chat? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Guys, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not had a beer for 11 months!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he replied. In other words, let me have this moment. Kyle Walker smiled broadly. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just want to say: \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThank you,\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he offered, with a flourish. For the City support in Istanbul, there are memories that will never die, the chaotic nature of the place somehow amplifying them. After Liverpool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2005 triumph here, fans experienced 10-hour delays at Sabiha Gokcen airport and it reached a point where a ticket to any airport in England was enough; flights were boarded like buses. Manchester, London, it did not matter. The authorities almost lost control, their only soothing move to play You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll Never Walk Alone over the public address system. It was not that bad for City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s followers, although the schlep in and out of the Ataturk stadium by road was a test. This is Istanbul, a city where the traffic is a nightmare and a marvel, where seat belts in the back of high-speed, quick-breaking taxis appear as optional as motorcycle helmets, and where two cars into one lane somehow go. De Bruyne epitomised the all-for-one spirit, giving everything he had to drive the journey to its end point. There were times after his substitution when it looked as though he was the assistant manager on the touchline. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been struggling with the injury since Bayern Munich away,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd De Bruyne said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was all small ruptures but here I snapped it all the way. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been told for two months there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a possibility I was at risk but, you know, you take it. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I was there for my team and did what I needed to do. I missed some games but the games like Arsenal, Bayern and Madrid \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I managed to do it. I had some personal things that happened with my family on top of that and I managed that. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shame it went the way it did for me but we go away winning the Champions League so there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing bad towards it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/11/my-imaginary-country-review-patricio-guzman-captures-chiles-new-wave-of-protest", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "My Imaginary Country review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Patricio Guzm\u00c3\u00a1n captures Chile\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new wave of protest", "lead": "The Chilean director follows up on his epic 70s documentary The Battle of Chile with this optimistic portrait of his country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s latest social uprising", "author": "Wendy Ide", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T11:30:49Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764587", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3b237e14b7861ca69c6353b8aaf62ac9f3ee775b/58_0_2595_1557/500.jpg", "body": "Nearly 50 years ago, the Chilean director Patricio Guzm\u00c3\u00a1n created a three-part documentary titled The Battle of Chile, which gave a detailed account of the civil unrest and the coup that tore the country apart during the 1970s.

A chaotic \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free for all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd outside the Atat\u00c3\u00bcrk Olympic Stadium caused buses full of fans, which had been laid on to return them to the centre of Istanbul, more than 15 miles away, to stand for more than an hour and a half before they could start to make the journey back, fans said. Some supporters of City and Internazionale said they were unable to even get on a bus and were charged as much as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 (\u00c2\u00a3256) for a taxi from the remote \u00c4\u00b0kitelli district on the far western outskirts of the sprawling Turkish city.

We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 (\u00c2\u00a3128) for a taxi there, too, as the queues for the shuttle buses going to the stadium were horrendous.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The final, won by a single goal by Manchester City, kicked off at a local time of 10pm to accommodate the demands of broadcasters. Many Manchester City fans had already endured an arduous journey to the stadium after being advised by Uefa not to use the Metro but to take buses laid on at the port quarter of Yenikap\u00c4\u00b1. Those who secured a seat on a bus between 1pm and 3pm spoke of a smooth system but fans arriving after 4pm faced queues of up to three hours to get a place. Many instead took taxis but the traffic ground to a standstill on the main road to the stadium leading to scenes of fans running down the highway as they tried to make kick-off. Uefa had organised fan zones at either end of the stadium, and City fans spoke of this being well-organised until one of three bars ran out of beer at 6pm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c four hours before the start of the game \u00e2\u20ac\u201c causing a crush. In the stadium, alcohol was not for sale and fans found they were charged as much as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 for a bottle of Pepsi, they said. A 68th-minute goal by the defensive midfielder Rodri sealed victory for City, and their first Champions League title. City are the second English club, after Manchester United in 1998-1999, to win the treble after this season\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s FA Cup and Premier League triumphs. Paul Cross, 51, a project manager from Preston, said it was a shame the occasion had been marred by a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free for all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd after the game. Such was the chaos that Cross said he walked for up to half an hour with others to a nearby village before ending up sharing a taxi with an Inter fan. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But they were staying close to the airport and so we had to get a taxi back from there as well,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We finally got here at 2.20am but there were still people coming back after 3am and later.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Simon Moore, 54, a firefighter from Accrington, was travelling with his sons Harry, 29, and Alfie, 18, and only returned to their hotel in Yenikap\u00c4\u00b1, where many City fans stayed, at 3.15am. One of their tickets cost \u00c2\u00a3188 and the two others \u00c2\u00a3512. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We thought the expensive tickets would have a special view but they were in the same area, really no different,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The stadium is good but it is just so far away from where people were staying. We waited to get on a bus and that was about 20 minutes, which was fine but then it just sat there for an hour and a half.

Whether they have been Blairites, Brownites, disciples of Jeremy Corbyn or servants of Keir Starmer, a certain kind of Labour high-up has always thrived on a loathing and mistrust of their internal enemies, and a drive to seize control of the party machine. What this entails is always the same: manic apparatchiks \u00e2\u20ac\u201c men, usually \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stalking around party offices, desperately trying to fix the selections of parliamentary candidates, and dispensing off-the-record briefings about whichever figures are deemed ready for liquidation. But on this score, as Boris Johnson causes yet more Tory chaos and Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chances of leading the next government solidify, the current leader and his team seem to be in a league of their own. First came the withdrawal of the Labour whip from Corbyn. Just over a week ago, Jamie Driscoll, the elected mayor of the North of Tyne area, was kept out of the running to lead the new north-east region, with no official notification of why, or any right of appeal (the reason given to the media is his appearance at an arts event alongside the film director Ken Loach, expelled from the party because of his membership of the proscribed organisation Labour Against the Witchhunt, which claimed that allegations of Labour antisemitism were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153politically motivated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). For the past year, meanwhile, less high-profile stories have been piling up about exclusions from parliamentary shortlists and meddling in local parties. As evidenced by the Driscoll and Corbyn cases, the people around Starmer often frame what they are doing in terms of rooting out antisemitism. But they also fill their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153due diligence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd charge-sheets with an array of other alleged transgressions. In doing so, they not only cheapen their case, but point to one inescapable conclusion: that what is going on is also about squashing anything and anyone deemed either too leftwing or in any way disobedient. There is no inconsistency in supporting Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newfound intolerance of anti-Jewish prejudice, while also wondering why unrelated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and completely trifling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c accusations are also cited, again and again, and boggling at a party so neglectful of both due process and consistent standards. Behaviour flagged as problematic has included liking tweets by the former Labour policy chief Andrew Fisher and the Green party MP Caroline Lucas, and giving an online thumbs up to the Occupy movement, which faded away a decade ago. In Milton Keynes, the reasons given by the party for excluding a would-be parliamentary candidate included liking one tweet by Nicola Sturgeon saying the Scottish first minister had recovered from Covid-19, and another that called Starmer a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prat\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A newly recruited Labour activist in the Cornish seat of Camborne and Redruth was contacted about past tweets expressing favourable opinions about senior Green party politicians \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and not just ruled out of the local candidate selection process, but expelled from the party (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Kafkaesque insanity,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said, not unreasonably). For others, whatever the talk from party insiders about the need for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153competent and professional\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd candidates, there have been only the lightest slaps on the wrist: the white leader of Barking and Dagenham council, Darren Rodwell, joked at a black history event that he had the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153worst tan possible for a black man\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but remained on a local parliamentary shortlist after being cleared of any wrongdoing, and is now a confirmed Labour candidate, recently heard suggesting that people should be evicted from social housing if their children do not inform on people who commit knife crime. Now, as looming boundary changes entail a new burst of selection contests, the stories are multiplying. In south Wales, for example, two sitting MPs had to recently undergo a selection contest for a new constituency spanning the current seats of Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and Cynon Valley. The result was nothing if not predictable: Starmer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shadow Wales minister, Gerald Jones, defeated the leftwinger Beth Winter, who says the contest was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bulldozed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd through in a fortnight, with no in-person hustings. Like Driscoll, she says she will be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking advice and soundings in the days ahead about my next steps\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but the machine grinds on. Beyond the eternal battle between Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right and left, the other thing that seems to incur the wrath of people at the top is members and activists being friendly towards other parties. In the Cherwell district of Oxfordshire, the results of May\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s council elections meant that the local Labour party could have formed a coalition with the Lib Dems, Greens and local independents, but negotiations apparently fell apart after an intervention by the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s national executive committee, handing power to a minority Tory administration. In the home counties borough of Hertsmere, meanwhile, the local party is still awaiting the NEC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision on whether or not to approve its deal with the Lib Dems, while Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional office has suspended two local activists from paid jobs in the party organisation, and withdrawn the party membership of two others. Their alleged crime, which they strenuously deny, is organising an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unauthorised electoral pact\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with another party \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in other words, trying to maximise Tory losses. In Westminster, there is one other element of the leadership\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behaviour: a briefing culture whose toxicity is increasing fast. Recent targets of Labour\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whisperers have included the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, her cabinet colleague Ed Miliband and the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whenever I go out there with something positive, the negative Westminster briefing machine somehow flicks into gear,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Burnham. Many Labour people seem to be miserably keeping their heads down, in case they, too, come to the attention of people who could yet bring their political careers to an abrupt end. It all feels like the opposite of the collective determination and excitement that ought to be cohering as the next election approaches, and prompts one obvious question: if things are this ugly when Labour is in opposition, what will happen if it actually takes power? When he ran for leader, Starmer claimed to believe in exactly the kind of politics that he and his people now appear to be set on destroying. He wanted, he said, to nationalise utilities, scrap tuition fees and put up income tax for high earners; at around the same time, he was filmed assuring Driscoll that he wanted to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unify the party\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, stop its factions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153taking lumps out of each other\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and create \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an environment in which people can respectfully disagree and come together\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is hard to keep up with someone so surreally changeable. But he and his people seem to think they can act with complete impunity, on the basis that anyone who wants a change of government will soon have to put their X in the usual box. Put another way, it is only our crooked electoral system that endows Labour with its political monopoly, and gives the fixers and apparatchiks their power. A lot of people in the party seem to understand that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is part of the reason why last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Labour conference voted to transform politics by embracing proportional representation. Starmer and his people, as you may recall, indicated that the decision would be ignored, and returned to the business at hand: command, control, and a kind of power so cold and cynical that you sometimes wonder if it has any content at all.

A friend and I had ventured to the Hite Marina on Lake Powell to see what America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s second-largest reservoir looked like after three years of record drought. In search of a camping spot, we drove down a boat ramp that just a few years earlier was bustling with boaters. Now it sat eerily on a dry lakebed. Donning headlamps, we walked past marooned docks and stranded buoys, drawn toward a strange roaring sound I thought was wind or a boat motor. Instead, it was something I never thought I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d witness. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Colorado River!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd my friend shouted in disbelief at how far the reservoir had already withdrawn. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s flowing!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This resurrection of a river that had been dammed to create the reservoir was a beautiful yet unsettling sight. The climate crisis was exposing flaws in a water system that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c after years of denial \u00e2\u20ac\u201c western states have finally been forced to confront. Over the following decade, I returned to Lake Powell many times to hike the slot canyons and tributaries emerging as drought shrunk the lake, watching a world long thought buried coming back to life. Lake Powell was created in 1963 to store water and provide hydropower for millions of people in western states. To do so, engineers built a 710ft-tall dam that severely limited the flow of the Colorado River, flooding Glen Canyon and forever altering one of the most ecologically and culturally rich areas in the south-western United States. The 180-mile canyon harbored unmatched riparian areas, side canyons and river tributaries, and thousands of ancient archaeological sites. The author and environmental activist Ed Abbey once called it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a portion of the Earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s original paradise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When I was growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, as Lake Powell was filling, the destruction of Glen Canyon was seen as an inevitable byproduct of progress \u00e2\u20ac\u201c collateral damage for the comfortable lifestyle that I and the millions of others in the arid south-west enjoyed. In the 1980s and 1990s, as the full reservoir became a world-famous houseboating destination, Glen Canyon existed only in photographs and the quixotic dreams of environmentalists. Then the climate crisis kicked in. During my 2003 visit, dwindling water levels had already moved Lake Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boundary several miles from Hite, allowing parts of the Colorado River once buried underwater to flow freely as they once did. Today, 20 years into what scientists have deemed a once-in-a-millennium megadrought, Lake Powell\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s receding shoreline is a full 12 miles from the abandoned marina, which stands as a ghostly reminder of a bygone era. The surface area of Lake Powell has already shrunk by nearly two thirds. More than 100,000 acres of Glen Canyon have now emerged from its depths, revealing an area larger than Arches national park filled with twisting slickrock canyons, waterfalls, streams and alcoves. Despite a wet winter and a breakthrough deal struck between Arizona, Nevada and California to reduce their water use, the status of Lake Powell \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which hit a record low this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remains precarious. Its downstream sister, Lake Mead, is equally low, sitting at about one-third full. Amid a frenzy of political fights and anxious water managers, environmental groups see a long-awaited opportunity. For decades, they have argued for restoring the spectacular landscape of Glen Canyon to its former glory. One such scenario, they argue, would involve designating Glen Canyon a national park and allowing the water stored in Lake Powell to flow downstream along the Colorado to Lake Mead, consolidating water resources and gaining an iconic crown jewel in the process. . It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an idea that makes sense to Eric Balken, the executive director of the Glen Canyon Institute. His Salt Lake City-based group first pitched a new future for Lake Powell in 1996, and he says the current water crisis has made their ideas sound a little less crazy. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When both Lake Powell and Lake Mead were full in the 1990s, draining Powell to restore Glen Canyon was viewed as a looney idea,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Balken. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Once it became clear there would never be enough water to fill both reservoirs, we have argued that all the water should go into Lake Mead so we can get Glen Canyon back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The question for advocates like Balken is not whether Lake Powell will shrink \u00e2\u20ac\u201c climate change and growing water demands are already guaranteeing that. Instead, they ask, could the federal government and the American public embrace a new paradigm \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one that values protecting a recovering ecosystem over a shrinking reservoir that is no longer able to deliver on its intended uses? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to think of Glen Canyon as a national park rather than a storage tank,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Balken. A re-emerging landscape With sheer cliffs rising a thousand feet, natural sandstone bridges, cavernous alcoves and towering buttes, Glen Canyon is said to have been as spectacular as the Grand Canyon. Though unlike the perilous rapids in the Grand Canyon \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which lies sandwiched between Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the river through Glen Canyon was gentle, an oasis beckoning around every bend. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In this dreamlike voyage any unnecessary effort seems foolish,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd wrote Abbey about a trip he took down the river in the early 1960s, when the dam was under construction. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The river itself sets the tone: utterly relaxed, completely at ease.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The idea of turning Glen Canyon into a national park was first proposed in 1936 by the US interior secretary Harold Ickes. Escalante national park, as he called it, seemed a natural fit after the establishment of Arches national park in 1929 and Zion and Grand Canyon in 1919, but the idea was ultimately crushed by ranching and mining interests in Utah. Instead, Glen Canyon became the site of the last major dam project of the Bureau of Reclamation, the federal agency responsible for managing the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s water supply and reservoir infrastructure. The structure was designed to generate hydropower and store extra water for the Colorado River\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s upper basin states of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming. About 1.25m acres of federal land encompassing Lake Powell were designated a national recreation area, becoming a popular spot for motor boating, camping and fishing. However, once the floodgates closed and widely published photos of Glen Canyon served as a kind of obituary for the spectacular landscape, many Americans became outraged. The loss was a catalyst for launching the modern environmental movement in the United States and preventing the construction of two dams planned in Grand Canyon. After my 2003 visit to Hite, I became enthralled with the chance to see the impossible and embarked on a years-long exploration of Glen Canyon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s emerging landscape. The first years of drought left a dystopian scene of impassible mud flats, abandoned houseboat parts and thorny non-native plants. But over time, flash floods swept that away, allowing streams to trickle over scoured slickrock, springs to seep from fern-decked canyon walls and waterfalls to tumble over ledges. As I hiked through more than a dozen of the same tributaries over a period of years, I saw native willow and cottonwoods saplings take root and all manner of wildlife species return, from dragonflies to beavers to bobcats. Fifty feet above my head, the white stripe of the reservoir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high water mark lined canyon walls, a bizarre reminder of where boats once floated. Despite nearly two decades of anecdotal observations, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only recently that scientists have begun documenting Glen Canyon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recovery from an ecological and archaeological perspective. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In locations that have been exposed since 2000 or 2011, substantial restoration of riparian ecosystems has already occurred,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the biologist Seth Arens during a March 2023 presentation to the Utah Native Plant Society. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hanging gardens [fed by springs seeping from canyon walls] are growing in isolated locations and thriving riparian ecosystems with extensive stands of willow and cottonwood exist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of the most surprising aspects has been the rediscovery of long-buried archaeological sites and artifacts. Prior to the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s completion, archaeologists documented some 2,000 archaeological sites, mostly from Ancestral Puebloans who lived in the area from about 300 BC until 1250 AD. Many such sites were eventually buried by the reservoir and declared officially \u00e2\u20ac\u0153destroyed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd by the National Park Service. The Navajo Nation also lost a large portion of their historic homeland, sheep grazing areas, burial grounds and sacred springs to the flooding. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Traditional practices were disrupted by the dam,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the Navajo Nation anthropologist Erik Stanfield. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But now sites are re-emerging and it offers an opportunity for Navajo people to reconnect.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A recent survey by National Park Service and Museum of Northern Arizona archaeologists of sites re-emerging from the waters found that 30 locations once deemed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153destroyed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are still fully or partially intact. One site contained a complete pot with its original yucca cord attached. It had survived 50 years underwater. Stanfield went on an exploratory trip last fall with Glen Canyon Institute staff and found that, while many dwellings below the reservoir\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high water mark had been reduced to rubble, several walls and stairs remained intact, as well as faint rock art. They also discovered well-preserved pottery sherds, metate grinding stones, chipping tools and loom post holes. However, Stanfield says restoring Glen Canyon is not that simple for the Navajo Nation. The tribe gets a portion of its electricity from the inexpensive hydropower generated by the dam, and it also operates Antelope Point Marina, a popular destination with a boat ramp, rentals, restaurants and shops and a rare source of jobs for the economically depressed Navajo reservation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some members value a return to traditional practices and protecting cultural sites. Others want to be able to enjoy a modern lifestyle and provide economic opportunity to the tribe,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd explains Stanfield. Approaching a reckoning Last fall, Lake Powell was hurtling toward a dangerous precipice. Dwindling water supply had put the lake close to dropping below the level needed to generate hydropower, and the Bureau of Reclamation was running out of options. It sent as much water as possible into Powell from Colorado River reservoirs above the lake, and withheld downstream releases to the extent that was legally allowed. An unusually wet winter saved the west\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faltering reservoir system in the nick of time. But a catastrophic failure of the dam\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s power operations remains within the realm of possibility, according to Bureau of Reclamation modeling \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and no long-term scenario for how to deal with it exists. Auxiliary tunnels designed to move water downstream if levels keep dropping may not be structurally sound to handle a constant flow. If Powell drops below these lower tunnels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c reaching a state called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dead pool\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c water would cease to flow downstream at all. Rather than struggling to keep both Powell and Mead partially full and barely able to generate hydropower, Glen Canyon Institute and other environmental groups advocate for re-engineering the dam so that water can pass through or around it at river level \u00e2\u20ac\u201c allowing the Colorado to flow freely all the way to Mead. This would require the federal government to decommission the hydropower operation, a supplier of electricity to 5 million customers in seven western states. Balken says Glen Canyon national recreation area should be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153reimagined\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as a national park that prioritizes river rafting, hiking and the preservation of ecological resources and cultural sites. He points out that 40 miles of Cataract Canyon, a legendary whitewater section of the Colorado with rapids to rival the Grand Canyon, have already resurfaced and become a bucket-list rafting trip. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So much of the current Colorado River story is about depletion and decline,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adds Balken. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But in Glen Canyon we have this opportunity of rebirth and getting something back.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an appealing silver lining. But would getting rid of Lake Powell be truly feasible, or would it create a different sort of catastrophe? Some scientists warn there could be unanticipated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even disastrous \u00e2\u20ac\u201c consequences to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153run of river\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario that environmental groups are asking for. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would love to see the Colorado River of old but these are extremely complicated issues that have very significant impacts all the way through the system,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Jack Schmidt, director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153If you fully drained Powell, it would be a mess in the near term.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Although the side canyons in Glen have proven resilient in returning to something near a pre-dam state, Schmidt says letting the main channel of the Colorado River run free is a different scenario because of all the sediment that is currently held back by the dam and the unpredictable terrain beneath the reservoir. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You would likely have collapsing banks, rock fall blocking the river\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s course and Grand Canyon would be inundated with sediment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ironically, he says, the Grand Canyon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ecology has adapted to the artificial, sediment-free environment created by the dam. Returning the Colorado River ecosystem to its former state could put the Grand Canyon at risk by imperiling native plant and fish species and eroding river banks containing archaeological sites, according to Schmidt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to have a significant societal debate about whether to store most of our water in Lake Powell or in Lake Mead,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Schmidt. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do we want to prioritize protecting the resources in Glen Canyon or in Grand Canyon?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The day for that reckoning is fast approaching. Last October, I accompanied a group of 15 students from Northern Arizona University on a field trip to Lake Powell. We toured the Glen Canyon dam visitor center with its outdated interpretive displays touting the marvels of hydropower and water storage, even though just outside the lake had fallen by more than 150ft. These students in their early 20s have lived their entire lives in a world where Lake Powell has been dropping and the climate crisis has been worsening. And they are fed up by the lack of action from people my age who could have addressed the water crisis and global warming decades ago. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The way the south-west has been developed with no regard for long term environmental repercussions shows an extreme lack of humility by older generations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Alex Torgler, 25. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They built things simply because they could.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In addition to touring the dam and walking across dry lakebeds, the students kayaked and hiked up Antelope Canyon where Powell had receded. The twisting, narrow canyon was filled with native plants lining a newly flowing stream. In their minds, the best path forward seems obvious: letting the river flow freely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Natural processes have been maintaining the resource of Glen Canyon a lot better than humans have,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Torgler. As the debate about Colorado River cutbacks rages on, some things remain certain.

The rise in delays came despite the number of fraud cases coming through the courts dropping to barely a third of 2014 levels, according to the analysis by the Criminal Bar Association (CBA). In the final quarter of 2022, there were 447 fraud cases, which took on average a record 497 days to complete from charge. By comparison, it took 242 days on average for the 1,294 fraud cases that were completed between October and December 2014. In 2022, one in 15 adults were victims of fraud. There were 3.7m fraud offences in the year to September 2022, according to the England and Wales crime survey, accounting for about 40% of all crimes. In the year ending March 2021, Action Fraud received victim reports totalling a loss of \u00c2\u00a32.35bn while the cost to society of fraud against individuals is believed to be approximately \u00c2\u00a37bn a year. However, the number of fraud prosecutors dropped from 221 in 2015 to 167 in 2021. Last year, the then business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, was accused of being disrespectful to victims of scammers after he defended Boris Johnson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s claim that crime was falling by 14% \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which was only true if fraud was excluded (otherwise crime was rising). Kirsty Brimelow KC, the CBA chair, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The whole criminal justice system is in crisis. There are too many cases and not enough barristers and not enough court staff to manage the listing of cases. Defendants often are on bail in fraud cases and so their cases will wait for the completion of those cases where defendants are remanded in custody. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153With a backlog of over 60,000 cases [for all crimes in crown courts], the delays are getting longer. There also is a lack of judges who try fraud cases. Slashing of money into the criminal justice system has created a perfect storm. It is victims of crime and, in fraud, the economy that suffers,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Brimelow said. The CBA found delays were even worse for fraud cases where the defendant was on bail. In the last quarter of 2022, 268 cases of bailed defendants on trial for fraud offences concluded, taking a record 632 days on average. Only rape trials involving bailed defendants took as long to complete in the crown courts. In 2014, the 833 fraud trials that completed between October and December took 291 days on average. The shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153According to the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own fraud strategy, published last month, there is only one prosecution for every thousand fraud offences committed in England and Wales, and what this latest analysis reveals is that even those fraud cases that do result in charges are taking years to complete. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We desperately require root and branch reform of our country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s entire approach to tackling the fraud crisis, including making it easier and quicker to prosecute the criminals responsible.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A government spokesperson said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These figures demonstrate the impact of the pandemic and last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s industrial action on the wider outstanding court caseload \u00e2\u20ac\u201c given completion times for fraud cases were broadly stable up to the end of 2019. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve since taken decisive action to speed up cases going through the system, including lifting the number of days courts can sit and recruiting more judges, so victims can get the swift access to justice they deserve.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The CBA said delays had continued to rise post-pandemic despite fewer cases and its industrial action \u00e2\u20ac\u0153merely highlighted pre-existing delays in a chronically underfunded criminal justice system\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/11/evelyn-hofer-photographers-gallery-london-a-total-perfectionist", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcA total perfectionist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: the understated, underrated photography of Evelyn Hofer", "lead": "With a retrospective in London and many artists today citing her as an influence, the work of the German-American photographer is getting recognition at last", "author": "Sean O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hagan", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T11:00:50Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764600", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/a647adb81ecbee282430de61b52306b32ca8a3cf/0_637_4961_2976/500.jpg", "body": "In 1982, on the occasion of an Evelyn Hofer exhibition at the Witkin Gallery in Manhattan, Hilton Kramer, art critic of the New York Times, asked: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Is it possible in this age of publicity for a photographer to be both famous and obscure at the same time?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In an age of information overload, that remains, to a degree, a pertinent question. Hofer, who died aged 87 in 2009, is one of those quiet but accomplished photographers whose importance has taken considerable time to accrue. When Kramer wrote his review, championing her as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the most illustrious of living photographers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Hofer was 60, but, as Kramer pointed out, not one of her works featured in the Museum of Modern Art\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extensive permanent photography collection. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She seems not even to have been heard of,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he wrote, sounding personally affronted. Self-Portrait with Gigi, 1974. Much has changed, though slowly, in the interim. Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s poised and attentive colour portraits now feature in museum collections worldwide, and in recent years there have been retrospectives devoted to her work in Switzerland, Ireland and the Netherlands. Yet while photographers such as Thomas Struth, Rineke Dijkstra and Alec Soth have acknowledged her influence, Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work has not inspired a wave of popular attention like the one that attended the posthumous reappraisal of her male contemporary and fellow colour pioneer Saul Leiter. The reasons for this are complex, and not just to do with Hofer being overlooked by a male-dominated photography culture. In her lifetime she was best known for a series of evocative travel books, published between 1959 and 1967 in collaboration with well-known writers: Mary McCarthy (The Stones of Florence); VS Pritchett (London Perceived; New York Proclaimed; Dublin: A Portrait) and Jan Morris (The Presence of Spain). Clare Grafik, co-curator of a long-overdue British retrospective of Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work, which opens at the Photographers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Gallery, London, later this month, thinks that the perceived commerciality of these commissions may have initially worked against Hofer being taken seriously as an artist. Car Park, New York, 1965. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Her colour work, particularly her portraits of people in their urban settings, is so extraordinary that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to understand why she is not more well known and appreciated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Grafik says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Through those books Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work undoubtedly reached a lot of people, [but] many readers perhaps did not take that much notice of the photographs other than as illustrations of the writing. In art circles there may have also been a latent snobbery towards her because she was seen as a commercial photographer, but working on the travel books is how she developed her own style.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The forthcoming exhibition makes clear that Hofer was a formally brilliant photographer of people, places, environments and objects. Looking at her colour portraits of ordinary people in 1960s Dublin and New York, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s difficult to think of any other photographer who so evoked the atmosphere of those cities while creating images that are so rigorous and richly hued. Her Dublin exudes a muted, melancholy atmosphere, while New York is vibrant with the suggestion of life and colour even in the stillness she imposes on her subjects. Springtime, Washington, 1965. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Her images are incredibly subtle in every regard,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Grafik, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and there is a lack of possessiveness in her approach. You can sense the delicate balance in the relationship between her and her subjects.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hofer photographed people individually or in small groups on the streets, using an unwieldy 4x5in (10x12cm) Linhof Technika view camera that required a degree of patience and engagement from both her and her subjects. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She was always studying the light,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Andreas Pauly, her former assistant and executor of her estate, told the New York Times in 2010. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She had a little notebook and would write down when the light would be good, then she would come back at that time. It was rare she set up a camera and did something quickly.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The results are the polar opposite of traditional street photography, being still, poised and deftly composed rather than frantic, snatched and fly-on-the-wall. In one memorable image she posed a tough-looking motorcycle cop beneath a blossoming cherry tree, making you wonder about the preceding conversation between the macho guy and the diminutive woman with the huge, cumbersome camera. Girl With Bicycle, Dublin, 1966. Grafik describes Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153environmental portraiture\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, citing its stylistic resemblance to August Sander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more austere work in Weimar Germany. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There are whispers of Sander\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s style in her monochrome portrait of three gravediggers in Dublin, for instance, but Hofer photographs people in their settings in a way that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t reduce them to their function. There is often an interesting complicity between her and her subjects, as in her wonderful colour portrait of four Irish footballers standing in a row. There is a slight glint in their eyes, as if they know they are performing for her camera.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Like all Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subjects, though, they are performing quietly, responding to her unassuming presence and precise instructions. Her photograph of a young girl in Dublin, standing astride an adult-sized bicycle, is both a portrait and a landscape. It is also a study in attentiveness: the smartly dressed subject bathed in sunlight and shadow on a street that is eerily empty \u00e2\u20ac\u201c perhaps it was a Sunday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c save for an uninterested dog in the background. The composition is echoed in Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portrait of a young man posing cooly on a racing bike in a New York park, the towering Queensboro Bridge looming in the background. In both instances, the gaze of the photographer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s subject is calmly quizzical. Four Young Men, Washington, 1968. Born in Marburg, Germany in 1922, Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s early life was disrupted by the rise of nazism, her family fleeing to Geneva, Switzerland in 1933 when she was 11. She began her career with an apprenticeship at a Swiss portrait studio before taking private lessons from the influential teacher and photographer Hans Finsler, a member of the new objectivity movement. He taught her the theory and practice of photography, but also technical expertise, including the chemistry of print-making, a grounding that would underpin her later mastery of the complex dye transfer printing process that gave her colour images such rich, deep tones. In 1946, Hofer settled in New York, having also lived in Spain and Mexico. There she began working for Harper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bazaar under its celebrated art director Alexey Brodovitch, and befriended the artists Saul Steinberg and Richard Lindner, who, she said, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153showed me how to look\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Her still lifes artfully arranged objects echo the paintings of 17th-century Dutch masters. Grafik finds it revealing that Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s close friends were painters: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153They were creating their own world, not relying, like photographers, on the outside world to come to them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Queensboro Bridge, New York, 1964. At some point in the mid-50s, Hofer met the writer Mary McCarthy, who asked her to provide the images for The Stones of Florence, a literary meditation on the Italian city\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture, art and history. So began perhaps the most creatively fertile decade of Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s working life, with a subsequent, more sustained collaboration with VS Pritchett producing atmospheric books on London, New York and Dublin. With hindsight, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s clear that Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s technical skill and aesthetic judgment elevated this work to the level of art photography. She returned to editorial work in the late 60s, working for Time and Life magazines. In the 70s she shot several extended photo essays for the Sunday Times, including one on British prisons and another on life in Crossmaglen, a staunchly republican village in south Armagh, at the height of the Troubles. \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLittle Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, Mulberry Street, New York, 1965. Throughout, Hofer remained an intensely private individual. Elisabeth Biondi, erstwhile visuals editor of the New Yorker, commissioned Hofer for several Vanity Fair pieces in the late 1980s, including one in which she photographed the interior of Andy Warhol\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s apartment after the artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death. Biondi and Hofer became friends. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t close, but we got on,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Biondi, laughing. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Charm was not Evelyn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strong point. She had a German exactness that I recognised in myself, and she could be stubborn to the point of infuriating, but she was a total perfectionist. Her aesthetic reflected that: she was constantly seeking technical perfection alongside beauty, and to that end her photographs are calm and totally balanced compositionally. When you commissioned her, you knew she would deliver work to the highest standard.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now and then, Biondi caught a glimpse of Hofer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life outside photography. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She lived alone in a building that had once been a kind of artist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s colony in the West Village. She was very independent, and her apartment, like her life, was meticulously ordered. I know there was a relationship with someone in the past but she did not talk about it. One sensed that, to fall back on the old cliche, she was married to her work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so much so it would probably have been difficult to be her partner.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Biondi pauses for a moment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153For Evelyn, the work was her life.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Evelyn Hofer is at the Photographers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Gallery, London, 23 June-24 September"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/11/joe-biden-mental-health-pro-trump-campaign", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "The pro-Trump campaign attacking Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental health is ramping back up", "lead": "The president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cognitive ability, a conservative media concern, has increasingly become more mainstream", "author": "Nick Robins-Early", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T11:00:49Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764602", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/c3bb196d5af7f8f938fdcb5d7368e2fc49710463/0_0_3000_1800/500.jpg", "body": "In 2019, a manipulated video spread through social media platforms showing Joe Biden on stage telling an audience that he \u00e2\u20ac\u0153shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be president\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

As Biden, now 80 years old, prepares for the 2024 presidential race, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s likely that his age and mental faculties will be a primary target for conservatives during the campaign. AI-generated audio tools have also made it easier for anyone with a basic digital skill set to manipulate Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s persona, while his history of real-life gaffes, verbal stumbles connected to a lifelong speech impediment and limited news conferences provide plenty of ammunition for speculative claims he has mentally declined. Although asking whether the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oldest-ever president is fit for a grueling and mentally demanding job is a reasonable question, much of this narrative has relied on either specious allegations or outright deception. The altered 2019 clip of Biden, for instance, was made by prolific far-right meme-maker and ardent Trump supporter Logan \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Carpe Donktum\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Cook. At the time, Cook had partnered with Ali Alexander \u00e2\u20ac\u201c later one of the key figures behind the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stop the Steal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd movement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to launch a Maga influencer site. Videos like Cook\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s became part of a pipeline that saw Maga supporters or Republican operatives create content that would then move through rightwing media and get amplified by campaign officials or Trump himself. At times in-office government officials or Republican party organizations directly engaged in promoting this content. In one case from 2020, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s White House social media director, Dan Scavino, tweeted out a manipulated video that made it falsely appear as if Biden had fallen asleep during a media interview with a local news station. The video, which Photoshopped captions and edited together footage, was originally created by a meme-making Maga supporter before being picked up by Scavino. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign or Republican officials also made their own content. Over the course of just one month in the summer of 2020, Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign ran more than a thousand Facebook and Instagram ads with various slogans attacking Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental abilities. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you think Joe Biden is old &amp; out of it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd one of the social media ads asked. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do you think Joe Biden has the mental fortitude to be president?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd another read, linking to a poll on the Trump campaign site. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s campaign created four separate video ads suggesting Biden was mentally diminished, including one titled \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What happened to Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that took clips of him speaking fluently while vice-president and juxtaposed them with verbal stumbles on the campaign trail. One televised ad that ran in 12 states announced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Joe Biden is slipping.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump began repeating the attacks during media interviews, insinuating Democrats were covering something up. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Biden is shot. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m telling you he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shot. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something going on,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump told Fox News in August 2020. These attacks kept up during Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s presidency and last year a group of 54 Republican lawmakers wrote an open letter to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153express concern\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with the president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153current cognitive state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and demand that Biden take a mental fitness test. The letter cited the Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Association\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signs of mental decline before listing a series of Biden gaffes and polling on his mental state. (Biden has a well-documented stutter which creates frequent verbal gaffes and repetitions, making it fairly easy to find videos of him stumbling over his words.) Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physician released a five-page summary of his current health status in February, detailing some issues such as arthritis and a need to take blood thinners, but describing him as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153healthy, vigorous, 80-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. But such internal assessments have not stopped Republican attacks, while incidents like Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s onstage fall last week at the Air Force Academy commencement have fueled rightwing news cycles that Democrats are hiding his infirmity and legacy media outlets are acting as apologists. On social media, the Republican National Committee created an account that served as an attack dog against the Biden administration. The @RNCResearch account has repeatedly promoted the idea that Biden is in mental decline and last year tweeted out a misleading video that took several seconds of out-of-context footage from Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s trip to Israel and framed it to make the president look lost and confused. Fox News and other rightwing media networks have also kept a steady drumbeat of claims. The former Fox News host Tucker Carlson ran a segment last year alleging a Democratic party conspiracy to hide that Biden was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cognitively unable to serve\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, while host Sean Hannity told viewers earlier this year that Biden was showing signs of dementia and was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153plagued by his own cognitive decline\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dementia\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd claims have been amplified further by conservative media across platforms like Rumble, while the immensely popular podcast host Joe Rogan \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a longtime promoter of baseless conspiracy theories \u00e2\u20ac\u201c told his millions of dedicated listeners last year that Biden was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153basically a shell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd cognitively. Clips of Rogan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comments were then featured by rightwing outlets such as the Daily Caller, giving them even more reach. One of the reasons that Republicans and Trump supporters have spent so much time and resources pushing the idea of Biden-in-decline may be that it seems to be a genuine polling liability for Biden, especially when compared with perceptions of Donald Trump. Despite Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history of nonsensical statements and free-associating speeches, and the fact that he is only a few years younger than Biden, he has consistently scored much higher on surveys asking about his mental acuity and energy levels. A Pew Research poll in 2020 found that Trump had a 16-point lead over Biden when it came to being described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153energetic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and a Washington Post-ABC News poll from May found 76-year-old Trump had a 22-point advantage over Biden when it came to perceptions of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mental sharpness\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Although Democrats haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waged the same level of attacks against Trump, the former president did face similar questions about his cognitive abilities while in office, with pundits like MSNBC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Joe Scarborough claiming his generally erratic behavior was the result of dementia. The speculation grew to the point that he took the Montreal Cognitive Assessment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a 10-minute psychological exam of simplistic questions to determine medical issues like signs of neurological impairment \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which he repeatedly bragged about performing well on. That Trump felt pressured to take the test is also part of the rightwing grievance against Biden, often framed as evidence that Democrats aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t being fair or have something to hide. If either Trump or Biden win the presidency next year they will both be in their 80s by the time their term is up, but there is already a rightwing ecosystem in place attempting to make the age and mental abilities of the candidates solely focused on Biden. The latest polls on Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mental abilities and the onset of the 2024 campaign have already revitalized attacks and given a sense of what the next year and a half might look like. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153President Biden announces his reelection campaign, but Americans say \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 HE\u00e2\u20ac\u2122S ALREADY LOST IT!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd the New York Post\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front page blared last month, alongside a Photoshopped image of a deranged-looking Biden peering out from behind window curtains."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/11/from-cranks-to-contenders-how-spains-far-right-vox-party-is-rising-toward-power", "primaryCategory": "world", "title": "From \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccranks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 to contenders: how Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s far-right Vox party is rising toward power", "lead": "Once dismissed as anachronistic, the radical party hopes to ride a wave of patriotism in next month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s elections.

The pair, and their far-right party, have much to smile about in the wake of last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s municipal and regional polls in Spain and in the run-up to July\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s snap general election. Robles\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quiet, hyper-local campaign \u00e2\u20ac\u201c waged in stark contrast to the strident, vituperative and sometimes openly xenophobic electoral tone in which Vox has come to specialise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c looks set to deliver the party its first mayoralty in the region, if he can secure the agreement of other parties. Far more importantly, however, Vox is now poised to enter more regional governments and could even form part of the national government if, as expected, the conservative People\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s party (PP) falls well short of an absolute majority on 23 July and has to rely on the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s support to take office. The PP has so far refused to rule out any deals with Vox. Such a scenario would have been unthinkable even five years ago \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as would the fact that Vox is now the third largest party in Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 350-seat congress. Founded almost a decade ago by a disenchanted faction of the PP who felt the conservatives had become too soft and who wanted to see Spain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regional governments dissolved and power returned to the centre, the party was dismissed for a long time as a bunch of nostalgic, anachronistic and unelectable cranks. Stunts such as unfurling a massive Spanish flag on the rock of Gibraltar did little to dispel that impression, nor did the tweets from the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then-leader in Andaluc\u00c3\u00ada about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153psychopathic feminazis\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and women who were too ugly to be gang-raped. But all that started to change six years ago when the failed push for Catalan independence pitched Spain into its worst political and territorial crisis in decades. Miguel Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez, an El Pa\u00c3\u00ads journalist who covers Vox and is the author of a book on the party titled Vox Inc: the Business of Spanish Patriotism, says the explosion of long-running tensions between Catalonia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pro-independence regional government and the Spanish state awakened a long-dormant strain of nationalism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say there was an ashamed Spanish nationalism that was ashamed precisely because that nationalism had been used by Franco during the entire dictatorship,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That nationalism had pretty much only manifested itself during football matches when Spain was playing. But the whole Catalan issue was very important emotionally as well as politically. There are a lot of people who felt personally hurt over what happened in Catalonia, and that awoke that Spanish nationalism that had been latent.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Add to that the social, economic and demographic factors in play in Spain and many other European countries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ageing populations, fears about immigration, and digital and equality revolutions that have left many people feeling left behind \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the conditions for Vox were ripe. As Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez points out, straight lines can be drawn between the convulsions in Catalonia and the rise of Vox. Perceptions that the PP government of Mariano Rajoy had been too soft and too slow to react to the Catalan independence movement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and that the party had become too corrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u201c also played a part. The Andaluc\u00c3\u00adan elections of December 2018, which came six months after Rajoy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government had been kicked out of office via a Socialist-led no-confidence vote, saw Vox break through and take 12 seats in the regional parliament. Four months later \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the first of 2019\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two general elections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Vox gained a foothold in the parliament after winning 24 seats. That first election coincided with the trial of 12 Catalan regional government and civic leaders over their role in the push to secede from Spain. The November general election, in which Vox more than doubled its seat count to 52, was fought amid the unrest in Catalonia that met the jailing of nine of the 12 independence leaders. But the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest coup to date came in March last year when the PP cut a deal with Vox to govern the north-western region of Castilla y Le\u00c3\u00b3n as a coalition. The pact may have made the PP uneasy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not least because of Vox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s efforts to set an anti-abortion agenda in the region \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but it gave Vox the keys to power and whetted its appetite for more. While Vox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s leader, Santiago Abascal, is hoping his party will be able to pressure his PP counterpart, Alberto N\u00c3\u00ba\u00c3\u00b1ez Feij\u00c3\u00b3o, into more coalition regional governments following last month\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s polls, his eye is now firmly on national government. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s aim is to get into the Spanish government,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Abascal wants to be the [equivalent of Italy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Matteo] Salvini; he wants to be deputy prime minister in a Feij\u00c3\u00b3o government. Vox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s whole strategy is focused on that outcome.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd One of Vox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s greatest achievements has been the normalisation of views that would, until very recently, have jarred in a country that has long prided itself on being tolerant, progressive and immune to nationalism. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Vox is an ultra-nationalist party \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the best definition,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Within Vox, you have sectors that came from the fascist Falange party and ultra-Catholic sectors that are pro-life and absolutely against abortion and gay marriage.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd But on the streets of Rascafr\u00c3\u00ada \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and in many other villages, towns and cities across Spain \u00e2\u20ac\u201c its supporters tend to dwell less on its ideological extremes than on the prospect it offers them of a break from the socialist and PP duopoly that has governed Spain for the past five decades. For Romualdo and Luis, two Rascafr\u00c3\u00ada residents standing outside a cafe on one of the town\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s main streets, the recent municipal election had been more about local services and investment than a clash of radically different political visions. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about the candidate here, not the party,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Romualdo. For Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Luis Garc\u00c3\u00ada, who has had a house in Rascafr\u00c3\u00ada for almost 40 years, much of Vox\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s appeal lies in what it is not. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think this town has been abandoned for the last two or three legislatures,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nothing for the kids to do here. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re out on the streets all bloody day. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a Vox voter and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll vote for them until they give me a reason not to. The country is screwed and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the only hope.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez refuses to be drawn on what will happen on 23 July. But he notes that while all the polls suggest that Feij\u00c3\u00b3o will need Vox to govern, the polls also said the PP would need Vox to govern in Andaluc\u00c3\u00ada, where the conservatives ended up winning an absolute majority last year. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rule out Feij\u00c3\u00b3o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rise coming at the expense of Vox,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd he says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But how far will that go? What happens if Feij\u00c3\u00b3o gets an absolute majority? Then Vox would become a pretty small, irrelevant party.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd For now, he adds, the only certainty is that European politics as a whole is very fluid and changeable. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153When that [nationalism] wave came in Catalonia, Vox was a little boat, but if it hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t existed, it would never have been able to catch that wave,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says G\u00c3\u00b3nzalez. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153As long as Vox is around, it may be able to catch that wave, just like [Giorgia] Meloni [prime minister of Italy] caught it, or [Viktor] Orb\u00c3\u00a1n [prime minister of Hungary] caught it. These parties can grow a lot when there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a crisis.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/11/dilemma-for-uk-authors-as-russia-offers-huge-sums-for-escapist-fiction", "primaryCategory": "books", "title": "Dilemma for UK authors as Russia offers huge sums for escapist fiction", "lead": "Writers are receiving enticing bids for foreign rights to their books this spring, but many feel they cannot accept the money while the war continues", "author": "Vanessa Thorpe Arts and media correspondent", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T11:00:49Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764606", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/be72ed27b1dbc446e4a5a87c04a5207b1008ce33/0_290_5500_3300/500.jpg", "body": "The thirst for escapist literature in Russia has prompted a new bidding war for translated fiction. English-language authors of crime, romance and fantasy novels have received some unexpectedly enticing offers for their books this spring. But despite the increased price tag on these potential foreign rights deals, the war in Ukraine has led many British writers to resist the lure of Russian money. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We leave it up to our authors to see if they want to accept an offer,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Kate Nash, a leading British literary agent. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We see it as an individual decision. We have quite a few offers in from Russia at the moment and one publisher has just increased their bid to get the deal done.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Stories involving crime and romance, as well as historical sagas, sci-fi and fantasy, are at a premium, with the size of some Russian bids doubling. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Suddenly demand is strong, especially in the more escapist genres,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Nash, whose company represents a range of popular writers in a couple of the key genres. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The market was depressed after the pandemic and the start of the war, but it is definitely back now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd A British novelist who is not represented by Nash told the Observer she had just turned down a substantial rights offer, equivalent to several thousand pounds, on her newly published book, although the figure was higher than usual. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I would have felt like a hypocrite if I had accepted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the writer, whose popular books have historical settings. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hurl abuse at the TV every time there was news of another Russian atrocity, while turning a blind eye to the roubles \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcresting\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in my bank account. To be honest, I was also quite surprised this \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctrading\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was still going on at all. Of course, agents have to put offers to their writers, but it puts the writers in a difficult position if they need the cash. Far better not to be dealing with Russia at all under the circumstances.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Literary agents dealing with more commercial fiction report that Russian offers are generally up by a few thousand pounds, often reaching \u00c2\u00a35,000. This might not represent a fortune, but it is a valuable sum even for more successful authors, for whom living on the income generated by sales alone can be a struggle. When Russia invaded Ukraine last year several well-known writers, including Neil Gaiman and Stephen King, announced they would not agree to any Russian editions of their work for the duration of the conflict, while last April JK Rowling also withdrew online rights to the Harry Potter stories from Russia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s two largest ebook libraries. But other novelists have privately decided that allowing Russian readers continued access to foreign literature is important, as Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s government cracks down on freedom of expression. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is interesting who wants to do it and who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Laurence Laluyaux, who runs the international side of RCW, the long-established agency formerly known as Rogers, Coleridge and White. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Responses from agencies and from authors in the UK are mixed. Some agencies have a blanket rule not to do any Russian business. We do it author by author. We tell a writer whether the Russian publisher in question is supportive of Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s regime and then ask them how they feel.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The situation was complicated, Laluyaux added, because some Russian fiction editors had fled the country in order to carry on working freely. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Some of these editors and publishers in exile say that we are in danger of doing Putin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work for him if we do not trade with them. The result will be silence. So it is difficult. Certainly though, it is true that any money made from a book published there will go into the Russian economy.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The British author who turned down her own recent rights bid was sympathetic to both sides, she said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is important not to demonise authors who have been tempted. Most people don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realise how little the average author earns. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The fact that Russian publishing houses are making such substantial offers makes it hard for some to refuse. It also demonstrates how desperate the Russian book trade is to get its hands on western books.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The issue is a complex one for British literary festivals this summer. Laluyaux is aware of bans on Russian writers at many events, unless it is clear they are opposed to the war or at least living in exile. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The debate is happening everywhere. A lot of UK agencies have stopped dealing with Russian publishers or are almost not selling to them any more. We work directly with Russians, rather than through agencies, and so have a different relationship. We know which publishing houses are trying to operate in different ways or have relocated,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Laluyaux pointed out that new Russian propaganda laws had made it hard for native publishers to print anything involving LGBTQ lifestyles. Some publishers had left Russia in order to carry on printing an inclusive range of fiction, not just to criticise the regime. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to name them while they are setting these plans up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Russian demand for foreign-authored escapism was very strong, she added, but there was also a big appetite for self-help books and for historical works about fascist Germany."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/11/war-pony-review-vivid-account-of-daily-native-american-life", "primaryCategory": "film", "title": "War Pony review \u00e2\u20ac\u201c vivid account of daily Native American life", "lead": "Non-professional actors drive Gina Gammell and Riley Keough\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s award-winning first feature about growing up on a South Dakota reservation", "author": "Wendy Ide", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T11:00:49Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764608", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7543f39d73277750caf3bbfe6243cd854334f2cf/0_341_7193_4316/500.jpg", "body": "For boys of the Oglala Lakota tribe like 12-year-old Matho (LaDainian Crazy Thunder), and young men such as 23-year-old Bill (Jojo Bapteise Whiting), growing up on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota is a daily battle.

But in the aftermath of the Annecy attack some inevitably acted without restraint. Bystander footage of a man attacking children in a park in south-east France appeared online after the attack on Thursday and was still available, on Twitter and TikTok, on Friday. The distressing footage has been used by TV networks but is heavily edited. The raw versions seen by the Guardian show the attacker dodging a member of the public and running around the playground before appearing to stab a toddler in a pushchair. Twitter, as is now company policy under Elon Musk, did not respond to a request for comment, although of the two clips that the Guardian found on Friday, one had been taken down by Saturday and the other had been placed behind an age-restricted content warning screen. Both Twitter clips had a total of 50,000 views by Friday. In a social media world that has been largely self-regulated \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although that is now changing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you need to look at the content guidelines for guidance as to whether it should be up there. Twitter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sensitive media policy states people often use the platform to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153show what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happening in the world\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and this can include \u00e2\u20ac\u0153graphic content\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that, if you choose to share it, requires your account to be marked as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sensitive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which places content behind a warning screen. In the case of the Annecy clip, it appears to have been deemed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adult\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rather than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sensitive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd content. Either way, it was at least made more difficult to view and had either been reported to Twitter and acted upon, or caught by its moderation systems \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but not before tens of thousands of views. The TikTok video had been uploaded by a news account for Azteca, a Mexican broadcaster with 4.1 million followers. It showed the same unedited footage, including the stabbings, but was accompanied by a jarring soundtrack labelled as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Drama music suitable for battle scenes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. TikTok took down the video once it had been notified by the Guardian but not before it had been viewed more than 5m times. TikTok said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our teams have been responding to this tragic event by working rapidly to identify and remove violative content. We do not allow disturbing or extremely violent content on TikTok.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd TikTok\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guidelines state that the platform does not allow \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gory, gruesome, disturbing, or extremely violent content\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. There is a public interest exception for otherwise violative content that is deemed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153inform, inspire, or educate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c although the Annecy footage clearly does not qualify under that heading. Elsewhere, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, Meta, said any copies of the Annecy footage would be removed under its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dangerous organisations and individuals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd policy that bars content showing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153multiple-victim violence\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. YouTube has removed or age-restricted some bystander footage of the attack under policies that prohibit content intended to shock or disgust users. If tech platforms would cite this as an example of self-regulation working \u00e2\u20ac\u201c albeit, in the case of Twitter and TikTok, imperfectly \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is too late. In the UK, the online safety bill, due to become law this year, platforms face censure if they do not enforce their terms and conditions, which includes their guidelines on violent content. There is also a duty of care to shield children from harmful content, which could include the Annecy footage. Lorna Woods, a professor of internet law at the University of Essex, added that there was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153nothing to stop\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd platforms changing their terms of service and what sort of content they allowed. In the EU, the digital services act requires platforms to have measures in place to mitigate the risk of harmful content. Both acts carry the threat of substantial fines, and in extreme cases suspension, for breaches. Social media platforms are now in a world where, if their policies restrict unedited Annecy-style footage, they have to follow words with actions.

Luke took his own life on 22 April 2021 aged 40. It was only after his death that Annie looked at his phone and discovered he had been gambling in secret through the pandemic. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes it was over 12 hours\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 worth of gambling. He was betting over 100 times a day, just using his phone,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. A major inquest in Leicester on Wednesday will look at the role that gambling played in Luke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death and whether more could have been done to prevent it. Flutter, the parent company of Betfair where Annie says Luke did most of his betting, is officially included as an interested person. It is thought to be the first time a gambling company has been formally involved in an inquest, which will examine whether interventions by Betfair were adequate. Annie, 41, is haunted by how easy it was for Luke to gamble in secret on his mobile. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We used to watch our soaps together. I would not have thought for a second that having a phone in your hand is strange,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. Luke, who was on furlough from his job in a printing company, had a history of gambling problems but Annie thought he had stopped two years earlier. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gambling destroyed him from the inside,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It controlled him, it consumed him and then it destroyed him. It is so dangerous.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Luke had started betting on football at the weekend with friends, but Annie said the problem grew when a friend introduced him to exchange betting, where you bet on horses to lose as well as win. In summer 2019, he said he couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t afford a birthday present for her and that money was tight. It was only when she found a letter about a loan for many thousands of pounds that he finally admitted the extent of his betting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He said he absolutely hated gambling,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe how he had gambled so much. He was just trying to win back money to pay off the loans.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd When they cleared the debt and moved to a new house with their two children, Annie thought that chapter was over. Luke opted out of marketing from Betfair after 2017 but received a monthly \u00c2\u00a35 free bet available to all users. Annie has campaigned against free bet offers and called for the introduction of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Luke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to ban them. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it as being something that should happen, especially when we know people are losing their lives and the amount of damage gambling actually does to someone.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said Luke \u00e2\u20ac\u0153absolutely hated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd adverts for gambling and would get upset when they came on, as they made curbing his addiction more difficult. On 21 April 2021, Annie was in the classroom where she worked as a primary school teacher when her watch flashed up with a text from Luke. He was being sent to Scotland for delivery work and would be turning his phone off to save the battery. When he had not returned that evening she put it down to the long drive. But when there was no sign of him the next morning, she began to panic. She called the police and his boss, who said he had never sent him to Scotland and that Luke had told him his van was off the road. Eventually they were able to track his phone and ear buds to a flat in Yorkshire. When the police arrived they found him dead. The family\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lawyer, Merry Varney at Leigh Day, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gambling is something that people have had huge concerns about for a long period of time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and this only continues to grow. The inquest into Luke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death provides an opportunity for a full and fearless investigation into Annie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s allegation that gambling caused her husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death and an opportunity for lessons to be learned and future lives to be protected.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ian Brown, the chief executive of Flutter UK&amp;I, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We wish to reiterate our sincere condolences to Mrs Ashton and her family. We are truly sorry for their loss. Across Flutter UK&amp;I, we are absolutely committed to safe gambling and to protecting all our customers. We hold ourselves to the very highest standards in the industry. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are constantly learning and updating our processes and we have made many changes over the past three years to make gambling with our brands even safer. We will, of course, incorporate any additional learnings from this tragic case into our controls.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Annie met Luke on her first day at secondary school. He made her laugh so much that they got told off and she developed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a massive crush\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on him but through school they were just friends. Luke left to start work at 16 and she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hear from him again until they found each other on Facebook 10 years later. After their first date, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we never really spent a day apart from that day onwards\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She hopes the inquest will help give her some answers as to how the jovial man she fell in love with came to take his own life. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I just want Luke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice to be heard. I want them to know that he was just a normal person, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s happened to him, and more needs to be done to protect people that are suffering.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

What could have been a luridly camp romp from first-time writer-director Thomas Hardiman descends into listless speculation and clumsily manufactured intrigue. Some, but not all of the film\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shortcomings can be blamed on the decision to shoot the whole picture in a single continuous take. When the pace flags \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it frequently does \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the film-makers are unable to inject a burst of energy through the editing. Mainly, though, the problem lies with a screenplay that fails to create suspense, or even to persuade us to care who killed a brilliant but unpopular hair stylist.

Her recently completed leather-working workshops for Herm\u00c3\u00a8s, in Normandy, are a composition of variously shaped brick arches set to a rhythm inspired by galloping horses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a Roman aqueduct with the nervous energy of a stable of thoroughbreds. Her debut project, designed in a multinational partnership with the Italian-Israeli architect Dan Dorell and the Japanese Tsuyoshi Tane, was the Estonian National Museum, a statement of pride, optimism and defiance built on a former Soviet airfield. Most impactful is the Stone Garden in Beirut, a 13-storey block of flats on which design and construction work started before her partnership with Dorell and Tane broke up, and completed after she set up on her own account in 2016. It combines textured concrete and deep-set windows with sharp angles and emphatic cantilevers to create something earthy and engineered at once, ancient and contemporary, daring but robust. In 2020 its metaphorical resilience was put to the test in an all-too-literal way, when a huge amount of ammonium nitrate on the MV Rhosus blew up in the nearby Port of Beirut. The Stone Garden was damaged, but survived. Her Serpentine Pavilion, the latest edition of the annual temporary structures that have been going up outside the Serpentine Gallery in London since 2000, is by contrast light and low. It is a nine-sided parasol in pleated timber, as skinny as can be, scalloped around its outer edges, supported on a double ring of narrow wooden pillars. One of its aims is sustainability \u00e2\u20ac\u201c to use low-emissions materials, to minimise foundations, to avoid waste in construction. It is designed to be easily demounted and reassembled, as like all Serpentine Pavilions the plan is to sell it to a collector after its nearly five-month stay in Kensington Gardens. Another aim is intimacy. Ghotmeh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pavilion, which she has named \u00c3\u20ac table, is, according to the official blurb, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153French call to sit down together at the table to share a meal and enter into dialogue\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It is, she tells me, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153about getting together to think about our relationships to one another and to nature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. She also cites her experiences of living in Beirut \u00e2\u20ac\u201c witnessing the destruction of civil war from the seventh-floor apartment in which she grew up, seeing trees and plants \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coming through despite the ruins\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that gave her the desire both \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to bring beauty back to the city\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to live in synergy with nature\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Ghotmeh (b.1980) describes Lebanon as chronically misgoverned and divided, somewhere where you \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel that the country can never heal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So she wants to make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153place of assembly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where people might \u00e2\u20ac\u0153find a common future\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Inspirations for the project include togunas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c structures for community gatherings in Mali, whose low ceilings encourage people to sit rather than stand. An important part of her design is an arrangement of specially designed tables and stools (versions of which will be available to buy at the Conran Shop) in a big ring under the spreading roof. She does indeed achieve a structure that sits lightly on the ground, a convivial shelter with a pleasingly intricate ceiling and also-pleasing fine edges to its roof, a place of shade among the mature trees of its location. Its relatively rare nonagonal geometry (octagons are more common in architecture), whereby opposite sides of the shape are different from each other, makes the space subtly dynamic. The ubiquitous use of timber does, as she intends, enhance the feeling of contact with nature. There are also things that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work, most conspicuously plywood screens with leaf-like patterns cut in them by what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s called computer numerical control, or CNC. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a cheap and lifeless technique, the stuff of online garden furniture catalogues \u00e2\u20ac\u201c used presumably for cost reasons instead of the special low-carbon glass that was promised when the designs were first unveiled \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that manages to make the pavilion look less floaty than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d hope. Ghotmeh, when I ask her about these screens, seems to wince. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also unclear that the great collective dining experience of which she talks will really happen. Cafe food will be supplied by Benugo, with menu ideas contributed by Ghotmeh, but this informal browsing is not the same as the grand coming-together implied by the big ring of table. There may be a disconnect here between the symbolic ambitions of the architecture and its lived reality. Ghotmeh is a remarkable architect, but this is a not-quite-remarkable building, for reasons inherent in the Serpentine\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commission. Part of what makes architecture special is the way it is wrought, but the conditions of the pavilion\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s construction \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at speed, at some scale, under pressure \u00e2\u20ac\u201c make its details prey to the exigencies of project management. At the same time, every Serpentine Pavilion has to carry a heavy load of public relations and cultural expectation. Its premise is that this is world-class architecture, worthy of sponsorship by Goldman Sachs, attractive to wealthy collectors, with meaningful things to say about nature and humanity. It assumes that architecture can be traded like art, and espouses the now old-fashioned idea that the imprint of a celebrated architect (once called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153iconic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) is the most crucial ingredient in creating a great building. So the appearance of brilliance is demanded, even as the constructional means to achieve it are limited. If Ghotmeh\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building were permanent and useful \u00e2\u20ac\u201c let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say as a cafe or restaurant; if its details were less compromised, and if there were less glare of expectation, it would be rightly celebrated as a delightful place to eat and meet. All that said, and for all that the Serpentine Pavilion seems like an idea perennially near its expiry date, it does keep giving glimpses of the possibilities of architecture. The best thing that the gallery could now do would be to confront the contradictions of their concept, look at the processes by which their pavilions come into being, and work out how they genuinely can achieve joy and beauty. The Serpentine Pavilion, London, is open until 29 October"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/11/pride-celebration-us-trans-gay-rights", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThe hate never went away\u00e2\u20ac\u2122: US schools face violent Pride backlash", "lead": "The decision to observe Pride did not spark street brawls last year.

Police in riot gear. Barricades on the street and helicopters overhead. This was the scene outside a suburban California school board meeting this week, as the board planned to vote on whether the district should officially recognize June as LGBTQ+ pride month. A year ago, the decision to observe Pride at schools in Glendale, a suburb about 20 minutes from downtown Los Angeles, did not spark street brawls or result in multiple arrests. But this year things were different. Maebe Pudlo, a trans nonbinary activist and drag queen who has run for US congress in the district, was among those who showed up to the Glendale unified school district\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s meeting. She says local advocates supporting Pride were greeted by people calling them \u00e2\u20ac\u0153groomers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pedophiles\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and were accused of trying to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153indoctrinate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd children. Footage of the violent demonstration in Glendale showed groups of men in the streets in identical \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Leave our kids alone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd T-shirts and crowds of people shoving and punching each other. The Glendale police said their attempts to de-escalate the situation failed, even after arresting three people and they declared an unlawful assembly and ordered the crowd outside the school to disperse. Though the board ultimately voted to recognize Pride month, as they have done since 2019, the experience was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153terrifying\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Pudlo, who said she has faced a wave of online harassment since. Anonymous accounts are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153saying that folk like me should be killed and hanged\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she said. California \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is supposed to be a safe state\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Local journalists and advocates said that multiple rightwing activists with a history of violence were present at the Glendale incident. The unrest came less than a week after protesters and police clashed outside a North Hollywood elementary school during a demonstration over a planned Pride assembly. There, too, protesters were seen wearing T-shirts reading \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Leave our kids alone,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and a trailer with a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153leave our kids alone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd banner drove through the streets. The rhetoric at the protest was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ugly\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hateful\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Reverand Pat Langlois, who attended the North Hollywood demonstration in support of LGBTQ+ families. While she has been to many protests in the past four decades, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This was something different,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd she said. A transgender teacher\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pride flag was previously set on fire at the same school, prompting a police investigation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We think of these things happening in the deep south, or in some very conservative rural areas. This happened a few minutes away from one of the epicenters of gay liberation,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Roland Palencia, a co-founder of Gay and Lesbian Latinos Unidos, and a longtime activist in Los Angeles. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our allies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they need to speak out,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Palencia added. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This is the time when they need to say, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEnough is enough.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On 6 June, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), an advocacy group, announced that it was declaring a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153state of emergency\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for LGBTQ+ people in America, hoping to galvanize politicians and other allies to take more action to defend queer people amidst an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153unprecedented and dangerous spike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in legislative assaults, as well as literal ones. So far this year, HRC has documented nearly 20 different acts of intimidation targeting Pride and drag events across the US, from violent protests to bomb threats to extremists showing up to children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s drag story hours. More than 500 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced across the country, with at least 76 signed into law as of early June \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the most of any year on record \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and more than twice the number of anti-LGBTQ+ laws passed last year, the organization said. The majority of these bills target trans people, especially trans youth, with a focus on laws \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that make it impossible for transgender minors to be able to access medically necessary, best-practice gender-affirming care\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, said Sarah Warbelow, HRC\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vice- president of legal policy. Some of these anti-trans laws target healthcare workers, attempting to criminalise them if they try to provide gender-affirming care, and many \u00e2\u20ac\u0153are going after the parents of transgender children, as well\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she said. There has also been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153an incredible uptick\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in bills \u00e2\u20ac\u0153that would make it impossible for school personnel to support LGBTQ+ youth in classroom\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, she added, from Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say gay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd law, to attempts to force schools to out students to their parents in the name of parental rights. Under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say gay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd laws in public schools, many teachers \u00e2\u20ac\u0153feel that they can no longer be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity and they have to hide who they are out of fear that a parent will single them out, target them, sue their school\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, Warbelow said. Because of federal civil rights protections, teachers might ultimately win those lawsuits, but that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t matter, Warbelow said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Many folks feel like they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a meaningful choice, even if the law technically protects them.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Just three years ago, a surging QAnon conspiracy theory movement claimed that Democrats and other elite figures were torturing and violating children as part of satanic rituals, lurid allegations that helped galvanize the January 6 attack on the US capitol. Now, those same kind of political \u00e2\u20ac\u0153conspiracies\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd are being applied to LGBTQ+ people, Bamby Salcedo, the president of the TransLatin@ Coalition in Los Angeles, noted. As cities across the country roll out Pride parades, marches and parties, meant to commemorate the June 1969 uprising against police violence at the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan, many people are on edge, worried about increased harassment or being the targets of deadly attacks. During Pride month in June 2016, a gunman opened fire at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, leaving 49 people dead in what is still one of the deadliest mass shootings in US history. Last November, Club Q, an LGBTQ+ bar in Colorado, which was hosting a drag event, was the target of another deadly shooting which left five people dead and 17 wounded. Despite the political atmosphere, many LGBTQ+ Americans say that, while they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re paying more attention to their safety in public, they do not want to give up on Pride events. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We need to be reminded that we are beautiful and resilient people,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Salcedo, the president of the TransLatin@ Coalition, said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are not going to let all this negativity take us away from celebrating ourselves and letting the world know that we exist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd After decades of advances, including winning the legality for same sex marriage, many LGBTQ+ Americans, especially those in more Democratic states, had come to think of their fight for equality as a linear and unbroken march of progress, Palencia said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re realizing is that there are going to be more twists and turns for us to get to full recognition as citizens and as human beings,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Palencia said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The reality is that the hate never went away.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/11/ron-desantis-trump-republican-2024", "primaryCategory": "us-news", "title": "Republican red meat: Ron DeSantis bids to outflank Trump on the right", "lead": "From Covid to crime, from immigration to cultural issues, the Florida governor is aiming to paint Trump as too liberal", "author": "David Smith in Washington", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T10:00:48Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764626", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/5907825b4707fe6757e785aec07611aae00054e2/0_63_4248_2549/500.jpg", "body": "Donald Trump is not the most rightwing candidate running for the White House. That is a statement few would have thought possible after the former president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brand of nativist-populism reshaped the Republican party. But as the Republican primary election for 2024 gathers pace, Trump finds himself eclipsed on the right by Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who is betting that the party\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voters are spoiling for an even more extreme agenda. From Covid to crime, from immigration to cultural issues, DeSantis is staking out territory that leaves the 76-year-old frontrunner fending off a once unthinkable criticism: he might be a bit too liberal. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DeSantis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strategy for now is that he is going to try to outflank Trump to the right and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s opportunity there,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He can go after Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s record as president on spending. He can go after Trump on refusing to address entitlement reform, which Republicans seemed to abandon writ large.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This week, Trump was indicted on charges of mishandling classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. DeSantis did not attempt to capitalise but rather condemned the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153weaponization of federal law enforcement\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He has been dubbed a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153mini-Trump\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd who seeks to emulate the former president. But in his first 10 days on the campaign trail, DeSantis has assailed Trump from the right. He told a conservative radio host \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this is a different guy than 2015, 2016,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before deriding bipartisan criminal justice reform legislation that Trump championed as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153basically a jailbreak bill\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd letting dangerous people out of prison. On immigration, DeSantis has played to the base by flying migrants from Florida to Massachusetts and California while arguing that Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u0153endorsed and tried to ram\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amnesty\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bill through Congress. The governor even claimed Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature issue for himself by asserting that he would finish building a wall on the US-Mexico border. DeSantis can point to a hard-right record in Florida and suggest that he gets the job done in contrast to Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unfulfilled promises at the White House. He has accused Trump of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153turning the reins over\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to Anthony Fauci, America\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top infectious disease expert, during the Covid pandemic while he says he kept Florida open for business. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We chose freedom over Faucism,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DeSantis told voters last week. Whalen, who served as a speechwriter for the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What DeSantis is going to attack him on is that Donald Trump turned loose Anthony Fauci. Trump at no point fired anybody. Trump let Fauci drive children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s healthcare policy. If Trump wants to engage with this on a conversation over who handled Covid better, boy, if I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Ron DeSantis, bring it on.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Extraordinarily, Trump finds himself on the defensive over what many neutral observers and critics regard as one his few positive achievements: the development of coronavirus vaccines in less than a year. Campaigning in Grimes, Iowa, he received a pointed question from a woman who claimed that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we have lost people because you supported the jab,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd a reference to conspiracy theories about mRNA vaccines, which have been credited with saving millions of lives. While Trump did not dismiss her suggestion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and stressed that he was never in favour of mandates \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he explained that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a big portion of the country that thinks that was a great thing, you understand that. Not a lot of the people in this room, but there is a big portion.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DeSantis has also taken a swipe at Trump for saying he did not like the term \u00e2\u20ac\u0153woke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because people struggle to define it. The governor retorted: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Woke is an existential threat to our society. To say it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a big deal, that just shows you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand what a lot of these issues are right now.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The skirmishes imply that DeSantis and Trump are running separate races. While the governor is aiming to woo Republican primary voters who have spent years embracing extremism, Trump is already looking ahead to a general election against Joe Biden where moderate swing state voters are critical. Trump has repeatedly hit DeSantis from the left, arguing that his votes to cut social security and Medicare in Congress will make him unelectable in a general election \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed budgets also repeatedly called for major entitlement cuts. Although Trump is quick to remind voters that he appointed three supreme court justices who, last year, helped end the constitutional right to abortion, he has also suggested that Florida\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new six-week abortion ban is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153too harsh\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. In a Fox News town hall with Sean Hannity, he urged pragmatism with an eye on the general election: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I happen to be of the Ronald Reagan school in terms of exemptions, where you have the life of the mother, rape and incest. For me, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s something that works very well and for probably 80, 85%, because don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forget, we do have to win elections.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Tara Setmayer, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s current campaign strategists know that abortion is a huge weakness for the Republicans on a national stage going into 2024, evidenced by what happened in the midterms with the issue of abortion. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trump is trying to thread the needle and sound more pragmatic on that because he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually thinking about the general at this point for that specific issue. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good chunk of Republican voters who are not happy with the extreme abortion bans that are being pushed by the party.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd DeSantis\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s even-harder right approach could backfire in a national race against Biden, according to Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a risky proposition by the DeSantis camp to try to run to the right of Trump at this point because it feels as though it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a very myopic strategy to just get out of the primary. Given how extreme his policies have been in Florida and what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advocated for, if by some miracle he did defeat Trump in the primaries, how does he walk all of that back to appeal to a general election electorate in this country? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This idea that he wants to scale up Florida is anathema to what the majority of the American people across the country actually want policy-wise. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not out of the ordinary that candidates tack more to the middle once they get into a general but we have never seen this level of extreme policy positions in a primary translate to a general election and be successful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump is not willing to be entirely out-Trumped. He has pushed the death penalty for drug dealers and renewed his pledge to use the US military to attack foreign drug cartels. He also revived his pledge to end birthright citizenship, saying he would sign an executive order on the first day of his second term to change the long-settled interpretation of the 14th amendment. The posturing from both men might come to nought. History suggests that policy can be less important to voters than personality. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DeSantis is running to the right of Trump on policy. The particular niche of Trump is that his rhetoric and his populism remains further right than DeSantis. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DeSantis has been a governor, a member of Congress. For all of his rhetorical policy stances and the policies he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signed into law, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still part of the government. Sure, Trump was president, but he has carved a place for himself as a demagogue, as someone who is running both for and against the political and economic system in America.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Jacobs added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153DeSantis would like him to run on policy and then DeSantis can run on his record of what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s accomplished and try to win over Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rightwing base. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think Trump is going to let him do that. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s going to continue to mock and portray DeSantis as part of the problem, someone who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feeble and lacks the grit and the guts of a strong leader.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Trump allies dismiss DeSantis as an imitator who rings hollow. Roger Stone, a political consultant and self-proclaimed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dirty trickster\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd based in Florida, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153He can try to sound like Trump, he can try to position himself like Trump, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think those are his real politics. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an establishment Republican.

My deadline crept closer, but I did not want to click the button, I did not want, actually, to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153find my doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Perhaps I could write around it, I suggested, weakly. I went to lunch; I kept my eyes on the pavement for fear of catching my own eye. The subject of doppelg\u00c3\u00a4ngers swims regularly in and out of popular culture, mirroring, revealing, bringing varying degrees of discomfort. Naomi Klein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new book grapples with the idea of a doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger after the writer and academic realised she was regularly mistaken for Naomi Wolf. On Twitter, recently, she asked her followers if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d ever encountered their own lookalike and the replies were filled with familiarly gripping stories, including a comedian who\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been on stage when, as a whole, the audience and he started to become aware of his lookalike sitting in an early row \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the two went on to perform the set as a double act. Every few months there is a tabloid piece featuring similar stories, illustrated with photos of two people laughing side by side, amazed to have met their twin on a plane, or at a wedding \u00e2\u20ac\u201c these are framed as beautiful coincidences, we meet the subjects when the shock is fresh and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re grinning with wonder. Deborah Levy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s new novel explores the same theme \u00e2\u20ac\u201c travelling through Europe, a pianist called Elsa comes across her double. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My startling thought at that moment was that she and I were the same person,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Elsa says. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153She was me and I was her. Perhaps she was a little more me than I was.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Those stories relied on coincidence, a sort of supernatural chance, which one can bypass now, if they choose, by downloading an app. But before this long list of lookalike apps existed, before Google Lens allowed a person to upload a selfie then click to find every other stranger on earth that shared their features, seeing your doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger (the word translates from German as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double walker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) was considered a bad omen. The very worst omen, in fact. According to both English and German folklore, it meant death would follow. I tried talking to my editor again: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just trying to write a fun piece, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not ready to die.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The feeling of seeing doubles in those tabloid stories is similar to a kind of seasickness. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the differences that destabilise you \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the same but different variations of nostril and ear, which cause that familiar psychic wobble. You feel it when looking at the work of Canadian artist Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Brunelle, who was inspired to find and photograph more than 200 pairs of unrelated doppelg\u00c3\u00a4ngers after being taken aback, he said, by how similar he looked to Rowan Atkinson. The picture series, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m Not a Look-alike!, which took 12 years to put together, features men and women who stare out of the frame with the same round gazes, the same low brows (as seen on the previous page). When the project went viral, it was brought to the attention of Dr Manel Esteller, a researcher at the Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute in Barcelona, who recruited 32 pairs of Brunelle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look-alikes to take DNA tests and complete questionnaires about their lives. What was the explanation for these doppelg\u00c3\u00a4ngers, he wondered? What were we seeing? He found that the 16 pairs who were \u00e2\u20ac\u0153true\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lookalikes, according to facial-recognition software, shared significantly more genes than the others that the software deemed less similar. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Now there are so many people in the world,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Dr Esteller explained to the New York Times, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the system is repeating itself.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Not only are apps that can find our doppelg\u00c3\u00a4ngers multiplying, the population is multiplying, too, at a pace which means we are all more likely to have one. I just\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to meet her. To be fair, I should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve known what I was getting into when I started writing. One reason I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been led here, to this piece, and this list of apps and the blankest selfie I could muster, was a series of news stories about people tracking down their doppelg\u00c3\u00a4ngers with malicious intent. When the body of a young woman was found last August in a parked car in Germany, her family identified her as Sharaban K, 23, a Munich-based beautician with Iraqi roots. But after the postmortem, questions were raised. The victim was eventually named as Khadidja O, an Algerian beauty blogger \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the two looked (said police) \u00e2\u20ac\u0153strikingly alike\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. They discovered that several similar looking women had been contacted on social media by Sharaban K in the week before Khadidja\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s death \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in January she was arrested. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Investigations have led us to assume that the accused wanted to go into hiding because of a family dispute and fake her own death to that effect,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said the state prosecutor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a case like this every day, especially with such a spectacular twist.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Then April came, and a woman, 47, was sentenced for stealing the identity of her American lookalike, who she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d poisoned with a tranquilliser-laced cheesecake. In August 2016, Russian-born Viktoria Nasyrova had visited the New York home of Olga Tsvyk, 35, carrying a cake. The women looked strikingly similar with the same hair and complexion, and both spoke Russian. The next day a friend found Tsvyk unconscious, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153dressed in lingerie with pills scattered around her body as if the woman had attempted to kill herself\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When she got home from the hospital she found her passport and papers were missing; in court this year, Nasyrova shouted \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fuck you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the Queens Supreme Court judge as he sent her to prison for 21 years. An earlier doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger case saw a man called Richard A Jones convicted of aggravated robbery after being picked out of a lineup and serving 17 years in prison, despite maintaining his innocence. But in 2018, after witnesses were shown side-by-side photographs of him and another suspect (a stranger to Jones), and couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell them apart, a judge threw out his conviction. So, yes, that German state prosecutor was right, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a case like this every day, but also, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not? Teghan Lucas, an anatomist who specialises in forensic anthropology, had by chance researched the possibility of a case like Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s three years earlier. She analysed the faces of almost 4,000 people, measuring the distances between features, such as their eyes and ears, and calculating the probability that two people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s faces would match. She found the chances of sharing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153eight dimensions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd with someone else are less than one in a trillion. With 7.4 billion people on the planet, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a one in 135 chance there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a single pair of doppelg\u00c3\u00a4ngers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extremely unlikely,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Lucas told the BBC. But, as Jones\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s case later proved, this analysis had a flaw \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it relied on computers rather than the odd unpredictability of the human eye, the ways we respond to a face, or a movement. When we say we recognise someone, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not just revealing something about them, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re revealing something about ourselves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our recognition abilities, and what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve learned about how a face might age, the slipperiness of a smile, what we see when we see a stranger. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a subject that interests Anouchka Grose, a psychoanalyst who, a few years ago, found strangers started treating her differently, a mixture of awe and familiarity. She was unnerved, until someone explained they were mistaking her for an actor in Hollyoaks who looked remarkably similar. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not an uncommon experience, Grose says. She likens it to falling upon a reflection of yourself in a window or unexpected mirror, and taking a moment before realising that person is you. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maybe you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re instantly repelled, or feel oddly drawn to this weird you-like person. Seeing yourself as if from the outside is something like seeing a ghost, or being undead.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd It makes you wonder, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What if the other you was more real than you? Or better at it?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I ask her why this is a subject that remains so fascinating to us. Well, she says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Freud thinks the doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger is uncanny, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unconsciously linked to the idea of one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own death. The soul is the original \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdouble\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Human narcissism is such that we long for immortality and so the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimmortal soul\u00e2\u20ac\u2122,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like the portrait in oil, or the family photograph, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153promises to keep us in the world forever. The world without us is just too unthinkable. But that wish or fantasy becomes repressed and so the double becomes uncanny \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the thing we were using to defend ourselves against the idea of our own death becomes the thing that reminds us of it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Death \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there it is again. Why does every road from the doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger lead back to the earth? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Seeing someone just like you can make you feel totally displaced. While part of you might want to take on the world together, another part of you might think, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the point in me any more?\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 I guess envy and rivalry are the big risks with doppelg\u00c3\u00a4ngers. What if they stole your job, your friends, your partner? Or \u00e2\u20ac\u201c what if they felt as displaced by you as you do by them?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Grose adds, quite brightly, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The only way out would be a fight to the death.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd While that idea \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that a person must die after seeing their doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger \u00e2\u20ac\u201c seems archaic and grounded in the ghostly, like most myths it describes something very real. Later, Grose emails me a warning: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Stay off those apps!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Still stalling, I sent my editor a history of doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger sightings believed to have ended in death. She was tiring of me now. The best-known stories include Catherine the Great\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s servants seeing her double sitting on her throne while she was asleep. The empress ordered the impostor to be shot; Catherine died of a stroke a few weeks later. A hundred years after that, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley told his wife, Mary Shelley, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d seen his double. He reported a number of sightings, the last occurring on a terrace in Italy in June 1822, where his doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger asked if he would \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ever be content\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. A few days later, Shelley\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s boat capsized, and he died. My editor replied promptly with a link to an explanation: psychologists have identified neurological conditions in which one hallucinates their own image at a distance. It follows, then, that somebody with a brain tumour which was causing hallucinations, hallucinations which include seeing their double, might die shortly after. Fine, I responded, grimly. My selfie glared at me. My deadline tutted. I clicked the button. In the past, it would have taken a lifetime of travel and remarkable luck to bump into your doppelg\u00c3\u00a4nger. Today, apparently, it takes a basic smartphone. The lists of apps are named things like Twin Stranger and I Look Like You, and they claim to match your face to that of its users, or its nearest celebrity, or a long-dead person in a painting. There are functions on social media sites which do similar, like Pinterest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Visually Similar Results search, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Google Lens, which scans the whole internet. As I scrolled through the options, I got a brief understanding of the impulse of a person like Viktoria Nasyrova. What if there was a way, a simple way, to slip unseen into a stranger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s life, and move about in their shoes without anybody noticing? Historically, meeting a lookalike would have happened rarely and by accident, but today an industry has formed that offers to search the world for yours while you wait, scrolling in bed. It reminded me of the search for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the one\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the search for a soulmate, now also shifted online after years relying on random encounters. The search for someone who will understand us. Connection. In the half second it takes for Google to swoop through its many millions of images, my screen filled with faces. But, having scrubbed the internet for my lookalike, it presented me, not with a nice 45-year-old in Hungary or distant sister in Hull, but instead the cropped \u00e2\u20ac\u0153before and after\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd faces advertised by plastic surgery websites. And honestly, I have no illusions that the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153after\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd face was my lookalike. Was this what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been worried about? Being confronted with my flaws? With what I really looked like, outside the mirror? I tried again, a different photo, and got a woman selling earrings in Poland. I realised what the app was seeing was basically: white woman with nose. The mystique had truly been lost. The poetry, gone. I was reluctant to try the celebrity lookalike sites, because what it means to look like a celebrity is to look like a vastly less attractive version of them. Nonetheless, I uploaded my photo and kept clicking until I got Cher. Then, after many false starts, their shonky website creaking under the weight of me, Twinstrangers presented me with 856 results \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the majority were simply cheery girls with red hair. But \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there was one, a woman with dark eyebrows and a combative stare, who the site said was an 86% match. I saw something of myself in her. It made me pause, for a second at least. What did it mean to see a person who looked like me? What did it mean, to see a glimpse of myself living happily in Armenia? And to know that it was likely there were other strangers who look even more similar? To know I could be one of hundreds, with the same grim smile, the same pointy chin? I have pencilled in a funeral for July."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/jun/11/paintings-from-mark-gatiss-and-john-lithgow-among-exhibition-of-actors-art", "primaryCategory": "artanddesign", "title": "Paintings from Mark Gatiss and John Lithgow among exhibition of actors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 art", "lead": "Stars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 paintings go in show in London next month, with proceeds going to struggling actors", "author": "Richard Brooks", "datePublished": "2023-06-11T10:00:48Z", "dateScraped": "2023-06-12 10:51:44.764630", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "GuardianInt", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/02e3e810a052c99693c098bbe5efc2c8d2bed326/0_302_4032_2419/500.jpg", "body": "By night, Mark Gatiss is portraying Sir John Gielgud at the National Theatre.

Having made a documentary for television on the 1950s painter, John Minton, five years ago, he was inspired to start art classes during Covid in 2021. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Drawing and painting are both relaxing and stimulating,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Gatiss told the Observer. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know of any other activity where I lose myself so completely.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Now, along with more than 20 leading British thespians, he is contributing to an exhibition of actors\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 works next month.

Carroll attended art and drama schools before concentrating on acting. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I love its collaborative process. But I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always done art as a hobby, and, in my early days as an actor, for extra income too. I find art meditative, and a great balance for acting as it slows you down. Actors are also observers and creative, so that helps with art.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Carroll agrees that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in acting we have no control. With art, you have much more.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Included in the exhibition as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153honorary Brit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is American-born John Lithgow, winner of six Emmys for shows such as 3rd Rock from the Sun. He is showing three portraits, including one of Winston Churchill, whom he played in The Crown, while Fenella Woolgar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s portraits of Richard E Grant and Tanya Moodie will also be displayed. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m addicted to portraiture and character,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Woolgar, known for Call The Midwife. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Richard was extremely stoic and sat on a chair and a pile of books for two days.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd James Fleet, from Four Weddings and a Funeral and The Vicar of Dibley, is offering his Danny Sapani, the British actor from Black Panther. Not all are painters. Nicholas Farrell, who made his name in Chariots of Fire, does lino cuts, often of ducks. Ex-Emmerdale actor Sian Reese-Williams and Anastasia Hille, Gertrude in the Benedict Cumberbatch Hamlet at the Barbican in 2015, have pottery in the show. There will also be bird photography by Sam West \u00e2\u20ac\u201c noted for many stage and screen roles, and currently shooting the next TV series of All Creatures Great and Small. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as some photographers do \u00e2\u20ac\u201c as hunting or capturing,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says West, now a Royal Society for the Protection of Birds ambassador. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s quite a divide, too, between those who watch birds and those who take pictures.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd West, son of Timothy West and Prunella Scales, took up photography as a child. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But I was never good enough to consider it a career. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve a decent eye for composition, which is useful as I occasionally direct.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd West will also provide a drawing, owned by his parents, by the Hollywood star and talented artist Tony Curtis. It is one of a very few (another is a painting by No\u00c3\u00abl Coward of a port in Jamaica where he lived) which are not for sale. Most works \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which include one by the late Antony Sher being donated by his husband, Greg Doran \u00e2\u20ac\u201c are priced in the hundreds of pounds or low thousands. Many actors will try to be at the exhibition to talk about their work, with one day planned for schoolchildren. The proceeds will go to the Theatre Artists Fund, set up in 2020 by Sam Mendes, initially to help actors during Covid, but now aiding those struggling or out of work."}]
