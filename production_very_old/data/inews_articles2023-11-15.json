('Fast Car' did not go unrecognised in its time, though: it won a Grammy for Best Female Vocal Performance and received two further Grammy nominations.)

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Though it has been recognised at the Country awards, 'Fast Car' transcends genre. Millions of listeners worldwide will recognise its opening notes: a hopeful melody played on plucked acoustic guitar, shortly followed by Chapman's distinctive deep voice ('You got a fast car/And I want a ticket to anywhere') and accompanied by a quiet, shuffling beat. There's a big, almost pop-rock style chorus with added instrumental depth, and all the hallmarks of classic narrative songwriting that means the track doesn't immediately slot into one category. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Its themes, too, are universally appealing. It's about getting out of poverty, escaping your circumstances, dreaming big. Chapman wrote the song when she was in her early twenties, and many listeners, including me, discovered it around adolescence or early adulthood. 'I, I had a feeling that I belonged/I, I had a feeling I could be someone' – is there a lyric that better encapsulates longing hopefulness, the feeling of leaving home for the first time, of embarking on a big trip, or simply of sitting in your bedroom striving for more?  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Though it remains acoustic throughout, the song has a big build, so you feel you're on the journey with her. The propulsive feel is exacerbated by the rhythm of the lines: in the verse, the rhythm gets quicker towards the end of each line (consider the contrast between the rhythm of 'fast car' and 'ticket to anywhere'). This device continues in the chorus when the sped-up rhythm is maintained: 'City lights lay out before us/ And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulders' – this, of course, leads to the climax: the 'I, I' cry that everyone can sing along to. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Chapman is known for staying out the spotlight – nobody was surprised by her non-attendance at last night's awards – and she is also known for her selective licensing of her songs (in 2018, for example, she sued Nicki Minaj over an unlicensed sample of her 1988 song 'Baby Can I Hold You', permission for which Chapman alleged had repeatedly denied – the case was settled for $450k). When her music is used beyond the bounds of purist listening or performance contexts, then, you know it's really special. 'Fast Car' was licensed, for example, in the finale of Lena Dunham's Girls – as Marnie and Hannah drive away from New York to Hannah's new house upstate, 'Fast Car' comes on the car stereo and Marnie begins to sing along theatrically. Rumour has it that Dunham personally called Chapman to ask her to use the song. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "'Fast Car' has been covered several times, though. In 2015 it got a tropical house remix by the Swedish producer Tobtok, and another pop-house interpretation by Jonas Blue that year. The song has had many more live interpretations, including from the likes of Sam Smith and Justin Bieber, and countless covers by aspiring singers online. When Combs released his version in August this year, it became an instant hit, reaching number two on the Billboard 100 (higher than Chapman's original at the time), and blew up on TikTok. Save for their very different voices, and the higher production quality of 2023 studios, Combs's version remains quite faithful to the original, with acoustic guitar and sparing sound effects. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "But with such a classic, it needn't have taken a cover to be revived: 'Fast Car' sits alongside the likes of Kate Bush's 'Running Up That Hill' and Fleetwood Mac's 'Dreams' in the category of songs that – as TikTok proves – transcend generations. Though this will always be her most popular song, Chapman is an artist who should be celebrated for her wider body of work, which is often spiky and political (Chapman is also heavily involved in charity work).  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "The award win for Combs's cover is controversial: writing in the Washington Post, Emily Yahr argued that the accolade was 'clouded by the fact that, as a Black queer woman, Chapman, 59, would have almost zero chance of that achievement herself in country music'. We can only hope that the more people hear 'Fast Car', the more recognition she will get – and the more new life can be given to its immortal lines.

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Two films were made about Diana before her death – both in the 90s at peak Diana hysteria. First there was 1993's three-hour TV biopic Diana: Her True Story, based on Andrew Morton's 1992 biography of the same name, and the 1996 film Princess in Love, based on the 1994 book by Anna Pasternak, which told the story of Diana's infamous five-year affair with her riding instructor, James Hewitt. Both these films (and their corresponding books) came out just after Diana separated from Prince Charles in 1992, but before the divorce was finalised. It was during these years that Diana began to be viewed as a tragic figure, and romantic heroine. Kind, beautiful, charismatic – and sidelined by a cheating husband, languishing in palaces. In other words, the perfect female lead. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "In Her True Story Diana was played by Serena Scott Thomas, and, like the book, the film was controversial for not flinching from the intense depression Diana experienced in the marriage. Though Scott Thomas wasn't far off in looks, firmly fringed and thickly mascara-ed, only sometimes did she capture Diana's manner and syntax; likewise, the rest of the cast – David Threlfall as Charles and Anne Stallybrass as Queen Elizabeth – appeared more focused on dramatising the story than fully channelling the characters. That said, next to Princess in Love, Her True Story might as well have been a documentary. In the latter film they barely bothered to make Julie Cox have even a passing resemblance to Diana, dressing her in dowdy jumpers and pearls and blowing out her hair. The book was based almost entirely on information given to Pasternak by Hewitt, whereas Morton used information sourced directly from Diana. Wherever they came from – the press, of course, played a major role too – a whole host of Dianas were proliferating across the public consciousness.  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "When she died in 1997, they would only continue to multiply. In a 2017 essay for The Guardian, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Diana's death, Hilary Mantel wrote that 'she no longer exists as herself, only as what we made of her' – this could almost have been true in 1996. But her death, a year after her divorce was finalised, meant such mythology could run wild: there was no new information, only existing narratives that fed off themselves. She had been cast as the antithesis of Charles, who was not only bitter, buttoned-up and in love with someone else, but 13 years her senior – next to him, she was a picture of youthful naivety. This juxtaposition meant that the sense of her as an endlessly generous person didn't reflect well on him (what was the opposite of educating the world, as the story went, about the unnecessary stigma around Aids?) – but her presumed innocence also contributed to her image as someone vulnerable to exploitation. This narrative prevailed in tellings of her experiences within the family, and in her 1995 tell-all interview with the BBC's Martin Bashir when she was supposedly duped using fake documents into spilling her guts on her marriage, which was, at the time, still legally intact. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "The combination of these ideas, put together with the ultimate tragic ending, was storyboard gold for movie-makers and loyal subjects alike.

William and Harry, aged 15 and 12, attempted to cope with the death of their mother in public (Charles, Harry wrote in his 2023 memoir Spare, offered a pat on the leg in consolation) and the picture of them walking behind Diana's coffin at the funeral became a vessel into which to pour a nation's worth of grief. The Queen waited for five days to address the nation, and Buckingham Palace did not fly its flag at half-mast: the cold, unfeeling Firm began to look like a worthy villain. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the years that followed the car crash there were multiple on-screen tributes to Diana, including the 1998 movie Diana: A Tribute to the People's Princess, in which she was played by Amy Seccombe, and the 2006 conspiracy film The Murder of Princess Diana, in which a fictional American journalist (played by Jennifer Morrison) digs into the circumstances surrounding Diana's death (a review in The Hollywood Reporter said that 'the production values [were] about what you might expect from a film school project'). Genevieve O'Reilly played her in Diana: Last Days of a Princess in 2007, another TV movie purporting to be a 'semi-fictionalised' account of the final two months of her life that, as well as dramatised scenes, included real news footage and interviews.

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "By 2013, enough time had passed to have another stab.

It was universally panned. In the reviews, Watts's performance came through as the film's saving grace, but while she certainly looked like Diana, and captured some of her mannerisms, her spirit just wasn't there.

It is a very different project from, say, Diana: The Musical, an aberration of culture that showed on Broadway and Netflix in 2021, in which Jeanna de Waal as Diana sang the words 'Harry, my ginger-haired son' into a cot. The Crown is a serious piece of drama that, though openly fictionalised, sometimes cuts a little too close to the truth – which is why it makes so many people so cross. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "In series four, Corrin appeared in the performance that immediately shot them, then unknown, to international superstar. They were electrifying, capturing Diana's mannerisms perfectly, imbuing her with a delicate ambivalence in which Diana was neither terrified deer nor manipulative narcissist – we felt for her, but we also understood that she was a human being with flaws. In series five, Corrin was replaced by Elizabeth Debicki, another actress who has captured the character with an accuracy that, in the 2000s and early 2010s, didn't seem possible: showing Diana in her later years, Debicki has the tiredness and resign that Corrin's Diana necessarily lacked; both actors perfectly embody the downward tilt of the head and distinctive physical presence. Debicki told Vanity Fair last year that it would be hard to let go of the character – 'It's been in my body for such a long time.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "In 2021 the Diana canon was expanded further with Pablo Larraín's experimental thriller Spencer, starring Kristen Stewart as Diana spending Christmas at Sandringham and experiencing a nervous breakdown while thinking about Anne Boleyn. Here, the narrative is focused almost entirely on Diana's inner world: she is so traumatised (and severely bulimic) that she is shown crunching down on her pearl necklace at dinner; she unravels into madness and eventually has an accident on the stairs. Stewart is captivating in a role that attempts to show Diana from the inside, rather than the person she was perceived to be by the public. But the film cannot help but add to the mythology: a woman whose spirit was destroyed by the restrictive forces of her husband's family, 'gaslit' – as Stewart put it in an interview about learning the character – and driven to madness. It's striking how the psychological language we use today can be so readily and anachronistically applied to someone whose suffering at the time had a very different tenor, no matter how legitimate it was. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Mantel wrote that 'for some people, being dead is only a relative condition; they wreak more than the living do'. Diana's death cemented her character in people's minds as exactly what they wanted her to be, making almost any interpretation of her bound to fail. But perhaps we should lower our expectations – it's already quite remarkable that we have, collectively, kept her alive for so long.
