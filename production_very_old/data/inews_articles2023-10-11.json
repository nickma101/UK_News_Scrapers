Retirement is a great example \u2013 it is a key time to plan for and an expert\u2019s understanding of an often-complex life stage could be highly valuable."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In your case, financial advice could be useful in many ways. You still have seven years before retirement and may like to discuss how best to maximise the \u00a3320,000 you have already accrued or explore the best way to access tax-free over the next few years \u2013 for example, assessing how much to contribute towards pension and  if you are not already doing so."}, {"type": "text", "text": "They will naturally encourage you to make the most of your tax-free allowances (and, if relevant, those of a partner) and they can also help ensure you are invested wisely. For example, you may need to reassess how you are invested and the ratios of  you hold (such as stocks and bonds). "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Bear in mind that investment growth remains a crucial factor because while it is only seven years before you retire, you will probably then have twenty to thirty years of retirement ahead of you once you have left the workforce.

Additionally, while you haven\u2019t indicated whether you own a property or other investment assets or savings, an adviser will also typically look at your complete financial situation, providing a foundation to help you make the most of your wealth, both for yourself and loved ones. Their experience is also likely to steer you away from the common retirement mistakes that we see so often."}, {"type": "text", "text": "While we are on the topic of advice, it\u2019s important to know that it can come in various shapes. For example, you can have one-off advice to address a specific concern, or there are also advice packages that are designed to help with common questions such as pension contributions. We should also quickly examine the two main advice types available in the UK \u2013 restricted and independent advice."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Independent financial advice is provided by financial advisers who have no restrictions or ties to specific providers or products. They can recommend products from the whole UK market, in theory, giving access to the broadest possible range of financial investments across providers. If you choose to talk to an independent adviser, I would suggest asking for a review of their historical portfolio mix and gain an understanding of how it has changed over time and across their clients. This will give you a sense for their approach and the types of choices they have made."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Restricted financial advice is when advisers are limited to a discreet set of investments that they can recommend and this is increasingly common in the UK. Restricted advisers are limited in terms of their investment recommendations but are nevertheless still able to advise a client across all their assets and should have the specialist investment and retirement expertise you need to help you make the most of your money."}, {"type": "text", "text": "You should go with whatever approach makes the most sense for you and your needs. Speaking with a qualified adviser will likely give you more confidence when you start retirement in seven years, will remove the pressure of making big decisions on your own, and should help make your retirement pot last as long as possible."}]}, {"_id": "65266ae63ad243412b7f8718", "url": "https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/money/bills/brexit-ruined-business-lost-customers-2610147", "primaryCategory": "lifeandstyle", "subCategories": "None", "title": "\u2018Brexit has ruined my business \u2013 I\u2019ve lost so many customers\u2019", "lead": "Brexit, alongside the cost of living crisis, have had an impact on Lisa Johnson\u2019s business", "author": "Imogen Tew", "datePublished": "2023-09-13 06:00:00", "dateScraped": "2023-10-11 11:29:10.654887", "dateUpdated": "(Updated September 14, 2023 9:49 am)", "language": "en-UK", "outlet": "INews", "image": "<img alt=\"\" class=\"w-100\" height=\"360\" layout=\"responsive\" src=\"https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/SEI_171222245.jpg?resize=640,360&amp;strip=all&amp;quality=90\" width=\"640\"/>", "body": [{"type": "text", "text": "Lisa Johnson was never a fan of .
