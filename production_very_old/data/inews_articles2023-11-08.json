As you suggest in your question, the key is to ensure the money is allocated appropriately – so your grandchild can make the most of this gift."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Your first consideration should be whether he has a pressing need for the funds. You say they are aged 17; will they need the funds for university or further education? If that is the case, it’s best not to take too much risk. As interest rates are high now, it’s worth exploring a fixed-rate deal for one year, and then potentially reassessing the situation.

A 17-year-old can take advantage of the rules which allow both Junior Isa (Jisa) allowance of £9,000 and cash Isa allowance of £20,000 to be used in the year they turn 18.

In addition to the 20 per cent government boost they get from paying into a pension each year, it can help instil an important sense of discipline, with a quantifiable impact later in life (they will not be able to access their pension until age 57). Understandably, however, this can feel very intangible for a teenager to appreciate today, and for some it is also preferable to see the impact of their gift earlier in their lifetime."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Staying on the topic of pensions, you can make the potential outcome more tangible by highlighting some figures. Since they can pay up to 100 per cent of their earnings into a pension each year (up to the maximum of their annual allowance of £60,000), let’s assume they can afford to put £20,000 of the £55,000 lump sum into a pension at age 18. If they then contribute £100 a month for 40 years (and supposing investment growth of 5 per cent a year, with no other assumptions), after this period they would have amassed over £2.3m."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This figure includes the pension uplift from the Government of 20 per cent each year, both on the initial £20,000 and the £1,200 yearly contribution – and it shows the power of long-term investing. If your grandchild instead waited another 10 years to start a pension, with the same assumptions, and now with only 30 years of savings instead of 40, they would have accrued just under £1.3m – over £1m less for a decade’s hesitation."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In reality, few 18-year-olds are likely to be able to start saving regularly into a pension, but this example shows that a lump sum and £100 saved a month for an extended period can lead to a very meaningful outcome. Even if your grandchild is not working, they can contribute up to £3,600 a year into a pension with the government top-up."}, {"type": "text", "text": "In order to ensure any investment reaches its potential, we would encourage your grandchild to follow certain tried and tested practices. This includes using the tax wrappers we have highlighted, such as a pension or Isa to maximise tax-free growth, to have a diversified set of investments including stocks and bonds, and to stay invested for the duration rather than trying to time the market – as this column has raised before, there are enormous benefits to following these simple steps."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Lastly, when investing it’s also crucial to monitor how much you pay in fees to have your investments managed – small differences compounded over time can be transformational and in your grandchild’s case, they will have a multi-decade investment timeframe where lower fees will make a massive difference."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Time is a key factor in shaping your grandchild’s future.

Though it’s tragic, it’s difficult to feel surprised. (Perhaps that’s why we need Williams watching along with us – it can’t ever feel normal to watch that happen to yourself.) Instead of bald sympathy, you find yourself wondering why – in light of Capaldi, and other contemporary stars like Jesy Nelson – it is still happening. Because as much as “mental health awareness” helps stars prioritise their wellbeing over their career (something Williams was not able to do, when he asked to withdraw from an 80,000-person show in Leeds and couldn’t, for financial reasons relayed to him by his manager) it still doesn’t seem to be stopping the runaway train: celebrity is as addictive and intoxicating as ever.

He played for audiences of 80,000, being injected with steroids to ward off the panic, occasionally panicking all the way through. He cried hearing people screaming his name, he freaked out at negative reviews, he riled at paps following him on holiday.
