There is certainly something to be said for direct language in place of distancing jargon that speaks more to corporate away-days than a deadly pandemic. It’s equally hard to deny the creativity of Cummings’s description of his boss’s Covid strategy as “Jaws-mode wank”, likening Johnson to the mayor of Amity in Steven Spielberg’s movie, who kept the beaches open even as a killer shark menaced the town’s shores.

In the event, he not only gave us the highly pertinent “omnishambles”, but also a strong foretaste of the vocabulary that was to come on the real political stage.
