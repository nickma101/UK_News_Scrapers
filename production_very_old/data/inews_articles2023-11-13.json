Villa took a commanding early lead and then played lower-energy football to preserve their reserves. That is an effective way to get through post-European assignments, particularly at home. Brighton, take note."}, {"type": "text", "text": "It was one of those returnees who impressed most. Villa paid £33m for Pau Torres in the summer, seen by some as a risky signing given the question marks over whether he would suit the Premier League and Villa’s multiple options in the position. Then Tyrone Mings got a serious injury and Torres stepped up to be the leader of the defence."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Torres is such a useful player for Emery’s system because he is capable of conducting the speed of play in possession. Often he plays the short, sideways passing we expect from so many teams. But his passing range, switching up to either arrow a long ball out to a wide forward or through the lines to an advanced midfielder, just makes Villa tick. He is a supreme passer of the ball and he’s doing it from centre-back. That is what Emery craves most.

What can I do in the 14 years before I retire to make my pension work harder?"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Answer: Consolidating various pension pots is often a good idea and it’s a very positive sign that you made the leap to assess your circumstances. Many can be deterred by the potential of the frustrating legwork involved, but making the switch can have a substantial impact on your financial outcome."}, {"type": "text", "text": "You seem to have done much of the heavy lifting already in terms of locating your pensions.

You will likely benefit in the first instance from having a single place to monitor your pension assets. Some firms can now provide excellent tools to help you track your investments.

For those with older pension schemes, charges may well have been high for a long period and historically there has been far less scrutiny over fees, nor a real understanding as to the effect high fees will have on the final retirement pot. It’s also likely that the underlying investment approach was based on active fund management, contributing to higher overall fees."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The evidence these days largely favours a passive approach to long-term investing, where professional managers focus on achieving the right mix of investments through Index or ‘Passive’ funds. These track the performance of indices such as the UK’s FTSE 100 and the S&P 500 in the US, rather than trying to craft a bespoke portfolio from a selection of individual stock picks.

You may find that you have been quite cautious until now, but since you have 14 years until retirement and then a long period of retirement itself, you should consider whether you need to make your money work harder.

How long this takes can vary but the good news is that, since the pandemic in 2020, there is a wider acceptance of technology which has generally made the transfer process easier and quicker. You have also helped speed up the process – from months to weeks – by having all your various scheme details to hand."}, {"type": "text", "text": "With the addition of your £200 in contributions a month, how much you can generate from your pension will greatly depend on the factors above: total annual charges, making sure your investments are diversified and sufficiently risk-weighted and having enough time to allow your pot to grow.

There will be cases where it may not be worth your while; for example, if you have contributed to a defined benefit (or Final Salary) scheme. However, many people will benefit from evaluating their circumstances, particularly those who do not have a Final Salary pension. It’s also worth remembering that you can access one-off financial advice if your situation is complex, or if you need help in assessing whether you should consolidate some pots and not others."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Many of us have accumulated numerous pension pots from a lifetime of working. Taking the time to locate them and to see whether they are fit for purpose – could they be working harder, for less cost? – will almost always reap benefits.

Many can be deterred by the potential of the frustrating legwork involved, but making the switch can have a substantial impact on your financial outcome."}, {"type": "text", "text": "You seem to have done much of the heavy lifting already in terms of locating your pensions.

You will likely benefit in the first instance from having a single place to monitor your pension assets. Some firms can now provide excellent tools to help you track your investments.

For those with older pension schemes, charges may well have been high for a long period and historically there has been far less scrutiny over fees, nor a real understanding as to the effect high fees will have on the final retirement pot. It’s also likely that the underlying investment approach was based on active fund management, contributing to higher overall fees."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The evidence these days largely favours a passive approach to long-term investing, where professional managers focus on achieving the right mix of investments through Index or ‘Passive’ funds. These track the performance of indices such as the UK’s FTSE 100 and the S&P 500 in the US, rather than trying to craft a bespoke portfolio from a selection of individual stock picks.

I refer to fees frequently in this column because unnecessarily high fees are the single biggest detractor from final retirement pots, and we can avoid them.

You may find that you have been quite cautious until now, but since you have 14 years until retirement and then a long period of retirement itself, you should consider whether you need to make your money work harder. Typically, taking more investment risk gives you the potential for higher returns, and if you have time on your side, you can sit through any periods of market volatility without having to worry about needing to draw on your funds."}, {"type": "text", "text": "You also have the opportunity to make sure you are appropriately diversified.

How long this takes can vary but the good news is that, since the pandemic in 2020, there is a wider acceptance of technology which has generally made the transfer process easier and quicker. You have also helped speed up the process – from months to weeks – by having all your various scheme details to hand."}, {"type": "text", "text": "With the addition of your £200 in contributions a month, how much you can generate from your pension will greatly depend on the factors above: total annual charges, making sure your investments are diversified and sufficiently risk-weighted and having enough time to allow your pot to grow.

There will be cases where it may not be worth your while; for example, if you have contributed to a defined benefit (or Final Salary) scheme. However, many people will benefit from evaluating their circumstances, particularly those who do not have a Final Salary pension. It’s also worth remembering that you can access one-off financial advice if your situation is complex, or if you need help in assessing whether you should consolidate some pots and not others."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Many of us have accumulated numerous pension pots from a lifetime of working. Taking the time to locate them and to see whether they are fit for purpose – could they be working harder, for less cost? – will almost always reap benefits.

Beyond him, however, the series is a moreish, compelling show following the emergency doctors of County General Hospital in Chicago. There are a whopping 15 series to enjoy on Channel 4, making ER the second-longest American hospital-based drama ever made, just behind Grey’s Anatomy (which is streaming on Disney+, but you have to pay for that)."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Click here to watch."}, {"type": "headline", "text": "Related Article"}, {"type": "headline", "text": "On TV tonight, Marcel Theroux investigates the Playboy Bunny Murder on ITV1"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Of course the currently airing episodes of Corrie are also available to watch on demand on ITVX, but why not take the opportunity to wind back the clock and watch some of the most memorable moments on the cobbles from years gone by?

Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys play Elizabeth and Phillip, two Russian spies who are operating undercover in the US, posing – along with their two children, who are none the wiser about their parent’s true nationality – as the perfect all-American family. Tense, gripping and astoundingly based on real-life events, this is a must-watch drama.

When former childhood sweethearts Celia (Anne Reid) and Alan (Derek Jacobi) rekindle their love for one another following the death of their previous partners, the rest of their families are forced to get along whether they like it or not (and for most of the time, they don’t)."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Click here to watch."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Arguably one of the best comedies to ever grace Channel 4, Peep Show is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. And unlike other classic British comedies that usually call it a day after one or two times around the block, there are nine series of Mark (David Mitchell) and Jeremy’s (Robert Webb) squabbling to enjoy on Channel 4. Start at the beginning and watch them all in order, or follow my lead and choose an episode at random. Mark’s wedding to Sophie (Olivia Colman) on episode six of series four is a personal highlight."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Click here to watch."}, {"type": "text", "text": "I shuddered when I heard ITV was going to make yet another drama about the disturbing Yorkshire Ripper murders, but The Long Shadow was far from the exploitative horror show I expected. The focus is not on the murderer, rather his victims and the families they left behind. It’s also a rare and damning indictment of the attitudes police officers had towards the targeted women, who were dismissed as they were often thought to be sex workers. If you often find yourself disappointed by true crime dramas, this is on the more subtle, respectful end of the scale."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Click here to watch."}, {"type": "text", "text": "When Lisa McGee’s hit coming-of-age comedy arrived on Netflix, it attracted an entire new audience.

The sitcom follows four teenage girls – Erin (Saoirse-Monica Jackson), Orla (Louisa Harland), Clare (Nicola Coughlan) and Michelle (Jamie-Lee O’Donnell) – and their honourary English boy mate James (Dylan Llewellyn) as they navigate growing up alongside the warzone of the Troubles.

The first is set in 1986 and catches up with the gang as Lol (Vicky McClure) and Woody (Joseph Gilgun) are preparing to get married, while the ’88 series picks up at Christmastime when Lol is struggling to cope with the trauma of her past. My favourite has to be the final series set in 1990, though, when the younger members of the group fully embrace rave culture."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Click here to watch."}, {"type": "text", "text": "When Mr Robot arrived in the UK it was only available on Prime Video, but now all four series are streaming for free on ITVX.

It takes three episodes to tell the story of how police caught Nilsen, who was responsible for the killing of at least 12 young men and boys 1978 and 1983.

The series sees the comedy pals head out across the UK to catch fish, eat heart-healthy food and stay at some of the country’s most spectacular retreats. As stunning as the bucolic scenes are, it’s the wholesome, genuine friendship between Mortimer and Whitehouse that really knits this series together."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Click here to watch."}]}]
