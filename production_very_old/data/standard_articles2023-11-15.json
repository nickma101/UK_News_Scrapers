Before starting secondary school in Dunfermline, his classmates set up a racist Facebook page about him. 'It didn't really bother me that much because I knew. I was like, you can't know me and not like me. I was actually quite confused! I was like, what? These people don't like me? I was like, that's never happened before,' he told The Guardian. 'So I was like, OK, fine. I'm just going to carry on being myself and they're going to fall in love with me sooner or later. And they did.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the end, he became friends with the boys who set up the page. 'It was really a good lesson to me about the difference between hate and ignorance. Obviously their behaviour was inexcusable. But at the same time, I was the first Black person that they probably saw in real life.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "He credits his mother as being a role model of strength and resilience. 'I grew up with a single mum, an immigrant mum who couldn't speak the language, no money, three kids on her back, coming from Rwanda, and she's done a sterling job with all three of us. I saw her struggle, I saw her fight all the time. Every day was another fight, and she always fought tooth and nail for all three of us. She just seemed to get through whatever hardship came her way. I think that's made me quite a resilient person. I look at my mum and I'm like, ‘If my mum can get through that, I can get through this,' he told The Independent."}, {"type": "text", "text": "His father had to move back to Cameroon as he couldn't get work in the UK as a Black professor, which is another sacrifice that Gatwa has acknowledged as being formative to building his resilient, hardy spirit. His father was also a minister, and sent Gatwa to bible study until the age of 15. Although he has faith, he has said that he is 'not the biggest fan of organised religion', pointing out that 'there's a lot of hypocrites in church'. While he was well behaved at home. 'Outside the house, I was a live wire,' Gatwa continued to The Independent in a 2020 interview. 'I was a wild teenager.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "In 2019, Gatwa returned to Rwanda for the first time in 12 years. His parents had nine siblings each, so there was a lot of family to see.

Auditions weren't just acting jobs, they were lifelines,' he wrote in the Big Issue. 'I couldn't tell my parents because I already felt like a mess up. I'd been warned that acting was an unstable profession and knew my parents couldn't support me financially. I had assured them I was going to work as hard as possible to make this career happen so their hard work, as immigrants who fled Rwanda and sacrificed everything for me, wouldn't be in vain. But I was falling short on my promise.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "He moved into his friend's house where he shared her double bed for nearly a year, while another mate would send him money for food every week. Still, he could only eat one meal a day and had to jump the tube barriers because he couldn't afford the fare. Without doing this, Gatwa says he would never have made it, and was planning on leaving the capital and quitting acting just before landing the Sex Education gig."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Speaking to Stylist about his character, Gatwa said: 'We talk about the silliness and the fun of the show… [but] then you get a message from somebody in Saudi Arabia or Nigeria, somewhere where being gay is illegal or there is a death penalty or it's very homophobic, and you think, f***ing hell, this show is important because it really is educational.' He then went on to recount one poignant DM from a fan in the Middle East, who told him that he is able to escape to his dreams for 40 minutes whenever he watches the show. 'The messages of the show really matter, inclusion really matters, and thorough representation really matters.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "This year Gatwa also played a version of Ken in Greta Gerwig's blockbuster Barbie, which was released in June.

One of Nintendo's stranger and more underrated offerings, Super Mario: Legend of the Seven Stars originally came out all the way back in 1996, combining the best RPG elements from games like Final Fantasy with a uniquely Nintendo look and feel."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This is a loving, and mostly faithful reworking of that original. The story remains the same: the Smithy Gang (a group of hooligans who ride around on swords as if they are pogo sticks, beautifully bonkers) have invaded Mario's world and broken the Seven Star Road (Mario's version of a rainbow bridge from Nordic mythology called the Bifrost) into seven pieces. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "It's now Mario's job to go on a quest to recover those stars and restore the road, while also walloping the Smithy gang back to whatever alternate dimension they dropped in from. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "One of the most astounding things about the remake is just how similar it is to the original. Almost every bit of dialogue, minigame and frame has been lovingly recreated, given a bit of modern-day polish and sent out into the world; the result is something that both honours the original and gives new fans something to enjoy."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Mario's little dances that he does to explain himself to other characters still make an appearance here (though they look a bit weirder now in high-def), while NPCs regularly treat him like the Mushroom Kingdom's version of Brad Pitt. And for those of you who are wondering – yes, the developers have retained the original game's dirtiest joke (maybe the whole franchise's, to be honest) by letting Mario riffle through Peach's private possessions. Why? We'll let you find out."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The biggest change is in the combat, which (for those of us raised on Pokémon) feels a lot more complex and rewarding than the original. The general premise is still the same: it's a turn-based system where Mario (and some of his friends, including newbie Mallow and old frenemies like Bowser) face off against a range of enemies."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Mario can choose to attack, defend or use his Flower Points (coyly called FP) to execute a series of devastating magical attacks.

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "And this is good, because there's a pleasing variety of enemies here – yes, there are tonnes of weenies, but they all have different weaknesses (fortunately, the playable characters all have different powers too). There are also bosses, this time around – nothing too serious, but they're beefy and require players to stay tactical rather than simply smacking them with a mallet and praying they drop dead."}, {"type": "text", "text": "So it gives the fans what they want, but will it attract new audiences? Given that many of Nintendo's biggest fans grew up with this game, it certainly doesn't hurt to give this one a bit of spit and polish – and in an age of remakes, this proves to be a classic it's well-worth upgrading.

The 'psychopaths' who engage in such behaviour (though, Peterson concedes, many of those online troll accounts are bots) need to be punished 'with a force proportionate to the punishment they wished upon the accused'.

He said last week that 212 — a thumping electropop romp about cunnilingus which Banks released in 2011 — was his go-to pre-game song.
