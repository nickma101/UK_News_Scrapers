'What the lawbook doesn't contain is an overriding principle which should be: keep the game going by blowing your whistle as little as possible,' stresses Barnes. It may sound counter intuitive but, in the eyes of new fans, a sport with 19 sub-laws about the ruck alone is self evidently at risk of drowning in the volume of its own fine detail."}, {"type": "text", "text": "And what joy, ultimately, is there to be had in a world of micro-scrutiny, endless slow-motion replays and puce-faced coaches?

As with Zelenskiy in his show Servant of the People, Morales had rehearsed his political career on TV, playing a presidential candidate in the sitcom Moralejas (Morals). (Unlike Zelenskiy, he was also notorious for performing in blackface.) Like many a populist opportunist, it is felt that Morales under-delivered on his 'drain the swamp' promises: as president he expelled a UN anti-corruption watchdog, while his brother and son were arrested on fraud and money-laundering charges.

If you think your elected representatives are lying to you, if you don't believe they're going to improve your life, the least you're going to look for is someone who might put a smile on your face.

It is notable that Izzard's Brighton campaign website makes no mention whatsoever of her celebrated comedy career.

When comedian Al Franken, a former writer and performer on Saturday Night Live, ran for the US Senate, focus groups told him his Minnesota constituents had no wish to be represented by a clown. Opponents, meanwhile, trawled his comedy back catalogue for proof of frivolous character, demanding apologies for this or that off-colour joke.

Think back to 2019's Wunderbar, when Izzard's identity as a lovable, dotty, self-ironising standup dissolved on contact with all that earnest speechifying that closed the show. 'It makes me feel really nervous that I'm doing this,' Barr told an interviewer when, long before her racist tweet row, she ran to be Green party candidate for the American presidency: 'Like I'm fucking up my whole career and my whole life.

How is it possible to elevate the simple act of kicking a football – something everybody has done and to which thousands of people devote their lives – into something this distinctive and exemplary and beautiful?"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Take West Ham's 3-2 win against Nottingham Forest on Sunday, the latest in a series of Ward-Prowse tutorials. After a couple of sighters, he delivered the two corners from which Jarrod Bowen and Tomas Soucek overturned a 2-1 deficit. And yet even to describe them as 'deliveries', with the emphasis on the outcome rather than the process, understates the intrinsic artistry of a Ward-Prowse set piece, not just the accuracy but the vicious dip and epic swerve, an artistry that no other footballer on the planet – not Lionel Messi, not Trent Alexander-Arnold, not Dani Parejo, not Alexia Putellas – can currently match."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Why did it feel ridiculous typing that sentence? Why does it feel so parodic describing James Ward-Prowse, the guy who plays centre-midfield for West Ham, who doesn't play for England and will never be nominated for the Ballon d'Or, as one of the sport's true artists? Partly, perhaps, because of the offhand way in which set-piece talent is often regarded in this country: as a largely mundane talent, a known known, almost something adjacent to the game rather than an intrinsic part of the game itself."}, {"type": "text", "text": "We also see this phenomenon, curiously enough, with one of England's most famous footballers. David Beckham inhabits many roles in the popular imagination – celebrity, icon, businessman, brand – but very few of them have very much to do with how he struck a football. And Beckham really was a genius as a ball-striker, in many ways the antithesis of the classic English midfielder. He didn't tackle or like being tackled. He didn't aspire to get bloodied or cover every blade of grass. He rarely tried to beat his man. And so English football has always felt more comfortable discussing him in the abstract than trying to understand what made him so devastatingly effective with a ball at his feet."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Certainly the technology exists to produce a finer analysis, and we know this because we see it being used every week to replay fouls and handball decisions in eyeball-straining detail. We see it being used to analyse golf swings and spin bowling and tennis serves. But what makes Ward-Prowse so consistently accurate? How does he generate so many more revs on the ball? Why can nobody else do this? And why does it look so good?"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Perhaps nobody knows. Far easier, perhaps, to gush and coo, to pore over stats and serve up an opinion about whether he could do a job in midfield for Gareth Southgate next summer. We don't talk about beauty enough in football. We don't talk enough about form. And perhaps this makes no odds to Ward-Prowse, a man who already knows those four perfect strides so intimately that he could take them in his sleep.

Rishi Sunak seemingly now realises the need at least to try, judging by a reshuffle that dispensed with the recklessly provocative Braverman and brought back David Cameron, who for all his faults was at least sufficiently consensus-minded to sustain a coalition government for five years. Though Tory MPs with seats under threat from the Liberal Democrats may be relieved to see him back, the idea that he can somehow bring the wider country back together stretches credulity: only an election can now wipe this particular slate clean.

People who had spent years plugging away in an under-reported, under-funded and lately fairly despairing field felt someone important had noticed them for once, and I suspect this week food bank helpers will feel the same. William's Royal Foundation is serious about policy detail – Andy Burnham, Manchester's mayor, told me the prince's team had been in touch months earlier asking about the city's Housing First experiment in housing homeless people with complex needs – and interested in pushing the envelope, putting funding into pilot projects that could be picked up by an enlightened future government. He isn't going to solve homelessness overnight this way any more than his father is going to solve food poverty.

It can sometimes be a normal phenomenon – often contemplating your heartbeat suddenly makes one aware of it, but palpitations, as a symptom, is the unusual awareness of them, where it feels odd.'

General Marvel fatigue was an undoubtable key driver here as well (earlier this year Ant-Man 3 was also a critical and commercial disappointment) but the somewhat confusing messaging of the trailer, bringing together disparate characters from Marvel films and shows, might have benefited from the combined charm of Oscar-winner Larson, Ms Marvel star Vellani and Wandavision's Teyonah Parris explaining via a long tail of interviews in the lead-up.

His great-great-great-uncle corresponded with Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. Khalidi's own history tracks with that of the Palestinian struggle, and he recounts working alongside the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) during the Lebanese civil war in the 1970s and early 1980s, and then fleeing with his young family as Beirut became unlivable under Israeli bombardment; the advisory role he played in the Madrid Peace Conference of 1991; and his encounters with Palestinian luminaries from Ghassan Kanafani to Edward Said to Yasser Arafat."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Throughout, Khalidi engages in nuanced self-criticism, interviewing former diplomats to understand how Israel outmaneuvered the PLO in the 1990s, during the Oslo peace process that followed from Madrid, and how Arafat and the old guard had grown out of touch with a new generation of Palestinians in the occupied territories. He uses the framework of settler colonialism to explain the success of the Zionist movement in taking the land and emptying it of its inhabitants.

Her writing is strongest when describing the formative roles her grandparents played in the Zionist movement in Europe and in the early days of the state of Israel.

The occupied West Bank city of Hebron 'felt like a hostile Arab country' to her as a young soldier hanging out there with Ayelet Shaked before she became a rightwing minister."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Tishby repeats that Israel is not a perfect country – but sees Israel as an inclusive democracy for all, whose faults are not systemic or by design but that simply get too much international scrutiny. For many audiences, especially those who didn't receive these pro-Israel messages through Hebrew school or on a Birthright trip, it's useful to see the Hasbara handbook updated for the 21st century, and the maps, bullet points and highly abridged timelines show how Israel sees itself in the world."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Khalidi understands this too, and notes that Israel's reputation abroad is 'in some ways its most vital asset'.

SodaStream, previously an Israeli company located in the West Bank, with its Palestinian workers, represents peace.

Israel is, as she puts it, 'the worst apartheid state ever', because Palestinian citizens of Israel, she says, have equal rights.

He also traces Israel's military doctrine of disproportionate force and the tremendous amount of US weapons given to Israel. What is most helpful for readers is his explanation of relevant moments that aren't directly about Gaza but explain where this war might go, like the PLO's transformation from a militant group to Israel's negotiating partner. His intimate experience of surviving Israel's onslaught of Beirut in 1982 is an eerie parallel to the accounts coming out of Gaza today."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Tishby's descriptions of Gaza are mainly focused on Hamas's determination to implement 'sharia law' there and on the rockets it has sent into Israel.

Maybe Tishby should read Khalidi to understand where Hamas came from – the generations of Palestinian leaders who were assassinated, the missteps of Arab states and the harshness of Israeli occupation."}, {"type": "text", "text": "For Tishby, the Palestinians have rejected Israel's peace entreaties at every turn. Khalidi says that the previous process toward a two-state solution was always rigged in Israel's favor and, while questioning the PLO's approach, concludes that an 'unending series of unilateral Israeli actions', backed with US power, turned the Palestinian Authority into a subcontractor of the Israeli occupation rather than a liberation movement."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Tishby writes 'It would take a Holocaust' for the Jewish state to emerge.

Given a council flat on the fifth floor of a block, the family moved to Palomeras, still in Vallecas, a traditional point of arrival for immigrants and a place with a marked social conscience and left-wing identity.

Immensely likable, a man who would play for the teachers' team against pupils at his old school, 48 but who doesn't look a day over 14, he was Rayo's captain, their everything and later their coach.

That was the first of three promotions to the top flight: first Rayo, then Huesca, then Girona. Twelve games into his time at Girona, they were 19th, in the relegation zone in the second division; two years on, given the patience that fans at Vallecas felt he was denied, they are top of the first.

After the Hamas atrocities of 7 October, during which 1,200 were killed in a violent rampage and over 200, among them children, taken hostage, we rightly saw an outpouring of sympathy for the horrors unleashed in Israel. But western leaders are mostly muted in the face of unimaginable suffering in Gaza, bankrolling Israel's battering of buildings and people, or calling only for humanitarian 'pauses', which despairing aid agencies have described as useless.

With antisemitism too often viewed as historic, its abiding contours are barely examined – not even in Britain, which invented the blood libel conspiracy against Jews that fuelled centuries of Europe-wide persecution. Antisemitism is rarely placed within a catalogue of European racism that encompassed colonialism and slavery, with each distinct and particular racism influencing the other. We have lost the lens of intellectuals in the postwar period, who excavated the connections between racism, colonialism and antisemitism. The political theorist Hannah Arendt, among others, argued that the racist violence of European colonialism in Africa both shaped and paved the way for the hateful Nazi antisemitism, premised on racial hierarchy, that led to the unique horrors of the Holocaust. After visiting the Warsaw ghetto in 1949, the African-American civil rights giant WEB Du Bois wrote that the experience gave him 'a broader conception of what the fight against race segregation, religious discrimination and the oppression by wealth had to become if civilisation was going to triumph and broaden in the world'."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Meanwhile, the common leftist view of Israel's origins as colonial is borne out by the nation's founding fathers describing it in these terms, while the Palestinians already living in that land experienced it as such in forced expulsions and dispossession.

The 21-year-old has been exceptional since joining City in the summer, scoring three goals and setting up six, and generally thrilling fans with his dribbling.

He effectively reprogrammed Jack Grealish, but Doku has not yet gone through that process which means that, more than other City players, he gives the ball away at times when they are not prepared to be countered against.

Because while reality and competition TV might broadly be as brutal as ever, Bake Off has inspired an entire, sprawling sub-genre defined by gentle kindness. I like to think of this as the Bake Off Extended Universe: a class of facsimile programming that includes shows produced by Love Productions (Bake Off's production company), closely aligned riffs developed by streaming partners, and a rogues' gallery of unaffiliated imitators."}, {"type": "headline", "text": "Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The skills may vary – between glass-blowing, haircutting, woodworking and weapon-making – but the format is the same."}, {"type": "text", "text": "An eclectic collection of amateur enthusiasts gather in a theme-specific setting (tent, warehouse, cabin, forge, etc) to battle it out across three challenges that showcase their gentle hobby.
