For example, former multi-weight world champion Mayweather retired unbeaten in 2017 with a professional record of 50-0, and he has since fought in five exhibitions.

The former UKIP leader, whose behaviour during the EU referendum campaign prompted nearly 40,000 people to complain to the police that he was inciting racial hatred, who once said working women are 'worth less' than men and that he would be 'uncomfortable' if a Romanian family moved in next-door, is entering the jungle alongside Britney Spears' sister Jamie Lynn and Fred Sirieix off First Dates."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The man smokes like a chimney and drinks like a fish, so there is a chance he will come across as a grumpy loser when deprived of these luxuries in camp, but I have a horrible feeling he might, like Hancock, experience a sort-of reverse cancellation.

Last month, he claimed he could soon be leading the Conservatives, amid speculation that he might be set to rejoin Rishi Sunak's party (he was a member until the early Nineties) – could this be the first step towards that goal?

And let's not forget, television was the making of Boris Johnson: Have I Got News For You allowed him to showcase his bungling fool act and win over the public, before he went on to become London Mayor. The appearance of his father Stanley Johnson on I'm a Celebrity in 2017 contributed to Boris's image as a cuddly, harmless figure – two years later, the bleach-blonde buffoon was PM.

'How much?!' he gloats in a grim video on his socials. Deal or No Deal's Noel Edmonds had the record fee before that, at £600,000, in 2018.

Viewers might have tried to punish Hancock by relentlessly nominating him for Bushtucker Trials – but he took every challenge on the chin and all the ritual humiliation did was endear him to the public. ITV must have known this. And it smacks of hypocrisy that non-celebrities such as Big Brother's Trish, who has been cut from the ITV show's spinoff Late & Live after offensive historic tweets were resurfaced, aren't offered the chance to redeem themselves, while Hancock and Farage seem to get nine lives.

The Marvel Cinematic Universe – the superhero franchise that has dominated the box office for the better part of 15 years – is crashing back down to Earth. It's spent the past few years drifting out of its lucrative orbit, mind you; ever since 2019's cathartic crossover film Avengers: Endgame, the MCU has struggled to curry consistent interest in its ever-ballooning catalogue of films and TV series. The latest film, The Marvels, is a sequel to Captain Marvel, which grossed over $1.1bn globally. This follow-up has opened at just $47m (£38.4m) – the lowest opening weekend for any MCU film, losing even to 2008's execrable Incredible Hulk."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The Marvels follows a slew of other recent MCU releases that have underperformed, both critically and commercially. This year's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 did fine – raking in around $845m globally. But the critically reviled Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania took in just $476.1m. Black Panther: Wakanda Forever made $859.2m – around half a billion dollars less than the original Black Panther. The streaming side, meanwhile, has fared even worse, with Disney+ series such as Loki, Hawkeye and Secret Invasion failing to make any impact on the wider cultural conversation. In a recent report on the 'crisis' at Marvel Studios, Variety's Tatiana Siegel runaway budgets – individual episodes of She-Hulk reportedly cost $25m apiece – an over-saturation of content, and the legal issues surrounding Jonathan Majors, the actor who'd been positioned as the franchise's big villain for the next few years.

It may be that viewers are losing interest in the very idea of superheroes. Film genres go in and out of fashion – musicals; westerns; romcoms. There's no reason this would be any different.

And who else has been able to get not one but three films off the ground about desperate women corseted by societal sickness and sexual dissatisfaction? Those were Safe (1995), Far from Heaven (2002) and Carol (2015), for the uninitiated – the first two helped cement Julianne Moore as one of our greatest living actors, the latter saw Blanchett and Rooney Mara ache for one another over a perfume counter at Christmas."}, {"type": "text", "text": "He's reunited with Moore for his latest film May December, a scorching, metatextual melodrama about sex, narcissism and movie stars.

May December nods to that same genre of filmmaking, revolving around the fictional villain of a Nineties tabloid scandal, whose life was dramatised in at least one TV movie.

Actor Elizabeth Berry (Natalie Portman), meanwhile, has been cast in a movie about them and arrives at their family home for a week of research. Gracie is all baby-voice and quiet predation. Elizabeth is sensual and sly, with a ruthlessness that borders on sociopathic – at one point she tells her movie's director, with hilarious nonchalance, that the 13-year-old boys auditioning for the role of Joe just aren't 'sexy enough'.

Rian Johnson's Knives Out films are largely responsible for this (the sequel, which involved a tech billionaire inviting a ragtag collection of guests to a remote retreat involves a rather similar construct), but Disney's own Only Murders in the Building has offered a farcical spin on the genre. With its rather twee title (evoking, for me, Werner Herzog's 2007 nihilistic penguin documentary, Encounters at the End of the World), you'd be forgiven for expecting AMatEotW to also be darkly humorous.

A snowstorm keeping them in the hotel? Check. A murder just as someone was about to reveal a crucial clue? Check. An uncreative but useful sounding board sidekick? Check. The fact that some of its depictions of AI ('alternative intelligence,' which Ronson prefers to call 'artificial') already feel antiquated (a supposedly amazing rendition of a chapter of Harry Potter in the voice of Ernest Hemingway feels very much within the capabilities of ChatGPT) inadvertently colludes in creating the air of a Golden Age crime novel."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Taking on these components means, ironically for a show about impossible technologies, not reinventing the wheel.

It's an autumn afternoon and the last of the day's light is spilling in through the windows of the old dark pub. The rest of the band seem chuffed with Smith's simile for their sound.

'I really thought the band was from America,' admitted Ezra Furman when introducing the track on her show. Towell laughs, recalling the moment.

It's this surprising array of sounds – a patchwork of genres reflective of their own diverse tastes (The Carpenters; The Beatles; Fiona Apple; Tom Waits) – which makes Divorce so intriguing."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Divorce have always had something a little niche about them. Back in 2021, when the band burst onto the scene, Towell was always seen sporting a blonde wig. It's since been scrapped, resulting in intrigue among fans regarding its whereabouts.

Joking aside, Towell, who is non-binary, adds, 'I think when we started this band, I was presenting very differently ... I felt I couldn't change because of the life I had at that time.' But as the band evolved publicly and personally, the wig was increasingly irrelevant. 'I wanted to be a bit more free than that ... The more non-binary I've become, the more I feel like I can do all of those things without wearing a wig.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The bandmates originally met at age 16 through the tight-knit Nottingham music scene.

In conversation, their respect for one another's talent is tangible. They use Sandstorm's absence as an opportunity to gush.

Their collaboration also shook things up; each of them took up an instrument besides the one they played. It was a new and welcome challenge. 'We were all feeling like we were s***,' says Barrow. 'We were right on the edge of what we could feasibly do.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "What they can do is all over their forthcoming EP, Heady Metal – which grapples with 'identity and being unsure of it', says Towell. 'It's about life happening quicker than you can keep up.' Tracks are relatable, but theatrical and full of imagery.

'Felix has a very high standard for lyrics,' says Towell, directing their gaze at him. 'I think it makes me vigilant and kind of brutal with myself.'

'There's a lot of self-analysis within certain situations, providing opportunities to question your responses to things,' he says. 'It comes from frustrations about things that go unsaid; injustice or imbalances you feel – and not being able to address them in constructive ways.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "By now, the group operates on instinct, meaning the subconscious is free to roam.

Smith nods along, 'It's like a letter to your future self.' Although Towell and Barrow often write independently, their process is an intuitive one. 'You can predict what the other one's going to do in a given phrase,' says Barrow.

And yes, that includes him and his fellow C-suite executives too. 'And by the way that's not just popping in, saying hi and doing your shopping – it's proper work,' noted Machin, who started his career stacking shelves in Sainsbury's as a teenager.  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "No loitering by the Percy Pig display or chatting by the Colin the Caterpillars, then. Instead, employees are instructed to find a problem and resolve it.

The policy was directly inspired by a conversation with a store worker. It's all part of Machin's theory that the long-term success of the business relies on what's happening on the shop floor, rather than conversations in boardrooms.

Earlier this year, the incoming Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan revealed his plans to don a green apron and take on a half-day shift in one of the brand's coffee shops each month.

This can lead to resentment: who can honestly say they haven't surreptitiously rolled their eyes when the big boss emerges from their glass box office into the main workspace, blinking under the neon strip lights, with an air of slight bafflement as to who all these people are and exactly what they're doing.  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "For many employees, these tensions might have come to a head during the Covid lockdown, when they got a glimpse into their CEO's mega-mansion during an all-company Zoom about, say, pay cuts and furlough.

'People may know you've worked your way up through the ranks, but when they see you doing mostly managerial stuff, they forget it,' Rice says. 'Memories are often short. 'When the boss jumps in and gets their hands dirty, it shows why they ascended the ladder. It also makes them more relatable. This can help drive trust in the organisation and leadership, and help employees feel more comfortable about talking to a manager.'

If you've got a working proficiency in management speak, you might have heard the term 'gemba walk' used to sum up this process of visiting a business's front lines. In Japanese, 'gemba' means 'the actual place', where value is created – that might mean where products are sold or fixed, or where a service is provided (it's sometimes used synonymously with 'crime scene', too, which some employees might find particularly apt…)  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "If the boss has had recent experience of what they are talking about then their voice can feel like it carries more weight"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Of course, there is always a risk that a policy like this might backfire if handled badly.

In order to avoid this potentially awkward dynamic, Brannigan recommends that these interactions take place 'without large fanfare', to make them 'less of a photo opportunity and more of a real connection and learning point'. After all, no one feels like they can be honest about the ups and downs of their work life if there's a camera pointing at them, or if they're being filmed via iPhone for the company social media accounts.  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Low key: Visits from the boss should take place 'without large fanfare' "}, {"type": "text", "text": "And, she adds, 'it should not feel like an external assessor [is] being shown the best day, with all the challenges and issues undiscussed and hidden'.

'If nothing happens, it's a paper exercise and teams work out pretty quickly that it's a PR exercise for senior leaders within the business,' says Stevens.

'Even if you're using it for work purposes,' says Malik, who represents the security awareness company KnowBe4, 'your phone still feels like a personal thing. So people are more likely to respond [to fraudulent messages], especially in the context of multitasking.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "This means that scammers catch people when they've just woken up, when they're in a rush, when their mind's on other things – times, in short, when we're not as vigilant as we ought to be. Those suspicious messages you receive – those in which scammers pretend that they're holding a parcel for you, or that they're offering you a job, or that they're the taxman, or a potential romantic partner, or your child, stranded in Morocco and short of a few grand – are all attempts to catch you off-guard. Naturally, it's always urgent; the requests flood you with panic, giving you little chance to think things over carefully."}, {"type": "text", "text": "And as far as the scammers are concerned, the wider the net they cast, the better their chances of success. Fraud is the most commonly experienced crime in the UK; we are spammed by scams. 'On my phone, I use the 'Report' feature a lot' – says Malik, referring to the reporting option on WhatsApp – 'so that blocks it. But I will get these bursts where sometimes I might even get two or three a day, for a few weeks at a time.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I might even get two or three [scam messages] a day, for a few weeks at a time"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The messages are likely to come from call centres run by criminals in the developing world. These centres seem to be increasingly active, but it's not just the frequency of these scam attempts that has changed; it's their emotional sophistication. 'That's a result of the technologies becoming more mature,' says Malik. 'To directly bypass security controls is really difficult. So criminals have spent a lot more time focusing on how they bypass the human.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "In the old days, says Richard de Vere, that was as simple as sending an email saying, 'Hi, I work in the tech department. Can I have your password please?'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "That is a method that has often worked for de Vere, who plays the role of scammer in his work at the business IT company Ultima, which tests companies' security with methods used by fraudsters. These days, employees don't fall for the 'Can I have your password?' trick. But they still fall for more subtle cons. 'A classic one, that almost never fails, is: 'Hey, I'm just wondering about what company device you have. We're doing some upgrades and we have some iPhone 15s available.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Because iPhones are widely desired, 'it's a great way of getting under the skin of people'. And it's illustrative of de Vere's theory of effective scamming. He shows me a slide of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, a pyramid with our most basic needs – food, shelter – at the bottom, and our most profound – morality, creativity, confidence, respect for others – at the top. Scammers might not be aware of Maslow's work, says de Vere, but their most effective work enacts it. People on lower incomes might be more likely to be targeted with claims that, for example, a direct debit isn't going to be met. Those whose most basic material needs are met might be more likely to fall for scams that fit into the 'Love and Belonging' tier of the Maslow pyramid. These are scams of the 'Hi Mum' variety, the kind that swindled an elderly woman out of almost £3,500 when she fell for a four-day impersonation of her daughter conducted via WhatsApp."}, {"type": "text", "text": "As for society's very wealthiest, look to the top of the pyramid. 'If you think Jeff Bezos is getting an email about his kid's last £100 quid,' says de Vere, 'forget it. Jeff Bezos is going to be targeted with something like, 'Be an ambassador for our charity.''"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Scammers can create a sense of shame and embarrassment in their victims "}, {"type": "text", "text": "The broad-brush psychological savviness of digital fraud is being supplemented by technological progress. Imagine the horror you'd feel if you received a call in which your daughter, screaming, told you she was being kidnapped. This is the reality of a particularly pernicious new scam, which uses artificial intelligence to mimic real voices."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Hearing a loved one in distress, says Sabrina Gross, triggers an immediate reaction. 'You won't think. You will spring into action and try to save them.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Gross, who spent 15 years investigating fraud with European law enforcement agencies, and who now works at the biometrics firm Veridas, says that we need to wise up to these new methods of scamming. Just as we now check email addresses, and treat package-related messages with scepticism, we should, in cases where we receive a panic-inducing call, take a deep breath. We should call the person back; we should call the police before we hand over money or personal details. The task of not being scammed requires constant scepticism. Sophie recalls another attempted scam: one in which someone impersonated her CEO on WhatsApp, to ask her to do an odd job. 'It seemed strange,' says Sophie, 'but I was eager to make a good impression in my new job and keen to make my new bosses happy. I showed colleagues and they agreed it would not be a great look to ignore it.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Only when the criminal explained that the odd job was buying 'eBay or Apple cards' did Sophie realise it was an attempted scam. 'It was another creepy example of a scammer trying to create panic to exploit a moment of vulnerability.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "This increasing inventiveness might necessitate other precautions. 'As an individual,' says Gross, 'of course I can't have a voice biometric system' – a system that conducts a computational analysis of voices in order to check that they're genuine – 'installed in my day-to-day-life, or at least, not yet. But I can have a safe word, and we can establish some ground rules of how we can safeguard ourselves, especially if there are kids involved.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "So you might agree with your family that, in times of genuine peril, you confirm your identity by using a pre-agreed safe word. ('Avocado,' suggests Gross.) And you tell your children that if they receive a horrifying, pressing call from you, they hang up and call you back. In terms of email, says Gross, 'all of us have been through this learning curve. And now we need to learn that this' – voice mimicry – 'is happening, as well.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "AI is only going to increase the sophistication of this kind of deepfake scams"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Nick France, of the digital certification firm Sectigo, recounts the use of this technique in a scam in which an energy firm executive, convinced he had just been instructed to by his boss, sent £200,000 to what turned out to be a scammer. 'In the next five years,' says France, 'AI is only going to increase the sophistication of this kind of deepfake scams, making the technology more democratised, easier to perform and more accurate to the persona they are mimicking.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "This technology, says Gross, isn't just 'Tom Cruise dancing on TikTok'. It's a powerful technology that is 'progressing constantly, very very rapidly.' We will see an improvement in our ability to label such content as spoofed, and we can hope that businesses 'actually provide these tools to people'. Yet we will always be playing catch-up: 'We're constantly chasing after the scam of the month.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "What, then, is the scam du jour this month? Or next month? Hester Abrams, of Stop Scams UK, says that 'if it's in the news, it's going to be a scam'. These scams, akin to what we might call the evergreen scams, combine vulnerability – a threat to something you care about – with urgency."}, {"type": "text", "text": "'It may have been about payday loans,' says Simon Miller, a colleague of Abrams. 'It may have been the war in Ukraine, and it is currently about the conflict in Israel and Gaza.' These scams might take the form of a purported charity appeal, like those that sprang up in the Covid pandemic, or even the pretence that a family member is in trouble."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Don't think that you're too canny to fall for fraudsters' swindles. Many of the experts I spoke to confessed to falling for scams. 'Everyone's vulnerable,' says Abrams, 'and nobody's excluded.'

Research by the University of Portsmouth suggests that Britons could be losing as much as £8.3bn per year to individually-directed fraud: more than £1,000 per person. This money doesn't go to hard-up Nigerian princes. Sometimes it goes to opportunists, but the schemes generally originate within organised crime. 'People are working in call centres,' says Miller, 'a lot of them in Pakistan at the moment, in places like Karachi, but also across southeast Asia, in horrific conditions where they are being forced to use all of these different technology platforms to seek to defraud people in the UK. And I think it's tragic.'"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The stolen money, says Miller, funds human trafficking, modern slavery, drug smuggling, and 'a whole host of hostile actors'; Malik cites North Korea as one of the entities that benefit from cybercrime."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The government has outlined a new anti-fraud strategy, and security firms are scrambling to come up with technology to counter deep fakes.
