"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Forest's ability to lose games having held a lead is unmatched in the Premier League. They have done so seven times since the start of last season, more than any other team. Part of the issue is what happens once Taiwo Awoniyi is substituted. The centre forward is coming back from injury and so was never likely to play 90 minutes, but that's par for the course. Awoniyi has never played 90 minutes for Forest in any competition and has only passed 80 minutes three times. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Awoniyi is so good at holding up the ball that, when he leaves the pitch, Forest lose an outlet (sorry Chris Wood, this isn't your thing at all).

And they're right: of course Fulham are missing Mitrovic's presence (they have scored more than once in two league games this season), but they have also failed to keep a clean sheet in six games and are asking – and expecting – Joao Palhinha to do everything. I can promise you he will get sick of that with Bayern Munich sniffing."}, {"type": "text", "text": "To that we must add the discontentment of home supporters, who campaigned last week about the greed of their club in their ticket pricing system, and the lingering resentment over allowing Mitrovic to leave without having an adequate replacement lined up.

It is typically an area of strength, purely because the Championship tends to breed defenders who are capable of headed clearances – there are typically more long balls and more crosses into the box. After promotion, you cede a little more possession and territory and therefore expect an onslaught. If you can be beaten by terrific movement, you must guard against being undone by the basics."}, {"type": "text", "text": "Burnley aren't even doing that. They actually defended pretty well in front of their own penalty area on Saturday, but repeatedly conceded chances – and goals – from wide areas. For the first, a cross comes from wide and Burnley lose the first header in their penalty area and leave Leandro Trossard free for the second. The third goal comes from a corner, with a header hitting the crossbar before Oleksandr Zinchenko's wonderful finish."}, {"type": "text", "text": "The second goal is the most alarming. When Trossard's corner is delivered, William Saliba is beyond the back post. Not only is he allowed to run beyond Zeki Amdouni (who ends up berating his teammates, for some reason), but that run is not spotted by anyone else. Saliba ends up standing in front of goalkeeper James Trafford, on his own a yard away from goal. The corner is delivered perfectly and Trafford is helpless."}, {"type": "text", "text": "This isn't good enough. An acclimatisation period is understandable and so are away defeats to high-quality opponents.

Most interesting, though, are the people he meets, who include a group of hopeful secessionists who want to estrange themselves from the rest of Australia.

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Though it has been recognised at the Country awards, 'Fast Car' transcends genre. Millions of listeners worldwide will recognise its opening notes: a hopeful melody played on plucked acoustic guitar, shortly followed by Chapman's distinctive deep voice ('You got a fast car/And I want a ticket to anywhere') and accompanied by a quiet, shuffling beat. There's a big, almost pop-rock style chorus with added instrumental depth, and all the hallmarks of classic narrative songwriting that means the track doesn't immediately slot into one category. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Its themes, too, are universally appealing. It's about getting out of poverty, escaping your circumstances, dreaming big. Chapman wrote the song when she was in her early twenties, and many listeners, including me, discovered it around adolescence or early adulthood. 'I, I had a feeling that I belonged/I, I had a feeling I could be someone' – is there a lyric that better encapsulates longing hopefulness, the feeling of leaving home for the first time, of embarking on a big trip, or simply of sitting in your bedroom striving for more?  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Though it remains acoustic throughout, the song has a big build, so you feel you're on the journey with her. The propulsive feel is exacerbated by the rhythm of the lines: in the verse, the rhythm gets quicker towards the end of each line (consider the contrast between the rhythm of 'fast car' and 'ticket to anywhere'). This device continues in the chorus when the sped-up rhythm is maintained: 'City lights lay out before us/ And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulders' – this, of course, leads to the climax: the 'I, I' cry that everyone can sing along to. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Chapman is known for staying out the spotlight – nobody was surprised by her non-attendance at last night's awards – and she is also known for her selective licensing of her songs (in 2018, for example, she sued Nicki Minaj over an unlicensed sample of her 1988 song 'Baby Can I Hold You', permission for which Chapman alleged had repeatedly denied – the case was settled for $450k). When her music is used beyond the bounds of purist listening or performance contexts, then, you know it's really special. 'Fast Car' was licensed, for example, in the finale of Lena Dunham's Girls – as Marnie and Hannah drive away from New York to Hannah's new house upstate, 'Fast Car' comes on the car stereo and Marnie begins to sing along theatrically. Rumour has it that Dunham personally called Chapman to ask her to use the song. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "'Fast Car' has been covered several times, though. In 2015 it got a tropical house remix by the Swedish producer Tobtok, and another pop-house interpretation by Jonas Blue that year. The song has had many more live interpretations, including from the likes of Sam Smith and Justin Bieber, and countless covers by aspiring singers online. When Combs released his version in August this year, it became an instant hit, reaching number two on the Billboard 100 (higher than Chapman's original at the time), and blew up on TikTok. Save for their very different voices, and the higher production quality of 2023 studios, Combs's version remains quite faithful to the original, with acoustic guitar and sparing sound effects. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "But with such a classic, it needn't have taken a cover to be revived: 'Fast Car' sits alongside the likes of Kate Bush's 'Running Up That Hill' and Fleetwood Mac's 'Dreams' in the category of songs that – as TikTok proves – transcend generations. Though this will always be her most popular song, Chapman is an artist who should be celebrated for her wider body of work, which is often spiky and political (Chapman is also heavily involved in charity work).  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "The award win for Combs's cover is controversial: writing in the Washington Post, Emily Yahr argued that the accolade was 'clouded by the fact that, as a Black queer woman, Chapman, 59, would have almost zero chance of that achievement herself in country music'. We can only hope that the more people hear 'Fast Car', the more recognition she will get – and the more new life can be given to its immortal lines.

She decided against it. 'I was writing about my and my friends' gyno-urinary-vaginal issues – everyone's vagina is in there – so I thought ‘OK, do I take out all the vaginas and the prolapses?'

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Holbein arrived in London in 1526 with a letter from Erasmus formally introducing him to More, who was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and impeccably positioned to introduce the painter to the English elite.

True to his word, he commissioned two paintings – one of himself, and the other a substantial group portrait of his family.  "}, {"type": "text", "text": "Rather than demanding his subjects sit for the duration of a portrait, Holbein worked from drawings in which he carefully modelled faces in coloured chalks and noted details of jewellery and garments.

"}, {"type": "text", "text": "The preparatory sketches, displayed here, show absolutely plausible figures, full of personality. Cecily Heron, More's daughter, looks sharp and intelligent, strong-willed and observant.

Beside her, More's adoptive daughter Anne Cresacre casts a wry look – her pale blue eyes showing a hint of boredom.

From the back, fine pin marks can be seen, following the lines of Holbein's drawing – a technique known as pouncing. Technical analysis suggests Holbein would have driven the pin through a second sheet of paper positioned underneath, and then used charcoal to transfer the delicate outline through the perforations onto the canvas as guidelines for the painting. "}, {"type": "text", "text": "The finished portrait still exists. A magnificent work in which More appears in red velvet sleeves before a dramatically swagged green curtain. It is in the Frick Collection in New York. Holbein's paintings are scattered widely among collections in Europe and the US.

In most instances (such as the portrait of More) the painting is thus represented by a tiny photo besides its preparatory drawing.

Nor was he seeking to win over the Israelis to the Arab one, 'but I want to create a platform where the two sides can agree, and not resort to knives. Either we all kill each other, or we share what there is to share'. Under this scheme, at every desk in the orchestra an Arab was to be placed next to an Israeli.
